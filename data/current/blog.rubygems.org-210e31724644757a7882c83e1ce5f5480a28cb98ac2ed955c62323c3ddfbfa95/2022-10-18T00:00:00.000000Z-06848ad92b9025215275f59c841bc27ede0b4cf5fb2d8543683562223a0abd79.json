  "content":"<p>Welcome to the RubyGems monthly update! As part of our efforts at Ruby Central, we publish a recap of the work that we’ve done the previous month. Read on to find out what updates were made to RubyGems and RubyGems.org in September.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">RubyGems News</h2>\n\n<p>This month in RubyGems, we released RubyGems <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3322--2022-09-07\">v3.3.22</a> and Bundler <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2322-september-7-2022\">v2.3.22</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The following improvements and fixes are also included in these releases (see the changelog for more information):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>added <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bundle-console</code> command in Bundler’s documentation - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5901\">#5901</a>.</li>\n  <li>updated the Bundler metadata source code URI for accuracy in gemspec - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5896\">#5896</a>.</li>\n  <li>removed warning for old TLS version connections - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5928\">#5928</a>.</li>\n  <li>removed no longer needed <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fiddle</code> hacks since RubyInstaller released patch versions to not load <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fiddle</code> on boot - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5902\">#5902</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, this month we’ve been working on migrating Bundler’s internal resolver engine to use PubGrub, which should result in much better error messages and resolution performance. We hope to release this work soon.</p>\n\n<p>We have also removed the feature of auto-sudo’ing when there are not enough permissions to perform certain operations, because it was considered harmful and hardly useful. This removal will be released with Bundler 2.4.0</p>\n\n<p>In September, RubyGems gained <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/master@%7B2022-09-01%7D...master@%7B2022-09-31%7D\">94 new commits</a>, contributed by 19 authors.

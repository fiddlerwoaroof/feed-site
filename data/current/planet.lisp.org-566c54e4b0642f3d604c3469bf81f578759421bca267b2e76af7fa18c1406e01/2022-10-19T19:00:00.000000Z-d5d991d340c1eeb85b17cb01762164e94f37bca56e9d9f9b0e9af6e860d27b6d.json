  "content":"<p>My first exposure to Lisp was in the summer of 1981.  I was taking\n  a summer school intro to computers.  The course was taught on a\n  PDP-11, and for the first few weeks we programmed in Macro-11\n  assembly language.  For the last couple of weeks they introduced\n  Lisp.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly, I wasn't impressed.</p>\n\n<p>The course started by talking about linked lists and how you could\n  navigate them with <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>.  We then\n  went on to build more complicated structures like alists and\n  plists.  This was an old-fashioned lisp, so we used things\n  like <code>getprop</code> and <code>putprop</code> to set symbol\n  properties.</p>\n\n<p>The subject matter wasn't difficult to understand (though chasing\n  pointers around list structure is error prone).  Since we had\n  just been learning Macro-11, it was natural to play with linked list\n  structure in assembly code.  We wrote assembly code to look things\n  up in a plist.</p>\n\n<p>My impression was that Lisp was centered around manipulating these\n  rather cumbersome data structures called <code>cons</code> cells.\n  Linked lists of cons cells have obvious disadvantages when compared\n  to arrays.  This makes the language tedious to work with.</p>\n\n<p>The summer school course was my first “real” college\n  course in computers.  I was put off.  “Real” computing\n  wasn't as much fun as I had hoped it would be.  I definitely\n  wouldn't be considering it as a major, let alone a career.  I wasn't\n  interested in Lisp at all.</p>\n\n<i>to be continued</i>"

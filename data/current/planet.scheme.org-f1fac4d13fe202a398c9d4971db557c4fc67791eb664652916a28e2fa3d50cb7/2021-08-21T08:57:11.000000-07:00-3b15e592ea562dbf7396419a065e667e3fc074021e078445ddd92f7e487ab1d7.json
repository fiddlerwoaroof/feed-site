It’s not as fool proof as checking for actual backlinks would\n              be, since some people do change the title somewhat, and in that case\n              gemrefinder will miss them. But it worked for me finding your reply\n              right now♥\n            \n              (By the way, I only now realize your site is mirrored on the web and looks\n                stunning!)\n            \n            That’s very flattering, thank you♥\n    "

  "content":"SRFI 240 is now in draft status.    This SRFI defines a version of\n      the define-record-type definition\n      of R6RS\n      and SRFI\n      237 that extends the define-record-type syntax\n      of R7RS, reconciling both systems.\n\n    This SRFI is meant to be adopted by R7RS-large to\n      integrate essentially the R6RS record system\n      compatibly with the existing R7RS-small record\n      system.\n    "

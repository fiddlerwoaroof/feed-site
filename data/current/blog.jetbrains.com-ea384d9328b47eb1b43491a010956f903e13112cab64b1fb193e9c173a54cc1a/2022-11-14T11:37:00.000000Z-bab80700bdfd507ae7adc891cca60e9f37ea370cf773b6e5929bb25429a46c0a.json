  "content":"<p>Our Early Access Program is coming to an end, and we are happy to announce that RubyMine 2022.3 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We invite you to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/nextversion/?_gl=1*1921ufc*_ga*MTkyMjY3OTIxMy4xNjY0ODc1NjA2*_ga_9J976DJZ68*MTY2NzQyNjM5Ny4xNTEuMS4xNjY3NDI3MzY3LjYwLjAuMA..&amp;_ga=2.225437146.1764924952.1667148446-1922679213.1664875606&amp;_gac=1.263182718.1665925393.Cj0KCQjw166aBhDEARIsAMEyZh7433tM-8yQ2sF8hAndlDTnIPXEEq3LUt6SCWWIQcz1zziT-3Ka_I0aAt4fEALw_wcB\">download</a> it and share your feedback via our <a href=\"https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/ruby\">issue tracker</a> or in the comments below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the features in the upcoming release that we have not presented to you yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved editing and adding method signatures to Ruby method definitions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In RubyMine 2022.3, we have simplified the process of writing methods with type signatures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn more about RBS support in <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/rbs.html\">this article</a>. There is no longer any need to switch between multiple files, Ruby, and RBS, just to write one method definition. We’ve implemented an easy way to edit and add new type signatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To edit type signatures, you can use the quick-fix available for the <em>Mismatched Type</em> inspection or an intention action on the declaration’s name in a Ruby file.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Add-signature-1.mp4\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If a type signature is missing, you can add it using the quick-fix for the Missing Type Signature inspection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Add-signature-2.mp4\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The actions of editing and adding type signatures are both only applicable to declarations that actually have types. This includes methods, attributes, instance/class variables, global variables, constants, and method aliases. These actions are unavailable for classes and modules as these do not have type signatures directly themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature will open the type signature file in a new tab and begin a live template on all of the type signature elements. In case of overloaded methods, one template per overload will be opened and you are able to tab between them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon completing the live template, you will be taken back to where you were in the Ruby code. The interaction is smooth and unobtrusive to your work. You can easily edit signatures without you having to manage multiple files yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Showing info from RBS in Documentation Tool Window</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve added the ability to view type information from RBS using the <em>Quick Documentation popup (Ctrl+Q)</em>. Now, if the method is described in RBS, RubyMine will display information about the parameters and return value in the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding type variables, they show up as the type variable name (e.g. public method #foo(a &lt;- T)) when the action is invoked on the method definition and as the parameter type when it’s invoked on a call.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Document-popup-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-297052\" width=\"568\" height=\"146\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Document-popup-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-297064\" width=\"569\" height=\"196\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Document-popup-3-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-297075\" width=\"572\" height=\"199\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overloads are represented not as a union of proc signatures but as one proc signature with a union for each parameter type and return type whenever applicable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/overloads-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-297005\" width=\"559\" height=\"70\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/overloads-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-297017\" width=\"560\" height=\"137\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/overloads-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-297028\" width=\"559\" height=\"115\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To view <em>Quick Documentation</em> in a popup, just hover the mouse over the necessary symbol in the editor, place the caret at the symbol and press <em>Ctrl+Q (View | Quick Documentation)</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the default settings, pressing<em> Ctrl+Q</em> (<em>View | Quick Documentation</em>) opens <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/viewing-javascript-reference.html#ws_js_quick_doc_tool_window\">quick documentation</a> in a popup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Support for the .dockerignore file type</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve introduced full support for .dockerignore files, including code highlighting and completion. These files are now taken into account when you build an image from the IDE.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dockerignore.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-297039\" width=\"652\" height=\"261\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Join the Early Access Program</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download RubyMine 2022.3 Beta 2 from <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/nextversion/\">our website</a> or via the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/\">Toolbox app</a>.

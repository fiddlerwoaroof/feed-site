  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I'm curious as to why <code>String</code> is used almost ubiquitously throughout the GHC codebase and many Haskell codebases in general. In any other language, building a string as a <code>LinkedList&lt;char&gt;</code> is practically unheard of. That being said, Haskell is not every other language, and I'm curious to hear if this representation has any benefits over a packed string type due to the GHC runtime, garbage collector, or something like that.</p> <p>Any thoughts?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ringingraptor\"> /u/ringingraptor </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/\"> r/haskell </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pffeba/on_the_usage_of_string_in_ghc/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pffeba/on_the_usage_of_string_in_ghc/\">[comments]</a></span>"

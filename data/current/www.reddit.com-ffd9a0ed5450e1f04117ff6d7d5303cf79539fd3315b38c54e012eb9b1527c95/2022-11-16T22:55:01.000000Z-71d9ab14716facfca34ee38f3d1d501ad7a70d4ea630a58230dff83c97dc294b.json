  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hello,</p> <p>Is anyone familiar if this type of program exist? :</p> <p>A custom command console that can be used as the shell for another program.</p> <p>I'm developing a hobby C++ application for which I want to add scripting capabilities using Scheme. I'm using S7 for the scripting. I would like to connect a command console to the C++ app so that I can send it Scheme commands. The console's job would be to provide the front end functionality of accepting text, displaying results (like a typical console), and sending the commands entered to the C++ app for evaluation. The C++ app would then send results back to the console for outputting.</p> <p>EDIT: I should add that one of the more important parts is being able to have multi-line commands in the front-end console, as opposed to being limited to just one line. Syntax highlighting would be an awesome addition, too.</p> <p>â€‹</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hmllwp2o7e0a1.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa54fde5a84a211e045df4eca283dd247526ffe\">https://preview.redd.it/hmllwp2o7e0a1.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa54fde5a84a211e045df4eca283dd247526ffe</a></p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vulkanoid\"> /u/vulkanoid </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/scheme/\"> r/scheme </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/scheme/comments/yx90hq/custom_external_command_console/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/scheme/comments/yx90hq/custom_external_command_console/\">[comments]</a></span>"

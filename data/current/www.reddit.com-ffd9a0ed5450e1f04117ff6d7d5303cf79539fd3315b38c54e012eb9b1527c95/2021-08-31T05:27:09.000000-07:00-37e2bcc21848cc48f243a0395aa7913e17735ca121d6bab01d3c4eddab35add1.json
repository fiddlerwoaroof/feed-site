  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I reckon the best way to get comfortable with the language is to put it to use on meaningful tasks. On that note, I was hoping to (at least, have a go at) rewrite a small, personal, script I use at work. That script requires connecting to an Oracle DB on Linux, however, and I'm not sure how to get started.</p> <p>Python and Java have cx_Oracle and JDBC/Spring (respectively) offering plenty support out of the box. From a user perspective, their respective APIs take a database name (from which, I believe, the database is resolved via. $TNS_ADMIN and tnsnames.ora) and password. I couldn't find any mention/examples that straight forward with Haskell.</p> <p>The only <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellquestions/comments/9gz3rz/advice_on_how_to_connect_to_an_oracle_database/\">related post</a> I could find doesn't offer much in terms of a solution. Do people use Haskell on OracleDB? Could I get some pointers?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/simpl3t0n\"> /u/simpl3t0n </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/\"> r/haskell </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pf4t1q/connecting_to_oracle_db/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pf4t1q/connecting_to_oracle_db/\">[comments]</a></span>"

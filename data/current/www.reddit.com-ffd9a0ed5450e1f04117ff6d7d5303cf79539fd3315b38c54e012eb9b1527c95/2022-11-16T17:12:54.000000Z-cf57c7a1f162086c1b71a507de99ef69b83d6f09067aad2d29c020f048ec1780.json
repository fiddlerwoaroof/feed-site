  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I'm pretty new to Haskell and learning it because I was interested in a pure functional language. I now know the basics of Haskell(at least I think I do), so what exactly I can build in Haskell, what is it mainly used for, and what are some distant goals we can achieve with Haskell? Can I build GUI apps in it? Is there anything similar to electron or Tauri in Haskell? is there any TUI-related things in Haskell? is there anything else I can do using it? I like this language a lot and would like to learn the rest of it by building things. Would appreciate some projects and frameworks suggestions along with any relative knowledge you guys deem worthy to know.<br> Thank you :D</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CrimsonPrince9\"> /u/CrimsonPrince9 </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/\"> r/haskell </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/ywzivw/what_can_i_do_in_haskell_uwu/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/ywzivw/what_can_i_do_in_haskell_uwu/\">[comments]</a></span>"

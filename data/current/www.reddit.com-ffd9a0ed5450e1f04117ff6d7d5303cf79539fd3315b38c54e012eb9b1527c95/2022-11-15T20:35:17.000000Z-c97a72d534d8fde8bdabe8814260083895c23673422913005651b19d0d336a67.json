What specifically did McCarthy see as wrong about the form of COND and why?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lordbalron\"> /u/lordbalron </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/\"> r/lisp </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/yw8rl2/mccarthys_thoughts_on_cond/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/yw8rl2/mccarthys_thoughts_on_cond/\">[comments]</a></span>"

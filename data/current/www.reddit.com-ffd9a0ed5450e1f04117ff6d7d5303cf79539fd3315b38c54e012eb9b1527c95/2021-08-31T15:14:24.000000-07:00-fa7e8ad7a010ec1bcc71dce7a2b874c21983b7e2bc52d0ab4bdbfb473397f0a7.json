  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I am doing some research and compiling a list of most important topics in teaching Haskell and what can be very good examples to teach those topics. </p> <p>So a list of topics that I have already listed are (Please correct me if i am wrong)</p> <ol> <li>higher-order functions (HOF);</li> <li>purity;</li> <li><strong>recursion;</strong></li> <li>referential transparency.</li> <li>Strict and lazy evaluation</li> <li>type systems.</li> </ol> <p>I would very much appreciate if you can guide me here. I am very new to Haskell and just exploring for the sake of comparison with OOP. I intend to persuade faculty to teach it as a full course.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Moist-File4795\"> /u/Moist-File4795 </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/\"> r/haskell </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pfg6kc/best_examples_to_learn_from/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pfg6kc/best_examples_to_learn_from/\">[comments]</a></span>"

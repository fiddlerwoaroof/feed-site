  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is it possible to directly modify a value by any means necessary (i.e. unsafe code permitted)? What I mean by this is there some function that takes a boxed datatype as an argument and directly changes the value that is references without using internal references such as STRef.</p> <p>So I appreciate that this would be a very dangerous thing to do and breaks referential transparency... but I have my reasons. If there is a fundamental misunderstanding here of why this is impossible within the Haskell runtime an explanation would be great!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ec-jones\"> /u/ec-jones </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/\"> r/haskell </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/yxaev0/unsafe_modifications/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/yxaev0/unsafe_modifications/\">[comments]</a></span>"

  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The yearly <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com/\">https://adventofcode.com/</a> challenges are starting soon, and this year, i wanna do them in common lisp (emacs + slime + sbcl).</p> <p>Are there any functions, macros, general purpose libraries, etc i should know / take a look at in the time before dec 1?</p> <p>I only know parts of the specification, i even failed at writing code to download my input (http download with cookies), so really anything except for the really basics helps. I know a good amount of stuff in other programming languages (mainly java) and did about a dozen small (less then 5 files) lisp projects to learn it a bit, but for this aoc i want to challenge myself to learn more common lisp.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/McModknower\"> /u/McModknower </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/\"> r/lisp </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/ywyncc/looking_for_advent_of_code_tips/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/ywyncc/looking_for_advent_of_code_tips/\">[comments]</a></span>"

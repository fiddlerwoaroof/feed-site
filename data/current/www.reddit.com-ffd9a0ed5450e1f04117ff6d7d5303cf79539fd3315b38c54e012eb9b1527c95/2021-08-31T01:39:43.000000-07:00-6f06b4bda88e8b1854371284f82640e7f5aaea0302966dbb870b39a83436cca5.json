  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have on and off used Haskell a bit and have convinced myself to use it. I just got what Monads and the like actually do and mean. I can look at Haskell code and properly understand it, but as soon as I get to actually do some excersises or anything. I put down some code and it NEVER WORKS! It's been like 6 months and I can't write basic code. For the record I can and have coded applications (and guis) in other functional programming languages but can never wrap my head around how haskell wants me to think!</p> <p>Can anyone give me any advice on how to improve or what to think when coding in Haskell?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> <p>CLARITY: I like the GHC compiler but can't get the result I am looking for. I have read the &quot;Learn you a haskell for the great good&quot; book. I am currently going through 99 problems in haskell. The real problem <em>i think i am having</em> is recursion. I can only really code in (and have only properly tried) FP Languages like Lisp especially Common Lisp. </p> <p>â€‹</p> <p>Edit 0: English</p> <p>Edit 1: Clarity</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrPotatoRice\"> /u/MrPotatoRice </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/\"> r/haskell </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pf1tg4/how_to_think_haskell/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pf1tg4/how_to_think_haskell/\">[comments]</a></span>"

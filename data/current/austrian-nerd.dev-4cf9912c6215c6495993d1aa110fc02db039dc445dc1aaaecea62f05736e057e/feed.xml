          Many Ruby developers don’t have time to keep up to date with the recent developments inside Ruby core. To make this easier I decided to write up the most recent progress that is happening inside the [Ruby Bug tracker](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org). I won’t summarize bug tickets, but only feature proposals. But if an important Bug ticket rises I will mention it at the end.

          With the recent events surprising quite a lot of us, anxiety about a third world war skyrocketed. Especially after the thread of a nuclear attack, everyone heard the term “nuclear winter”. What does this mean? Would it be the end of humanity?

          When we write software, one of the biggest issues is how should we handle the state? The user has a form to fill in and updates the fields. Should the data, thus the state, be saved in an object or be managed by a library so that we have easy access to it in other places as well? Or should the state just be reflected in the DOM with the value of the input fields?

          Tailwind created a lot of hype recently. But with all the hype there, of course, comes plenty of backlash as well. What are some of the critiques Tailwind is facing? And how did they hold true for me — a full-stack developer that likes the backend way more than the frontend?

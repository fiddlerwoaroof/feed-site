  "content":"<p>Hi everyone, exceptionally, our September meeting will take place on a Tuesday evening rather than our traditional Mondays to avoid the conflict with the elections.</p>\n<p>We are looking for presenters for the event. If you work on a Python project, we want to see it. Maybe you have created a machine learning algorithm to predict who will win on the 20th? It would be interesting to share its internals with the community.</p>\n<p>The rendez-vous will take place on September 22 at 6pm (Montréal time). Send up your talk proposal to <a href=\"mailto:mtlpyteam@googlegroups.com\">mtlpyteam@googlegroups.com</a>. Presentations can be anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes. We will accept any reasonable proposals until the program is full. We are looking forward to reading yours. </p>\n<p>More details on <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Montreal-Python/events/279896005/\">the Meetup page of the event</a>.</p>"

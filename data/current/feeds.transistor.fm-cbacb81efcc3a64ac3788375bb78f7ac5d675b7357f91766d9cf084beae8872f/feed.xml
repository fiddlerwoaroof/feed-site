        <![CDATA[<p><b>The Ruby Blend - Episode 20</b></p><p>Welcome to The Ruby Blend! It's been awhile and it sure feels good to back in the swing of things! Today, we have a new panelist with us, Dave Kimura, who's been doing Ruby for quite some time, as well as doing the <em>Drifting Ruby</em> screencast for over five years now. On this episode, we dive into the topic of Service Object, where do they belong in your app and how do you name it in Ruby on Rails. We discuss namespacing and how to name interactors the correct way. Dave elaborates on Active Storage since he did an episode on <em>Drifting Ruby</em> about it.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>The Ruby Blend - Episode 18</strong></p><p><br>Welcome to The Ruby Blend! The guys catch up on what's been going on this week. Ron has been taking an insurance class with his work to learn the ins and outs of the insurance industry, Nate's been busy working with Code Fund becoming an independent company, and Andrew has been on the interviewing circuit trying to find a new job. This leads us to the topic of today's episode, which is "Interviewing." The guys chat all about all the different things they've experienced over the years with the interviewing process and all the different things they've encountered with finding new jobs over the years. They do have some bits of advice to share as well. Andrew lets us know what he's been having to do currently with his interviewing process. And why is Andrew not allowed to go bowling anymore?

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>The Ruby Blend - Episode 17</strong></p><p><br>Welcome to The Ruby Blend! On today's episode, we have a special guest, Brittany Martin, who is Lead Web Developer for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, where she is part of a team that develops the non-profits ticketing and festival web application and is also the host of the Ruby on Rails Podcast on the 5 by 5 Network. Brittany is here to tell us all about what she does, gem wrappers, and she is seeking some counsel from the guys today on various things. We talk about how important Readme's are, useful tools for documentation, a project from Evil Martians, a gem called Combustion, and RSpec API documentation is discussed. We end with Brittany telling us all about her passion for being in the Roller derby.

</ul><p>Guests:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.therubyblend.com/guests/brittany-martin">Brittany Martin</a></li></ul><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><p><br>[00:01:51] We start here by Brittany telling us all about gem wrappers<br> and what she's working on. She asks the guys if it makes sense to create<br> an almost fake Rails app that she ships along with the certificate or<br> ship beside it that shows a user how to use it? Andrew answers and<br> mentions reading a lot of code from Vladimir, who goes by palkan, and<br> Brittany mentions Piotr Murach, who wrote a great article about writing<br> gem specs.</p><p> [00:07:14] Brittany asks the guys if they ship their VCR cassette<br> tapes with their code and do they find it useful or do they think that<br> VCR cassette tapes should be ephemeral?</p><p> [00:13:25] Nate tell us how he markets his open source repositories<br> and when he has a new project that he is excited about, what kind of<br> steps he takes.</p><p> [00:15:13] Brittany asks the guys what does it feel like when you<br> publish a library and people start opening issues with it? Is it a weird<br> mix of joy and a little bit of panic or are you just excited overall?</p><p> [00:17:27] Ron asks Nate if he has any advice on how to build that<br> initial community and for getting those initial enthusiasts. Nate brings<br> up a video from Derek Sivers about "How to start a movement." Great<br> advice from Nate here and an awesome quote!<br> </p><p> [00:20:17] Andrew talks about setting up a Rails App, how important<br> Readme's are, and he mentions a repo that he points to a lot called<br> Awesome Readme's." He also mentions documentations have to be good, and<br> he tells us resources to help with this, which is a project from Evil<br> Martians, Read the Docs, and GitBook.<br> </p><p> [00:24:10] Brittany wants to know when do you outgrow your Readme and<br> are all the tools that you offered better than using GitHub Wiki?<br> Brittany mentions how she was stoked to get the Google Pay as the gem<br> name.</p><p> [00:28:15] With the example Rails project that Brittany wants to ship<br> with the gem, she wonders if it should be part of the gem itself or<br> should it be a separate repository? Andrew and Nate help out with this.</p><p> [00:31:55] Andrew talks about if you're worried about hard to debug<br> tickets, he created a reproduction template on how to quickly and easily<br> reproduce your issue. Also, if you want a community, he suggests<br> creating a place for them. He mentions Jared White, maintainer of<br> Bridgetown, R.B. Andrew asks Brittany why did she decide to develop it<br> in private rather than putting it in as a work in progress as the<br> status, or the gem description, and if you try it then it's on you?<br> <br> [00:38:26] Brittany tells us her empathy with Rails engines, and if<br> she's done a local path to a locally sourced engine as well.</p><p> [00:40:58] Andrews tells us about a Gem called "Combustion" that helps<br> with engine testing that palkan uses a lot.<br> <br> [00:42:33] Andrew asks everyone when you write gems do you use yard?<br> Brittany mentions RSpec API documentation which she's used in past jobs<br> and is pretty amazing.<br> <br> [00:46:10] Andrew talks about the tool "docsify" and an Evil Martians<br> blog post about it.<br> <br> [00:46:56] Brittany talks about her passion of being in the Roller<br> Derby, under the name Norma Skates, after Norman Bates.</p><p><br><strong>Links Mentioned:</strong></p><ul>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>The Ruby Blend - Episode 17</strong></p><p><br>Welcome to The Ruby Blend! On today's episode, we have a special guest, Brittany Martin, who is Lead Web Developer for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, where she is part of a team that develops the non-profits ticketing and festival web application and is also the host of the Ruby on Rails Podcast on the 5 by 5 Network. Brittany is here to tell us all about what she does, gem wrappers, and she is seeking some counsel from the guys today on various things. We talk about how important Readme's are, useful tools for documentation, a project from Evil Martians, a gem called Combustion, and RSpec API documentation is discussed. We end with Brittany telling us all about her passion for being in the Roller derby.

</ul><p>Guests:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.therubyblend.com/guests/brittany-martin">Brittany Martin</a></li></ul><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><p><br>[00:01:51] We start here by Brittany telling us all about gem wrappers<br> and what she's working on. She asks the guys if it makes sense to create<br> an almost fake Rails app that she ships along with the certificate or<br> ship beside it that shows a user how to use it? Andrew answers and<br> mentions reading a lot of code from Vladimir, who goes by palkan, and<br> Brittany mentions Piotr Murach, who wrote a great article about writing<br> gem specs.</p><p> [00:07:14] Brittany asks the guys if they ship their VCR cassette<br> tapes with their code and do they find it useful or do they think that<br> VCR cassette tapes should be ephemeral?</p><p> [00:13:25] Nate tell us how he markets his open source repositories<br> and when he has a new project that he is excited about, what kind of<br> steps he takes.</p><p> [00:15:13] Brittany asks the guys what does it feel like when you<br> publish a library and people start opening issues with it? Is it a weird<br> mix of joy and a little bit of panic or are you just excited overall?</p><p> [00:17:27] Ron asks Nate if he has any advice on how to build that<br> initial community and for getting those initial enthusiasts. Nate brings<br> up a video from Derek Sivers about "How to start a movement." Great<br> advice from Nate here and an awesome quote!<br> </p><p> [00:20:17] Andrew talks about setting up a Rails App, how important<br> Readme's are, and he mentions a repo that he points to a lot called<br> Awesome Readme's." He also mentions documentations have to be good, and<br> he tells us resources to help with this, which is a project from Evil<br> Martians, Read the Docs, and GitBook.<br> </p><p> [00:24:10] Brittany wants to know when do you outgrow your Readme and<br> are all the tools that you offered better than using GitHub Wiki?<br> Brittany mentions how she was stoked to get the Google Pay as the gem<br> name.</p><p> [00:28:15] With the example Rails project that Brittany wants to ship<br> with the gem, she wonders if it should be part of the gem itself or<br> should it be a separate repository? Andrew and Nate help out with this.</p><p> [00:31:55] Andrew talks about if you're worried about hard to debug<br> tickets, he created a reproduction template on how to quickly and easily<br> reproduce your issue. Also, if you want a community, he suggests<br> creating a place for them. He mentions Jared White, maintainer of<br> Bridgetown, R.B. Andrew asks Brittany why did she decide to develop it<br> in private rather than putting it in as a work in progress as the<br> status, or the gem description, and if you try it then it's on you?<br> <br> [00:38:26] Brittany tells us her empathy with Rails engines, and if<br> she's done a local path to a locally sourced engine as well.</p><p> [00:40:58] Andrews tells us about a Gem called "Combustion" that helps<br> with engine testing that palkan uses a lot.<br> <br> [00:42:33] Andrew asks everyone when you write gems do you use yard?<br> Brittany mentions RSpec API documentation which she's used in past jobs<br> and is pretty amazing.<br> <br> [00:46:10] Andrew talks about the tool "docsify" and an Evil Martians<br> blog post about it.<br> <br> [00:46:56] Brittany talks about her passion of being in the Roller<br> Derby, under the name Norma Skates, after Norman Bates.</p><p><br><strong>Links Mentioned:</strong></p><ul>

        <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to The Ruby Blend! On today’s episode, we have special guest, Nick Haskins, who works as a full-time solo Dev for CG Cookie and a year later he launched Blender Market. Both sites were started on WordPress but eventually outgrew the platform. Without any prior experience with Ruby on Rails, he built both apps from scratch and spent the next few years fixing, learning, and maintaining those platforms. Today, he is going to tell us all about his book he recently published called, Playbook Thirty-nine. There’s an interesting story how he came up with the name. He also tells us about his new platform called Mavenseed. Also, Nick lets us know how it’s been traveling and living the nomadic lifestyle in an RV with his family.

He asks the guys what they think about architecture in that sense? </p><p>[00:05:25] Andrew brings up single responsibility pattern. Ron says patterns are dangerous, Nate likes them, and Andrew shares a story of patterns and a video that Chris Oliver did on refactoring that helped him. </p><p>[00:14:07] Nate brings up things that Sandi Metz’s teaches about extreme object orientation. She has so many great ideas and the way she forces you to think about your code differently. </p><p>[00:18:27] Nate brings up videos with DHH talking about Basecamp code. He had some interesting information about where software development gets interesting.

He asks the guys what they think about architecture in that sense? </p><p>[00:05:25] Andrew brings up single responsibility pattern. Ron says patterns are dangerous, Nate likes them, and Andrew shares a story of patterns and a video that Chris Oliver did on refactoring that helped him. </p><p>[00:14:07] Nate brings up things that Sandi Metz’s teaches about extreme object orientation. She has so many great ideas and the way she forces you to think about your code differently. </p><p>[00:18:27] Nate brings up videos with DHH talking about Basecamp code.

He<br> also tells us how long he's been programming professionally and with<br> Ruby on Rails.</p><p>[00:04:24] Nate is wondering what Julian's observation is about the<br> relationship between music and programming or any type of artistic<br> endeavor in programming. Nate mentions a book by Paul Graham called,<br> "Hackers and Painters."</p><p>[00:06:43] Nate found it interesting that as an experienced<br> programmer, Julian found it intimidating when he first encountered<br> Rails, but had good mentors and friends to help him. He wonders if it<br> was an existing Rails application or was it a new application he was<br> building? Julian explains.</p><p>[00:10:34] Andrew is curious to know what Julian uses Ruby for now and<br> what his day to day use of Ruby is. Julian mentions doing backend mobile<br> stuff and what he's done.</p><p>[00:14:25] Julian gives a shout-out to Chris Oliver for Jumpstart Pro<br> App which helped him a lot. Also, he explains his experience with it<br> because Andrew is curious.</p><p>[00:16:20] Nate is curious to know if a tool in Jumpstart Rails helps<br> or is it introducing more magic? Also, if he came into the project or if<br> it was a new project and he began with Jumpstart, would he have found<br> Rails more approachable? Julian gives us his opinion.</p><p>[00:21:43] Nate brings up how he agrees with Julian that he thinks<br> three are more things we can do on the Rails community to make it more<br> approachable to newcomers. Julian has a story to share and Andrew<br> mentions a Tweet that was made by Noel Rappin in response to this.</p><p>[00:25:21] Nate is curious to know if Julian watched any of the old<br> RailsCasts episodes. He makes a point to say how watching these<br> teaching, tutorial websites, and videos are so important to the health<br> of community. Julian lets us know what he did.</p><p>[00:27:57] Andrew brings us a point by saying that with all the new<br> additions to Rails, it's fair to say that the documentation hasn't kept<br> up with the new features that are getting added in. Nate agrees with<br> this and gives his input as well.</p><p>[00:29:49] Julian talks about his website he created called, "Better<br> StimulusJS."</p><p>[00:32:24] Andrew wants Julian to touch on how he found Stimulus<br> Reflex and if he's using it on client projects.

He lets us know<br> right here.</p><p>[00:13:05] Andrew is curious and asks Eric what were the signs that<br> you realized it was time to bring in more people, specifically on the<br> code side, and what was the motivating factor to bring in someone else?<br> He gives a little bit of history behind it.</p><p>[00:20:28] Since Eric has taken on other responsibilities, Nate asks<br> him to talk about the dopamine hits that he feels in taking on other<br> roles as compared to development and also to talk about whether or not<br> he's missed development and what the experience has been for him.</p><p>[00:28:38] Nate asks Eric if he's been able to get more into the code<br> and if he's starting to experience some of that knowledge work, the<br> dopamine hit from shipping code. He's got a great answer.</p><p>[00:32:38] Eric picks on Andrew here for a bit, but it's a rather nice<br> kind of picking and you'll see why. Andrew chimes in as well.</p><p>[00:38:46] Nate is curious because it sounds like Eric may have hit a<br> couple of interesting barriers as he was getting back into code. He asks<br> Eric if he can touch on this. Apparently, he rediscovered that code can<br> be hard too.</p><p>[00:41:38] Eric has something to say about anyone curious about<br> developing on Windows. Also, Nate asks him if there was anything that<br> stuck out as difficult on Windows for him and he tells us what was<br> difficult.</p><p>[00:47:52] Eric says if you're not following Andrew on Twitter and<br> GitHub then you really, really should, and he explains why.</p><p>[00:49:30] Eric has some great things to say to the guys to end the<br> episode.</p><p>Links</p><ul>

</ul><p>Guests</p><ul><li>Eric Berry</li></ul><p>Sponsor</p><p><a href="https://promo.linode.com/rubyblend/">Linode</a></p><p>Show Notes</p><p>[00:01:12] Eric tells us the story of how he found the inspiration for<br> CodeFund as a company.</p><p>[00:09:24] Nate asks Eric what kind of resistance he had at the<br> beginning from the developers that he was pitching his ideas to, and he<br> explains.</p><p>[00:12:35] If Eric condensed CodeFund's mission down to an elevator<br> pitch, what would it be and how would he summarize it? He lets us know<br> right here.</p><p>[00:13:05] Andrew is curious and asks Eric what were the signs that<br> you realized it was time to bring in more people, specifically on the<br> code side, and what was the motivating factor to bring in someone else?<br> He gives a little bit of history behind it.</p><p>[00:20:28] Since Eric has taken on other responsibilities, Nate asks<br> him to talk about the dopamine hits that he feels in taking on other<br> roles as compared to development and also to talk about whether or not<br> he's missed development and what the experience has been for him.</p><p>[00:28:38] Nate asks Eric if he's been able to get more into the code<br> and if he's starting to experience some of that knowledge work, the<br> dopamine hit from shipping code. He's got a great answer.</p><p>[00:32:38] Eric picks on Andrew here for a bit, but it's a rather nice<br> kind of picking and you'll see why. Andrew chimes in as well.</p><p>[00:38:46] Nate is curious because it sounds like Eric may have hit a<br> couple of interesting barriers as he was getting back into code. He asks<br> Eric if he can touch on this. Apparently, he rediscovered that code can<br> be hard too.</p><p>[00:41:38] Eric has something to say about anyone curious about<br> developing on Windows. Also, Nate asks him if there was anything that<br> stuck out as difficult on Windows for him and he tells us what was<br> difficult.</p><p>[00:47:52] Eric says if you're not following Andrew on Twitter and<br> GitHub then you really, really should, and he explains why.</p><p>[00:49:30] Eric has some great things to say to the guys to end the<br> episode.</p><p>Links</p><ul>

        <![CDATA[<p>Panelists</p><ul>
<li>Ron Cooke</li>
<li>Nate Hopkins</li>
<li>Andrew Mason</li>
</ul><p>Sponsor</p><p><a href="https://promo.linode.com/rubyblend/">Linode</a></p><p>Show Notes</p><p>[00:03:13] GitHub sponsors starts the talk on this episode, and how a<br> few people have reached out about Stimulus Reflex asking how they can<br> support the project and the various contributors. Ron shares what he's<br> done.</p><p>[00:05:30] Ron has been working on ramping up a Legacy Rails App that<br> fell out of maintenance and it was a lot more painful than he wanted it<br> to be with Gem conflicts and Gem lock files. He gives a lesson on what<br> you should do.</p><p>[00:10:29] Ron gives great advice that it is so important to keep your<br> tests up to date. If it wasn't for the tests that he has at his current<br> job, he would be "sunk."</p><p>[00:15:04] Nate is curious and asks Andrew if he can talk about<br> specifics about why he was getting "chastised" on making a change in the<br> app and it messed up something else. He talks about what happened and<br> how it was fixed. Ron brings an interesting point about "bugs" and what<br> a "bug" actually is.</p><p>[00:18:49] Andrew puts a plug in for Jason Swett, who has a podcast he<br> does on Rails and he puts a lot of testing materials around Rails, so<br> you should check it out.</p><p>[00:19:25] Ron asks the guys when they are writing tests and if they<br> write tests first or last, and how do they feel about it?</p><p>[00:25:24] Talking about tests and "hairy" problems, Nate and Andrew<br> recently had a deep pair session with Stimulus Reflex Sessions, so Nate<br> explains what happened.</p><p>[00:32:18] Andrew announced that along the "JavaScripty" side of<br> Stimulus Reflex, Web Packer 5 came out and then 5.0.1. He asked if Ron<br> ugraded and what version of Rails he is on, which is then followed by<br> laughs.</p><p>[00:33:49] Nate wants to know what is on Webpacker 5 so Andrew<br> explains what they've added. Ron is curious to know how many people or<br> how many projects are using it. If anyone knows, tweet the guys at the<br> Ruby Blend on Twitter to let them know.</p><p>[00:41:17] Ron talks about how it's been for him working remotely from<br> home for a full week. He explains why it's been a little rough for him.<br> Nate also talks about his kids being home and how it's been challenging.</p><p>[00:46:25] Andrew has a quick hack if you need a good router. He<br> really likes Nighthawk from NetGear. He also talks about upgrading to<br> Cat 6 cables to boost your speed.</p><p>[00:47:15] Andrew brings up with the massive shifts and changes we are<br> going through, and how is it going to have an impact on college<br> educations and if it will lower the value of a college education doing<br> online school. Nate and Ron share their views on this as well.</p><p>[00:53:50] Andrew mentions they would love if you could rate them on<br> iTunes or hit the star in the Overcast player. Also, you could write<br> reviews to help them continue to make more content and get some guests<br> on the show.</p><p><br>Links</p><ul>

        <![CDATA[<p>Panelists</p><ul>
<li>Ron Cooke</li>
<li>Nate Hopkins</li>
<li>Andrew Mason</li>
</ul><p>Sponsor</p><p><a href="https://promo.linode.com/rubyblend/">Linode</a></p><p>Show Notes</p><p>[00:03:13] GitHub sponsors starts the talk on this episode, and how a<br> few people have reached out about Stimulus Reflex asking how they can<br> support the project and the various contributors. Ron shares what he's<br> done.</p><p>[00:05:30] Ron has been working on ramping up a Legacy Rails App that<br> fell out of maintenance and it was a lot more painful than he wanted it<br> to be with Gem conflicts and Gem lock files. He gives a lesson on what<br> you should do.</p><p>[00:10:29] Ron gives great advice that it is so important to keep your<br> tests up to date. If it wasn't for the tests that he has at his current<br> job, he would be "sunk."</p><p>[00:15:04] Nate is curious and asks Andrew if he can talk about<br> specifics about why he was getting "chastised" on making a change in the<br> app and it messed up something else. He talks about what happened and<br> how it was fixed. Ron brings an interesting point about "bugs" and what<br> a "bug" actually is.</p><p>[00:18:49] Andrew puts a plug in for Jason Swett, who has a podcast he<br> does on Rails and he puts a lot of testing materials around Rails, so<br> you should check it out.</p><p>[00:19:25] Ron asks the guys when they are writing tests and if they<br> write tests first or last, and how do they feel about it?</p><p>[00:25:24] Talking about tests and "hairy" problems, Nate and Andrew<br> recently had a deep pair session with Stimulus Reflex Sessions, so Nate<br> explains what happened.</p><p>[00:32:18] Andrew announced that along the "JavaScripty" side of<br> Stimulus Reflex, Web Packer 5 came out and then 5.0.1. He asked if Ron<br> ugraded and what version of Rails he is on, which is then followed by<br> laughs.</p><p>[00:33:49] Nate wants to know what is on Webpacker 5 so Andrew<br> explains what they've added. Ron is curious to know how many people or<br> how many projects are using it. If anyone knows, tweet the guys at the<br> Ruby Blend on Twitter to let them know.</p><p>[00:41:17] Ron talks about how it's been for him working remotely from<br> home for a full week. He explains why it's been a little rough for him.<br> Nate also talks about his kids being home and how it's been challenging.</p><p>[00:46:25] Andrew has a quick hack if you need a good router. He<br> really likes Nighthawk from NetGear. He also talks about upgrading to<br> Cat 6 cables to boost your speed.</p><p>[00:47:15] Andrew brings up with the massive shifts and changes we are<br> going through, and how is it going to have an impact on college<br> educations and if it will lower the value of a college education doing<br> online school. Nate and Ron share their views on this as well.</p><p>[00:53:50] Andrew mentions they would love if you could rate them on<br> iTunes or hit the star in the Overcast player. Also, you could write<br> reviews to help them continue to make more content and get some guests<br> on the show.</p><p><br>Links</p><ul>

Ron explains how things like deploys are much easier and fast<br> to do now, the differences in traffic, and the use of traditional Rails<br> background jobs.</p><p>[00:06:23] Ron, Andrew, and Nate discuss the benefit of Rails monolith<br> framework and how it ends up being a single deployed distributed system.</p><p>[00:10:11] From the, "Nate, please make this a gem file," Nate talks<br> about his layered cache he added to CodeFund which IMMENSELY sped up<br> average response time on the server side well below the 100ms, half of<br> what it was before. Nate goes into details how he did it. Kind of neat!<br> Andrew is flexing hard!</p><p>[00:12:09] Andrew brings up the news of GitHub buying out JavaScript<br> developer platform, NPM. Microsoft is again strengthening its hold on<br> Open Source. Is this a positive thing?</p><p>[00:16:05] Coronavirus has caused a lot of other businesses to make<br> their employees work at home. At Dev's, quite a few of us already have<br> been in that world for years. Haven't we been training for this our<br> whole lives? Ron's current job has had him working out of the office and<br> now transitioned to home. He discusses how that is going. Did his<br> company have a plan in place? Using remote tools like Tuple to stay<br> connected with the team, and (ugh) email. Nate brings up Hey.com's new<br> email client.</p><p>[00:20:06] Like a lot of us, Andrew has a lot of unread emails. How<br> many? Find out. Andrew you are NOT alone. The guys go in-depth on email<br> clients and apps.</p><p>[00:26:27] How do you get in the "deep creative work" zone especially<br> if you have meetings and other things interrupting your day? Do you<br> block off time like Ron? Do you just work late at night? Are you like<br> Nate and use 5 minutes of music to get you in the zone?</p><p>[00:33:03] Things that interrupt or even help you procrastinate<br> getting into the deep work. Find out the one thing they shut off to stop<br> the interruption.</p><p>[00:35:35] Social distancing is causing lots of people to be out of<br> work.

Andrew has submitted, have you?</p><p>[00:47:39] Andrew's timing is amazing. He really didn't want to do the<br> Ruby Meetup initially, but now with things like RailsConf getting<br> cancelled &amp; COVID-19...he "may" be all in now?!

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>

<p>[00:00:00] In this episode, we’ll be digging deeper into the Ruby trends, how the Ruby conference went down, and how our panelists got into programming. Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. The Ruby conference was excellent and resourceful, not to mention the superb food.</p>

<p>[00:00:41] Pattern matching is a trend that we are seeing with Ruby. It is pretty much a case statement, but you can pattern match, and you get all the benefits of pattern matching. Like if you create a structure with variables in it, then those variables are now assigned to the values that are matched. Ruby rails 6.0 is coming with a bunch of fixes for active record that went out. Active records are essential because they make work easier.</p>

<p>[00:03:45] One of the keynote speakers at the Ruby conference, Sandy Metz, reminded the attendee how lucky they are to be in this career. So how did our panelists get into this career?</p>

<p>[00:09:25] Nate: He is a programmer with over 20 years of experience. He has been doing Ruby for 10 years. He got into programming through design. Before getting into Ruby programming, Nate used several other languages like HTML, JavaScript, C sharp, and Visual Basics.</p>

<p>[00:11:36] Andrew: His love for computers started as a child. In high school, he took computer sciences courses and studied languages like visual basic, HTML, CSS, Java, and Javascript. He went to college and for a degree in computer science. He studied PHP, Java, and Python. In college, he decided to try web design for him to make some money, and he ended up learning HTML and CSS. To sharpen his design skills, he served as an intern in a graphic design company. He is currently working on code fund.</p>

<p>[00:14:27] Ron: His interest in computers started as a child. He wrote his first line of code at the age of 11. Ron attended a magnet high school that was for computer science and proceeded for computer engineering. Computer Engineering did not sit well with him, and he dropped out to do low voltage installation, which he had learned as a kid. He worked as an operations manager in a company. His work involved managing technicians. It became cumbersome to handle the work in Excel, and he decided to write software to make his work easier. </p>

<p>[00:15:51] He learned PHP and later discovered Ruby. Currently, he works with Nate. According to Ron, programming is all about problem-solving.<br>
Also, we get to hear some of the odd jobs that Nate, Ron, and Andrew had to take. Programming is not a walk in the park, and neither is it a cake party. </p>

<p>[00:50:27] There is a challenge in the career, and our panelist today will share with us some of the challenges. For instance, having to deal with a bug for a straight 48 hours, people thinking that you are trying to be smart without addressing their issues or people become too rigid to change.</p>

[00:00:00] In this episode, we’ll be digging deeper into the Ruby trends, how the Ruby conference went down, and how our panelists got into programming. Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. The Ruby conference was excellent and resourceful, not to mention the superb food.

[00:00:41] Pattern matching is a trend that we are seeing with Ruby. It is pretty much a case statement, but you can pattern match, and you get all the benefits of pattern matching. Like if you create a structure with variables in it, then those variables are now assigned to the values that are matched. Ruby rails 6.0 is coming with a bunch of fixes for active record that went out. Active records are essential because they make work easier.

[00:03:45] One of the keynote speakers at the Ruby conference, Sandy Metz, reminded the attendee how lucky they are to be in this career. So how did our panelists get into this career?

[00:09:25] Nate: He is a programmer with over 20 years of experience. He has been doing Ruby for 10 years. He got into programming through design. Before getting into Ruby programming, Nate used several other languages like HTML, JavaScript, C sharp, and Visual Basics.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Gratipay is shutting down at the end of the year</em></p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Gratipay is dead. <a href="https://gratipay.news/vive-la-liberapay-14057a25eacb">Long live Liberapay!</a></p><p>On May 11, 2012, I was sitting in a coffee shop wishing I could work full-time on my open source projects. A lightbulb went off, and three weeks later I launched Gittip, a “tip jar for GitHub” (<a href="https://gratipay.news/gratitude-gratipay-ef24ad5e41f9">renamed</a> two years later).</p><p>The years since have seen all kinds of twists and turns, highs and lows. From an initial constituency of open source developers, our user base expanded to include tech diversity activists. The combination fueled exciting growth, until personality clashes boiled over into the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Gittip_crisis">Gittip Crisis</a>. From there, provocateurs continued to take advantage of Gratipay’s overly welcoming nature, until we had to admit that yes, online communities really do require moderation.</p><p>As luck would have it, we issued our first two user bans right as our close partner Balanced Payments <a href="https://gratipay.news/balancedshutdown-3a9fdb32e9c6">went out of business</a>. That quickly escalated into the <a href="https://gratipay.news/gratipocalypse-42fd0ec0d9e8">Gratipocalypse</a>, resulting in <a href="https://gratipay.news/gratipay-2-0-2453d3c53077">Gratipay 2.0</a> and a fork, <a href="https://liberapay.com/">Liberapay</a>. Gratipay has continued to process payments in the two and a half years since, but at a much-reduced level.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/438/1*-zMdSWTPoIa47xpHpEldFA.png" /></figure><p>Meanwhile, the problem of funding people to work full time on their open source projects has only gained greater urgency. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> led to headlines and the creation of the <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>. Last year’s <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/"><em>Roads and Bridges</em></a> report led to this year’s <a href="https://sustainoss.org/">Sustain</a> conference.</p><p>At Gratipay we’ve spent the past year gearing up to relaunch with a renewed focus on open source. However, funding open source is almost entirely about marketing, and we spent most of the past year writing code instead. File this one under, “open source needs all the skill sets,” but also, “startups need all the skill sets.”</p><p>And now we’re out of runway.</p><p>We intend to continue processing existing weekly payments through the end of the year, which puts the last weekly payment cycle on December 28, 2017.</p><p>If you are currently receiving payments through Gratipay, <em>thank you</em> for your patronage. I’m sorry for the inconvenience of shutting down, for the loss of income this represents for you. I’m sorry that we couldn’t make this work. Fortunately, there are great alternatives in the market now, such as <a href="http://patreon.com/">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://liberapay.com/">Liberapay</a>, and <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a>. If we can do anything to help you move to another platform, please <a href="mailto:support@gratipay.com">get in touch</a>.</p><p>On December 29, 2017, we plan to switch gratipay.com to a static web page. Since it will likely take years to <a href="https://github.com/gratipay/inside.gratipay.com/issues/1205">dispose</a> of unclaimed balances in the proper legal way, it may be a while before we can fully delete our database.</p><p>I’m proud of and humbled by what the Gratipay community has accomplished over the past five and a half years. We moved $1.1 million from dozens of companies to hundreds of open source projects. We pioneered what it means to be an open organization. We tasted the future of work, even if Gratipay won’t be how we get there. We conducted a valuable experiment in cultivating an economy of gratitude, generosity, and love.</p><p>I’m sorry for the mistakes I made. I’m grateful for all of you, and I wish you all the best.</p><p>Thank you.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cbfba8f50981" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://gratipay.news/the-end-cbfba8f50981">The End of Gratipay</a> was originally published in <a href="https://gratipay.news">Gratipay News</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The volunteer open source community creates tremendous value for the global economy but gets <a href="https://gratipay.news/open-source-captures-almost-none-of-the-value-it-creates-9015eb7e293e">almost nothing</a> in return. Yes, by <a href="https://opensource.org/definition">definition</a>, open source software “shall not require a royalty or other fee.” But society needs the open source community to at least be financially solvent, and it’s not. It’s <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">barely surviving</a>.</p><p><strong>How can the open source community keep the lights on?</strong></p><p>The answer is simple: companies need to pay for open source. They benefit the most from the community’s efforts, and they have the most money. Companies do already pay for about half of open source overall, by allowing their employees to work on open source software on company time. They also need to pay for the other half, the half produced by the volunteer open source community.</p><p><strong>How much should companies pay?</strong></p><p>Open source’s royalty-free licensing is a primary reason for using open source in the first place, so we know that companies are not going to foot a trillion dollar bill. Luckily, they don’t have to. Companies pay a premium for the right to direct an employee’s work. By giving up direct control over how the open source community spends its effort, they can realize a significant cost savings. The current discount of 99.98% is too extreme, but companies should be able to pay for the open source community’s labor at a significant discount, while the folks in the community make a modest living working in self-directed collaboration free of employment relationships. It feels like we should be able to make this work.</p><p>One way I like to think about the open source community is as an invisible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies">tech giant</a>. Mårten Mickos, CEO of HackerOne and former CEO of MySQL, puts the size of the open source community at about <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-total-number-of-open-source-developers-out-there-today-Any-reference-or-estimate-appreciated/answer/M%C3%A5rten-Mickos">500,000 people</a>. Since Evan You and approximately three other people are the only ones <a href="https://changelog.com/rfc/12">currently living</a> in a glorious open source future, let’s put the full-time equivalency of those 500,000 people at 5%: that comes out to 25,000 engineers, which is about how many Alphabet has (per SEC <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/">filings</a>). A big theme in open source sustainability is valuing non-code contributions: Alphabet employs about 50,000 non-engineers.</p><p>So if the open source community is a tech giant roughly the size of Alphabet, <strong>how much income does it need in order to sustain itself?</strong></p><p>Alphabet’s revenue is $90B/yr, and their average compensation per person is $187,500/yr (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=average+salary+google">$125,000/yr</a> salary × <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecec.nr0.htm">1.5</a> for benefits). Now, researchers Daniel Kahnemann and Angus Deaton put the threshold of minimum compensation for maximum emotional well-being in the U.S. at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/deaton_kahneman_high_income_improves_evaluation_August2010.pdf">$75,000/yr</a>. Adjusting for inflation, let’s eyeball it that Alphabet pays a 100% markup to direct their employees’ labor. In other words, we could rouse a slumbering open source giant—and secure the future of the open source community we all rely on—for $45B/yr.</p><p><strong>How much should each company pay?</strong></p><p>Companies benefit from open source most directly in their own technical employees’ boosted productivity. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering_demographics">21M</a> employed programmers in the world. To move 25,000 of them into full-time open source work (at a 50% cost savings) and also account for non-technical contributors, each company with their own technical employees should pay the open source community $2,143 per year per technical employee at the company.</p><p>This would work out to maybe <strong>1–3% of total employee compensation</strong> across a range of cases, which seems fair given that open source <a href="https://medium.com/@nayafia/open-source-was-worth-at-least-143m-of-instagram-s-1b-acquisition-808bb85e4681">boosts</a> productivity by 20%.</p><p><strong>How much should <em>your</em> company pay?</strong></p><p>At Gratipay, we believe that companies <em>want</em> to pay for open source, and <em>will</em> pay for open source if it’s easy enough—bureaucratically, technically, and socially.</p><p>Hopefully this post makes it a little easier by helping you decide <em>how much</em> to pay. If you are responsible for your company’s relationship with the open source community, please take it as a starting point for your own internal conversation about how much to pay for open source this year.</p><p>And once you decide, you can <a href="https://gratipay.com/">pay for open source on Gratipay</a>.</p><p><em>Chad Whitacre is the founder of </em><a href="https://gratipay.com/"><em>Gratipay</em></a><em>, a startup that helps companies and others pay for open source.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Open Source Captures 0.02% of the Value it Creates, Leaving $852B/yr on the Table</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0LO2Ld-dsv29q7pPphW2Wg.png" /></figure><p>Two months ago, 100 folks gathered for <a href="https://sustainoss.org/">Sustain</a>, a one-day conversation about open source sustainability (Gratipay was a <a href="https://gratipay.news/sustain-open-source-with-us-5870acdc3ec4">co-organizer</a>). We talked about more than money, but money was definitely on the table. One of the questions left lingering in my mind, though, was <em>how much money</em>?</p><p><strong>How much value is the open source community leaving on the table?</strong></p><p>My understanding from the #sustain channel in the <a href="https://changelog.com/community">Changelog Slack</a> is that the Ford and Sloan foundations are funding research to answer this very question. In the mean time, let’s break out a pencil and napkin, shall we?</p><p><strong>How large is the global economy? The tech sector?</strong></p><p>The global economy is nominally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product">$78T/yr</a>, and tech accounts for <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/16-01-05-global_tech_market_will_continue_to_grow_at_4_5_rates_in_2016_and_2017/">$3T</a> (4%) of that. Since only <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/its-an-open-source-world-78-percent-of-companies-run-open-source-software/">78%</a> of companies use open source, let’s mark those down to $60.8T and $2.3T respectively.</p><p><strong>How much value does open source create?</strong></p><p>Open source increases the value of tech companies by something like <a href="https://medium.com/@nayafia/open-source-was-worth-at-least-143m-of-instagram-s-1b-acquisition-808bb85e4681">21%</a>, so let’s call that $475B of annual value created by open source in tech ($2.3T × 21%). Non-tech companies also use <a href="https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">lots of software</a>; let’s estimate that open source accounts for 2.1% of their value. That’s another $1.2T (($60.8T — $2.3T) × 2.1%). Open source creates $1.7T/yr of value.</p><p><strong>How much value does the open source <em>community</em> create?</strong></p><p>Companies produce <a href="http://dirkriehle.com/2013/08/22/paid-vs-volunteer-work-in-open-source/">half</a> of open source software. The global community of open source volunteers produces the rest, thereby adding $853B of value to the global economy each year.</p><p><strong>How much value does the open source community <em>capture</em>?</strong></p><p>Surveying a <a href="http://flossfoundations.org/foundation-directory">list of open source foundations</a>, I see:</p><ul><li>three with annual revenues above $10M (Linux Foundation and subsidiaries at $90M, Wikimedia at $65M, Mozilla’s non-advertising revenue at $12M),</li><li>maybe a dozen clocking in at around $1M (SFC, FSF, PSF), and</li><li>maybe 100 with annual budgets averaging $100,000 (DSF, OSI).</li></ul><p>Rounding up, the total value captured by the open source community is maybe $200M/yr. Therefore, the open source community captures 0.02% of the value it creates. Conversely, it leaves 99.98% of the value it creates on the table, or about $852B per year.</p><p>Our goal at Gratipay is to help the open source community capture more of the value it creates, by making it both socially and technically easy for your company to pay for open source.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gratipay wants to help your company pay for open source, comprehensively and effectively. A key part of our approach is to link with package managers. Last month, we <a href="https://gratipay.news/integrating-npm-39333109419d">added all 400,000+ npm packages</a> to our catalog, and we made it easier for package maintainers to apply to accept payments.</p><p>Today we shipped two further improvements:</p><ol><li><a href="https://gratipay.com/on/npm/">Upload a </a><a href="https://gratipay.com/on/npm/">package.json</a> to discover packages to give to. This helps you maximize the reach and effectiveness of your open source support, by narrowly targeting the long tail of open source you actually use.</li><li>The 48% of npm package maintainers who maintain more than one package (7% have 10+) can now <a href="https://gratipay.com/on/npm/?flow=receive">apply for all those packages at once</a>.</li></ol><p>Check out both at <a href="https://gratipay.com/on/npm/">https://gratipay.com/on/npm/</a>, and let us know how it goes via <a href="mailto:support@gratipay.com">private email</a> or public <a href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/new?title=npm+feedback">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Gratipay">Twitter</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3h7xIb-UOtVFR09B2dajag.png" /><figcaption>Yes, free as in money. 💸 💃</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks for using Gratipay, and stay tuned for more improvements!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cb07341445ca" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://gratipay.news/pay-for-your-package-json-cb07341445ca">Pay for your package.json</a> was originally published in <a href="https://gratipay.news">Gratipay News</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Towards funding the long tail of open source</h4><p>Gratipay is on a quest to help companies fund the long tail of open source. Without funding, our digital infrastructure <a href="http://fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">crumbles</a>. Heartbleed is the headline, and led to the creation of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII). Three years later, OpenSSL and other projects are stronger, and we are all safer, thanks to the support the industry has shown through CII.</p><p>That said, CII only funded <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/sites/cii/files/cii_annualreport_2016_fnl_digital.pdf">14 projects</a> last year. Libraries.io lists <a href="http://libraries.io/">millions</a> of open source packages, and only covers language ecosystems (no apt or yum). While today’s status quo works well for headline projects, it does not reach the long tail, where most of open source lives. We need <em>all</em> of open source to be healthy, from Linux to left-pad.</p><p>We have more work to do.</p><p>At Gratipay, we think the answer to the problem of funding the long tail of open source is both social and technical. Today, we are taking a technical step forward by integrating the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> package manager directly into Gratipay. In its metadata, npm provides an email address for each package maintainer. Using this email, we’ve made it a little bit easier for package maintainers to apply to use Gratipay to receive funding for their project.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xA4AOnvpGN8WwaQEFhaWxQ.png" /></figure><p>This integration also paves the way for future improvements. Of course, we would like to integrate additional package managers. But the real innovation we’re pursuing is aggregation, because we think that’s going to be important for reaching the long tail. Potential features along the way include:</p><ul><li>pledging to projects that haven’t signed up yet,</li><li>claiming many packages at once, and</li><li>funding all of the projects in your package.json.</li></ul><p>We are also doing a lot of thinking about the <em>social</em> component of helping companies fund the long tail of open source. Stay tuned on that, and <a href="https://gratipay.news/sustain-open-source-with-us-5870acdc3ec4">join us at the Sustain conference</a> next month to be part of the conversation.</p><p>Until then, we invite you to <a href="http://gratipay.com/search">search for your npm packages on Gratipay</a> and apply to join, so that you can receive funding for your open source work!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=39333109419d" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://gratipay.news/integrating-npm-39333109419d">Integrating npm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://gratipay.news">Gratipay News</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gratipay is co-organizing <a href="https://sustainoss.org/">the first SustainOSS conference</a>, to be held at GitHub in San Francisco on June 19. We’re aiming for “a one-day conversation for open source software <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/4/become-open-source-sustainer">sustainers</a>,” a term coined recently by Justin Dorfman to describe people who care deeply about the health of the open source ecosystem.</p><p>The organizers want the event to be participatory without running afoul of the <a href="http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">tyranny of structurelessness</a>, so we invited a highly regarded facilitator, <a href="https://aspirationtech.org/about/people/gunner">Allen “Gunner” Gunn</a>, to guide us. Gunner has asked participants to <a href="https://github.com/sustainers/website/issues/9">start thinking</a> about the narratives we see this event fitting within, and the outcomes we’d like to achieve.</p><p>For my part, I see two narrative arcs to locate this day within, two ongoing culture shifts:</p><ol><li><strong>Evolution of empathy in the firm.</strong> Open source projects create a value vacuum because they give the value first, and <em>then</em> accept payment. This is flipped from the dominant exchange model, where payment precedes value, but it differs from charity because there <em>is</em> a direct value exchange. Making this work requires us to evolve empathy in the firm. Fortunately, developing the capacity to properly value open source suppliers fits into a broader trend pointed to by certified B Corporations <a href="https://blog.etsy.com/news/2012/etsy-joins-the-b-corporation-movement/">like Etsy</a>, and Public Benefit Corporations (PBCs) <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-now-a-benefit-corporation">like Kickstarter</a>. Companies <em>can</em> value more than short-term profit.</li><li><strong>Evolution of open organizations.</strong> When open source projects adopt an economic identity, they become <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization">open organizations</a>. This merging of open source with business — not open source as a commons that other businesses harvest from, but open source projects as themselves a first-class economic entity — requires a new kind of leadership combining both open source and business/startup sensibilities. The <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> is leading the way among flagship projects, while <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> shows promise for smaller projects. <a href="https://gratipay.news/a-platform-cooperative-almost-94cd5900840f">Platform cooperativism</a> suggests some interesting directions here as well.</li></ol><p>The immediate outcome I’d like to see from Sustain is a community and shared identity around the issue of open source sustainability. Docs geeks have <a href="http://www.writethedocs.org/">Write the Docs</a>. Maintainers have <a href="https://maintainerati.org/">Maintainerati</a>. Now sustainers will have <a href="https://sustainoss.org/">Sustain</a>. The larger outcome will be for this new-found community to keep evolving open organizations, and evolving empathy in closed ones.</p><p>Gratipay is excited to participate in Sustain, because these outcomes serve our own <a href="http://inside.gratipay.com/big-picture/mission">mission</a>, to cultivate an economy of gratitude, generosity, and love. <a href="https://opencollective.com/sustainoss/events/2017">Register now</a> to join us in June, and find us in #sustain on the <a href="https://changelog.com/community">Changelog Slack</a> to collaborate in organizing the event.</p><p>Let’s sustain open source! 💸 💃</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5870acdc3ec4" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://gratipay.news/sustain-open-source-with-us-5870acdc3ec4">Sustain Open Source With Us</a> was originally published in <a href="https://gratipay.news">Gratipay News</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Gratipay launched four years ago (we were called Gittip then), recurring crowdfunding — regular donations with a social element — did not exist. Today, there are a number of crowdfunding options, recurrent and otherwise, with several focused specifically on open source. In this post we’re going to take a look at the options. Hopefully it inspires you to make a go of it with your own open source project!</p><p>Let’s start with four recurring crowdfunding platforms focused specifically on open source. They all offer the same basic features and are all about the same size. What differentiates one from another at this point is a) price, and b) openness.</p><p><a href="https://gratipay.com/"><strong>Gratipay</strong></a> — The original (that’s us! :-). We don’t take a cut of payments. Instead, we are funded pay-what-you-want on our own platform, just like the other open source projects on our platform. Furthermore, we practice open hiring and take-what-you-want compensation, so we are truly an <a href="http://inside.gratipay.com/big-picture/welcome">open organization</a>. 💃</p><p><a href="https://liberapay.com/"><strong>Liberapay</strong></a> — Liberapay is a fork of Gratipay. They use the euro instead of the dollar, so they can be better for projects in … Europe! ;-) They aspire to free speech and non-censorship. Like Gratipay, they are funded and distribute revenue on their own platform.</p><p><a href="https://salt.bountysource.com/"><strong>Bountysource Salt</strong></a> — As the name implies, Bountysource worked the issue bounty angle for years, before releasing their monthly recurring product Salt last year. They are a for-profit that takes a 10% cut, and have unfortunately run out of runway. The product is chugging along, but don’t expect to get paid to work on it.</p><p><a href="https://opencollective.com/"><strong>Open Collective</strong></a> — The newest platform on the block, Open Collective has some smart folks behind it. As with Bountysource, they are a VC-backed for-profit company that takes a 10% cut. They also practice traditional hiring and compensation, which means that Open Collective isn’t actually open enough for you to work on.</p><p>Those are the going concerns that are focused on open source. But there are three other more general options that bear mentioning.</p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/"><strong>Patreon</strong></a> — YouTube celeb Jack Conte teamed up with Stanford pal and serial entrepreneur Sam Yam to bring recurring crowdfunding to the consumer market. They focus on YouTube celebs (surprise! ;-) and other artists and digital content creators, but they can also be used for open source projects.</p><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/"><strong>Kickstarter</strong></a> — General purpose crowdfunding sites can be used to fund open source projects. As of this writing, Font Awesome 5 is about to hit $750,000, making them the “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232193852/font-awesome-5">most backed software Kickstarter ever</a>”!</p><p><a href="https://stripe.com/"><strong>Stripe</strong></a> — Of course, you can always roll your own social donations platform using lower-level payment processors. Django is a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/">great example</a>.</p><p>The bottom line is that there are lots of amazing tools available to help you build a sustainable funding base for your open source project. At Gratipay, we think what we’re witnessing is open source projects evolving into fully-fledged open organizations — and we’re thrilled to be a part of the story. Whichever route you take, you’ll be creating more opportunity to work together in the open, which is good news for all of us. Good luck!</p><p><em>Chad Whitacre is the founder of Gratipay.

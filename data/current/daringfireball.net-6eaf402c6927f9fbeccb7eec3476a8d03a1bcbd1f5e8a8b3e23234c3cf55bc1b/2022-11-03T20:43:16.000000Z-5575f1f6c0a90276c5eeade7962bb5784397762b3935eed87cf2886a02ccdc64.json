  "content":"\n<p>Jeff Johnson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I got a feature request from John Gruber, famous for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/\">Daring\nFireball</a>, also famous for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/17/apple-developer-program-license-agreement\">despising the Arial\ntypeface</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Honestly, the most shocking thing about the Apple Developer\nProgram License Agreement is that <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/services-account/agreement/XV2A27GUJ6/content/pdf\">the PDF</a> is entirely\ntypeset in Arial. Clearly it should be San Francisco, but\nHelvetica would be acceptable. Arial should be a firing offense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What you may not know about Gruber, though, is that as much as he\ndespises Arial, he dislikes Courier New even more! If Arial\ndemands firing, then I suppose that Courier New demands… the\nfiring squad? Anyway, Gruber requested that my Safari extension\n<a href=\"https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/\">StopTheMadness</a> add font substitution rules in order to\nreplace all instances of Arial on the web with Helvetica and all\ninstances of Courier New with Courier.</p>\n\n<p>I told Gruber that he didn’t need to wait for me to add the feature,\n  because substituting fonts was already possible in StopTheMadness on\n  both desktop and mobile by using a <a href=\"https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/support-safari.html#custom-elements\">custom <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element</a>\n  containing some <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face\"><code>@font-face</code> rules</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My favorite response to a feature request is always “Actually, you can do that now...”.</p>\n\n<p>It’s such a little thing, and I know most people can’t detect the differences between Helvetica and Arial and don’t care, but it makes me so happy every day never to see the cursed fonts Arial and Courier New.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you prefer, you can substitute the system font — San Francisco — for Arial with the following CSS on the appropriate lines in Johnson’s rules:</p>\n\n<pre><code>src: local(&quot;system-ui&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you’re not using <a href=\"https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/\">StopTheMadness</a>, you’re missing out.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Substitute Web Fonts With StopTheMadness’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/03/substitute-web-fonts-with-stopthemadness\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

  "content":"\n<p>Casey Newton and Zoë Schiffer, reporting for Platformer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Musk’s whim-based approach to product development, his rapidly depleting executive ranks, and the very real likelihood of hundreds or even thousands of additional departures at the company in coming weeks threaten to leave Twitter a shadow of its former self.

Placing the factory under a\n“static management” policy, a euphemism for total lockdown, also\ncomes a day after reports that Foxconn plans to decrease\nproduction at the facility over the coming months.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-zone-that-hosts-foxconns-zhengzhou-plant-imposes-fresh-lockdown-2022-11-02/\">Reuters</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>China ordered an industrial park that houses an iPhone factory\nbelonging to Foxconn to enter a seven-day lockdown on Wednesday,\nin a move set to intensify pressure on the Apple supplier as it\nscrambles to quell worker discontent at the base. The Zhengzhou\nAirport Economy Zone in central China said it would impose “silent\nmanagement” measures with immediate effect, including barring all\nresidents from going out and only allowing approved vehicles on\nroads within that area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t have much to say about this other than that it feels like a situation worth keeping an eye on.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Factory Run by Foxconn Placed Under Total COVID Lockdown in China’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/02/foxconn-factory-lockdown\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

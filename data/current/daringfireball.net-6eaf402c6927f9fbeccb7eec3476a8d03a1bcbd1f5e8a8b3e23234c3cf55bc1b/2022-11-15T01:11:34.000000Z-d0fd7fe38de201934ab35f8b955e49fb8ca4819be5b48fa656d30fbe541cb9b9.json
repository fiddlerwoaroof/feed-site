  "content":"\n<p>My thanks once again to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Kolide is an endpoint security solution for Mac, Windows, and Linux devices. Kolide gives IT admins a single dashboard, through which you can prove that your fleet has the security measures in place that auditors care about. With Kolide, you can instantly see whether:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Firewalls and screen lock are enabled.</li>\n<li>Operating systems are up to date.</li>\n<li>Password managers are installed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Kolide also provides visibility into nuanced issues that MDMs can’t address, like whether developers have unencrypted SSH keys or plaintext 2FA backup codes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3yL3FcB\">Try Kolide for 14 days free of charge, with no credit card required</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Kolide’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/14/kolide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

  "content":"\n<p>My thanks to Mux for sponsoring last week at DF. Mux Video is an API to powerful video streaming (think of it like Stripe for video), built by the founders of Zencoder and creators of Video.js, and a team of ex-YouTube and Twitch engineers. Take any video file or live stream and make it play beautifully, at scale, on any device, powered by magical-feeling features like automatic thumbnails, animated GIFs, and data-driven encoding decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Spend your time building what people want, not drudging through <code>ffmpeg</code> documentation.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Mux Video’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/22/mux-video\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

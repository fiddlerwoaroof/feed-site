  "content":"\n<p>Blake Buettner, writing for Worn &amp; Wound:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a surprising move this morning Rolex, along with\nfilmmaker/adventurer extraordinaire James Cameron, revealed a new\nDeepsea Challenge in the reference 126067. Rolex enthusiasts will\nimmediately notice something new about that number, and that’s the\n7 at the very end. That last digit denotes the case material, and\nuntil now a 7 has never been used. That’s because this watch\nrepresents the first commercially available Rolex crafted from\ntitanium. That may be a first, but this really a reference that\ncelebrates the past in a way rarely seen from the brand. That\nsaid, the most exciting details of this watch are what it might\nsay about future releases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The two most interesting new watches of the year, to me, are both exclusively made with titanium cases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIx852sLRM\">This video with James Cameron</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Rolex’s First Titanium Watch’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/01/rolex-titanium\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

  "content":"\n<p>Yang Jie, Stephanie Yang, and Yoko Kubota, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AwRLL4bWeQLWljV6PVVxUww\">News+</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to increase the prices of its most advanced chips by roughly 10%, while less advanced chips used by customers like auto makers will cost about 20% more, these people said. The higher prices will generally take effect late this year or next year, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Inc. is one of TSMC’s largest customers and its iPhones use advanced microprocessors made in TSMC foundries. It couldn’t be determined how much more Apple would pay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not just iPhones: TSMC manufactures all “Apple silicon”. And no one else can make them. Really, this is just Econ 101: demand for TSMC chips is high, supply is constrained, so prices are going up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/mikeysan/status/1431356011508494337\">Compelling alternative theory</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘TSMC to Raise Chip Prices by 10–20 Percent’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/29/tsmc-prices\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

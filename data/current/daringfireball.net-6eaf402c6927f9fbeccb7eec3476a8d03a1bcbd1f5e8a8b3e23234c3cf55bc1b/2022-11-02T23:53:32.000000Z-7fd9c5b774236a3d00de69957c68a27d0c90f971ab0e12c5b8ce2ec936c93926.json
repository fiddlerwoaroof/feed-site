  "content":"\n<p>Elisa Lipsky-Karasz, writing for the WSJ:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the first employees hired by Ive was a full-time writer.\n(There are now more than 30 employees, many of whom worked with\nhim at Apple.) Ive says LoveFrom is the only creative practice he\nknows of to have an on-staff scribe whose job is, in part, to help\nconjure into words the ideas that his team of graphic designers,\narchitects, sound engineers and industrial designers come up with\nfor its collaborations with Airbnb, Ferrari and others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting profile, but only insofar as I think it would be nearly impossible to write a profile of Ive that wasn’t interesting to some degree.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Jony Ive on Life After Apple’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/02/ive-after-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

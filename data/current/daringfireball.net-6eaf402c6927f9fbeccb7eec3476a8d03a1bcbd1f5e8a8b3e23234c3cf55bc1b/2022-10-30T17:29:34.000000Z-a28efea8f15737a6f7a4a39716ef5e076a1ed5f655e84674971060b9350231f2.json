  "content":"\n<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring Daring Fireball last week. Kolide is an endpoint security solution that gives IT teams a single dashboard for all devices, regardless of their operating system.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re a small company dominated by engineers, you can keep up with fleet management with nothing more than trust and a spreadsheet. But once you start to hire marketers, designers, and the rest, the number of laptops balloons and the line between “work” and “personal” devices gets fuzzy. But fuzzy isn’t going to cut it. You have to prove you’ve got device security under control to close deals with customers, <a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3NUh8mG\">pass a third-party audit</a>, and prove you’re ready for acquisition or an IPO.</p>\n\n<p>Kolide can answer questions MDMs can’t:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do you have production data being stored on devices?</li>\n<li>Are all your developers’ SSH keys encrypted?</li>\n<li>And a host of other data points you’d otherwise have to write a custom shell script to learn about.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Want to see how it works for yourself? <a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3c0AF7W\">Kolide is offering DF readers a free trial</a>, no credit card required.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Kolide’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/30/kolide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

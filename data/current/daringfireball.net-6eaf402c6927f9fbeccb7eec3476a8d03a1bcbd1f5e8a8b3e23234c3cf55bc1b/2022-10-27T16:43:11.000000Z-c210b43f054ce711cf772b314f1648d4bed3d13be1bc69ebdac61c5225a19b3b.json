  "content":"\n<p>The bit that’s getting <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/apple-confirms-iphone-to-get-usb-c-charging-to-comply-with-eu-law.html\">all</a> the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423977/iphone-usb-c-eu-law-joswiak-confirms-compliance-lightning\">attention</a> is Joz’s “Obviously we’ll have to comply” remark about EU regulations mandating a USB-C port on phones starting at the end of 2024. I encourage you to make time to watch the whole interview — it’s really good, and it’s only 35 minutes long. But if you only watch one bit, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1585253746375737344\">watch Joz’s two-minute answer to that question</a>. It’s far more nuanced than just “Obviously we’ll have to comply.”</p>\n\n<p>(Also worth enjoying Federighi’s subtle chuckle at the question, because he knows answering that one is Joz’s problem.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ugwoEOMvg\">Now available on YouTube</a>, too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Joanna Stern Interviews Federighi and Joz at WSJ Tech Live’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/26/stern-federighi-joz\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

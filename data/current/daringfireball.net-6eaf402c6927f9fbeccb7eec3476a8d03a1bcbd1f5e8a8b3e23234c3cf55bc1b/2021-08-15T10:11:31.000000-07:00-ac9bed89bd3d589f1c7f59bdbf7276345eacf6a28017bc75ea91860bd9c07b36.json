  "content":"\n<p>My thanks to Retool for sponsoring last week at DF. Retool is a new approach to programming for the modern web: they’ve unified the ease of visual programming with the power and flexibility of real code. Drag and drop a form together, and have it <code>POST</code> back to your API in minutes. Deploy instantly with access controls and audit logs. It’s akin to a HyperCard or Visual Basic for the modern web.</p>\n\n<p>Allbirds uses Retool to measure billboard efficacy. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. You, too, can use it to build business-critical applications fast.</p>\n\n<p>Check out their demo video to see how easy it is to build something serious and useful, quickly and intuitively. <a href=\"https://retool.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=daringfireball\">Start building for free today</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Retool’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/15/retool\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

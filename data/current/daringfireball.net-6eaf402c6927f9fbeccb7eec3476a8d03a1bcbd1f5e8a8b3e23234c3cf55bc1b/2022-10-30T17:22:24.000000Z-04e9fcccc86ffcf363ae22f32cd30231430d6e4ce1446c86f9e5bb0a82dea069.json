  "content":"\n<p>David Frum:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But if both Republicans and Democrats, left and right, <em>suffer</em>\npolitical violence, the same cannot be said of those who\n<em>celebrate</em> political violence. That’s not a “both sides” affair\nin 2020s America.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t see Democratic House members wielding weapons in videos\nand threatening to shoot candidates who want to cut capital-gains\ntaxes or slow the growth of Medicare. Democratic candidates for\nSenate do not post video fantasies of hunting and executing\npolitical rivals, or of using a firearm to discipline their\nchildren’s romantic partners. It’s not because of Democratic\nmembers that Speaker Nancy Pelosi\n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/06/17/pelosi-says-house-metal-detectors-will-remain-indefinitely/\">installed</a>\nmetal detectors to bar firearms from the floor of the House. No\nDemocratic equivalent exists of Donald Trump, who regularly\npraises and encourages violence as a normal tool of politics, most\nrecently against his own party’s Senate leader, Mitch McConnell.\nAs the formerly Trump-leaning Wall Street Journal\n<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-death-wish-rhetoric-mitch-mcconnell-elaine-chao-truth-social-violence-donald-11664735710\">editorialized</a>\non October 2: “It’s all too easy to imagine some fanatic taking\nMr. Trump seriously and literally, and attempting to kill Mr.\nMcConnell. Many supporters took Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about former\nVice President <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/mike-pence\">Mike\nPence</a> all too\nseriously on Jan. 6.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘Only the GOP Celebrates Political Violence’’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/30/gop-political-violence\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

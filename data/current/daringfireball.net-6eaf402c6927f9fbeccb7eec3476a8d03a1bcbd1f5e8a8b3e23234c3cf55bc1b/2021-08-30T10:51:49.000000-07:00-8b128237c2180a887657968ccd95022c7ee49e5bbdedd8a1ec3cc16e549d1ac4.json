  "content":"\n<p>Michiko Kakutani, writing for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1960, while working as an artist and graphic designer, and some\nyears before the Rolling Stones were born, Charlie Watts began\nwork on “Ode to a High-Flying Bird,” a <a href=\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/charlie-watts-tribute-to-bird/\">captivating children’s\nbook about his hero, the jazz great Charlie Parker</a>. The book\nfeatured charming drawings of a bird named Charlie who realized he\ndidn’t sound like most of the other birds, and who left home to\nfly to New York City, where he played “from his heart” and made a\nnew nest for himself in “Birdland.”</p>\n\n<p>Charlie Parker made a 14-year-old Charlie Watts dream the\nimpossible dream of visiting New York and playing at a jazz club.\nAnd while he thought at the time that “the only way to get to New\nYork was in a band on a cruise ship,” he would actually get there\nin 1964 with the Rolling Stones. While Keith Richards and Mick\nJagger hung out at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/nyregion/28apollo.html\">the Apollo</a>, where James Brown was doing\nfive — five! — shows a day, Mr. Watts spent his free time\nhaunting the jazz clubs he’d dreamed about as a boy: He saw\nCharles Mingus at Birdland, Gene Krupa at the Metropole, and Sonny\nRollins, Earl Hines and Miles Davis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lovely memorial, with some great quotes from his bandmates.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘When Charlie Watts Finally Made It to New York City’’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/30/watts-made-it-to-nyc\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

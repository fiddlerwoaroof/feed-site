  "content":"\n<p>More on the thinking behind Glass:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Om:</strong> <em>Tom, tell us a bit about yourself and what prompted you to\nstart Glass.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tom Watson:</strong> I’ve been designing digital products for over 20\nyears now. I was an early Product Designer at Facebook (2009-2013)\nand Pinterest (2013-2018). I saw the tradeoffs firsthand around\nhaving to design for engagement versus people using the product.\nThat experience made me want to build something different. […]</p>\n\n<p>We intentionally didn’t raise venture capital. We didn’t want to\nmake the compromises that I saw earlier in my career. With no\noutside capital and subscriptions, we’re able to forgo\nadvertising, engagement algorithms, pivots to video, and several\nother things we feel would compromise the product and community\nwe’re trying to build.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Om:</strong> <em>Who are you focused on as a primary customer — a professional\nphotographer? A pro-am photographer? Or amateurs?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>TW:</strong> It’s for photographers — amateur or professional. That can be\nanything from someone just starting with their iPhone or someone\nwith tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. We believe\ngreat photography can come from anywhere and anyone. We hope to\nbuild a community for all levels of photographers to learn, grow,\nand generally nerd out about photography.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Om Malik Interviews Glass Co-Founder Tom Watson’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/13/om-malik-glass-tom-watson\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

  "content":"\n<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Kolide is endpoint security and fleet management that takes a different approach from draconian MDMs. They help customers meet their compliance goals — whether for auditors, customers, or leadership — by enlisting the support of end users. Kolide works by notifying your employees of security issues via Slack, educating them on why these issues are important, and giving them step-by-step instructions to resolve them themselves.</p>\n\n<p>For IT admins, Kolide helps you prove compliance via a single dashboard. From there, you can monitor the security of your entire fleet, whether they’re running on Mac, Windows, or Linux. (That’s right: Kolide can <a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3PadCFV\">finally provide visibility into your Linux users</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3yPxU2f\">Sign up for a free trial with no credit card required</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Kolide’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/24/kolide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

  "content":"\n<p>My thanks to Atoms for sponsoring last week at DF. I’m wearing Atoms right now, as I type this. They’re some of my favorite shoes I’ve ever owned. Atoms designed its Model 000 to be the shoe you’d want to wear every day. Thanks to their comfort and simplicity, they can become your go-to sneaker, and work with just about any outfit.</p>\n\n<p>This holiday, Atoms is bringing back some of its popular limited edition colors. Daring Fireball readers get 15% off all Model 000 colors. Take advantage of the opportunity to stock up for the holidays. Just use code DARING at checkout.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Atoms’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/07/atoms\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

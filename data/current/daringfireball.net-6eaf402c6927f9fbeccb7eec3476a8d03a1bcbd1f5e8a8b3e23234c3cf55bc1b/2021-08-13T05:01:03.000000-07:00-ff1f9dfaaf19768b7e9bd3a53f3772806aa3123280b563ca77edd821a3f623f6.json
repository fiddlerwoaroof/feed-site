  "content":"\n<p>The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>San Francisco leaders on Thursday unveiled some of the nation’s\ntoughest restrictions on unvaccinated people, barring them from\nindoor dining, bars, nightclubs, gyms, large concerts, theaters\nand other events held inside. The new rules, which take effect on\nAug. 20, would apply even to people who can show they have tested\nnegative for the coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>“This is an important step towards our recovery,” Mayor London\nBreed said during a briefing announcing the new requirements. “We\nall have to do our part. We need to get vaccinated.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More like this, please.</p>\n\n<p>Philadelphia re-instituted an indoor mask mandate starting today; I hope we follow New York and San Fran with a full-on “vaccinated or stay the fuck home” mandate.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘San Francisco Announces Strict Indoor Vaccine Mandate’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/12/san-fran-mandate\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

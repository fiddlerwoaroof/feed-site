  "content":"\n<p>Bill Cheeseman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>UI Browser 3 reached its end of life and was retired on October\n17, 2022. It can no longer be purchased. The last release of UI\nBrowser, version 3.0.2, will not be updated, and support is no\nlonger available. Owners of an existing license for UI Browser can\ncontinue to download the <a href=\"https://latenightsw.com/freeware/ui-browser/\">UI Browser 3.0.2</a> disk image from\nLate Night Software’s Freeware website. It will remain available\nfor a limited time. [...]</p>\n\n<p>UI Browser 4 is now available for development as a public <a href=\"https://github.com/alldritt/UIBrowser4\">GitHub\nopen source project</a>, and it is open for discussion on the\n<a href=\"https://forum.latenightsw.com/c/uibrowser/\">UI Browser Discussion page</a> of the Late Night Software\nForum. It is written in Swift. As initially posted, it is only\nminimally functional and requires much more work to become useful.\n(While many of the code files refer to UI Browser 3, they are in\nfact all part of UI Browser 4. Although they display a copyright\nnotice, Bill Cheeseman and PFiddlesoft hereby dedicate them to the\npublic domain.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You may recall <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/04/27/cheeseman-ui-browser\">my post from back in April</a>, when Cheeseman first announced his and UI Browser’s retirement, singing UI Browser’s praises. UI Browser is truly an astonishing utility, and I’m hopeful it now has a future.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘UI Browser’s Future’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/01/ui-browser-future\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

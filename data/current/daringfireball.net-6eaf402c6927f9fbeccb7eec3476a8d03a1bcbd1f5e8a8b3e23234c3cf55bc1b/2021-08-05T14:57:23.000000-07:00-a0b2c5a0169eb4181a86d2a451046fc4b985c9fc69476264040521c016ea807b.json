  "content":"\n<p>Ted Johnson, reporting for Deadline:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CNN head Jeff Zucker said that the network has fired three\nemployees for going into the office without being vaccinated\nagainst Covid-19, and that parent WarnerMedia may ultimately\nrequire proof of the shots. […]</p>\n\n<p>“In the past week, we have been made aware of three employees who\nwere coming to the office unvaccinated,” Zucker wrote in an email\nto staff. “All three have been terminated. Let me be clear — we\nhave a zero-tolerance policy on this. You need to be vaccinated to\ncome to the office. And you need to be vaccinated to work in the\nfield, with other employees, regardless of whether you enter an\noffice or not. Period. We expect that in the weeks ahead, showing\nproof of vaccination may become a formal part of the WarnerMedia\nPasscard process. Regardless, our expectations remain in place.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More like this, please.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘CNN Fires Three Employees for Going Into Office Without Vaccinations’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/05/cnn-fires-three-unvaccinated-employees\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

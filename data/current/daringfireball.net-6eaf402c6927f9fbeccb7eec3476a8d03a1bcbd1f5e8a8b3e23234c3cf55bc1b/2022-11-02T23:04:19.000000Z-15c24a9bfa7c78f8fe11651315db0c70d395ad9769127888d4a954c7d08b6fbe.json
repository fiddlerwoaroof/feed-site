  "content":"\n<p>Sebastiaan de With, writing for the Lux blog (the makers of Halide):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I took the iPhone 14 Pro on a trip around San Francisco and\nNorthern California, to the remote Himalayas and mountains of the\nKingdom of Bhutan, and Tokyo — to test every aspect of its\nimage-making, and I have to say that I was pretty blown away by\nthe results of the main camera.</p>\n\n<p>While arguably, a quad-bayer sensor should not give true\n48-megapixel sensor resolution as one might get from, say, a\ncomparable ‘proper’ digital camera, the results out of the iPhone\n14 Pro gave me chills. I have simply never gotten image quality\nlike this out of a phone. There’s more here than just resolution;\nthe way the new 48 megapixel sensor renders the image is unique\nand simply tremendously different than what I’ve seen before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Inspiring and informative.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘iPhone 14 Pro Camera Review: A Small Step, a Huge Leap — Lux’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/02/lux-iphone-14-pro-camera-review\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

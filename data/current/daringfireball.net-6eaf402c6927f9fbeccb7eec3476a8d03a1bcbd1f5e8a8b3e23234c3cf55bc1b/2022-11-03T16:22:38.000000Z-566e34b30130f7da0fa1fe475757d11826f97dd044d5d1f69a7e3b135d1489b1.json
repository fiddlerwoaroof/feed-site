  "content":"\n<p>Felix Krause, back in September:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-instagram-and-facebook-can-track-anything-you-do-on-any-website-in-their-in-app-browser\">Last week I published a report</a> on the risks of mobile apps\nusing in-app browsers. Some apps, like Instagram and Facebook,\ninject JavaScript code into third party websites that cause\npotential security and privacy risks to the user.</p>\n\n<p>I was so happy to see the article featured by major media outlets\nacross the globe, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/11/meta-injecting-code-into-websites-visited-by-its-users-to-track-them-research-says\">TheGuardian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/12/meta_ios_privacy/\">The\nRegister</a>, generated a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KrauseFx/status/1557412468368052225\">over a million impressions on\nTwitter</a>, and was ranked <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32415470\">#1 on HackerNews</a> for more\nthan 12 hours. After reading through the replies and DMs, I saw a\ncommon question across the community:</p>\n\n<p><em>“How can I verify what apps do in their webviews?”</em></p>\n\n<p>Introducing <a href=\"https://inappbrowser.com/\">InAppBrowser.com</a>, a simple tool to list the\nJavaScript commands executed by the iOS app rendering the page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s pretty creepy that TikTok both injects a JavaScript keylogger <em>and</em> does not have a button to open the current page in Safari.</p>\n\n<p>I understand why in-app browsers are a thing on iOS (and iPadOS) but not on MacOS, but when you really think about it, it’s quite strange, and a vestige of the past when multitasking on iOS was so much more limited. Whenever possible, open links in Safari (or whatever your default browser is).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘InAppBrowser.com: See What JavaScript Commands Get Injected Through an in-App Browser’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/03/in-app-browsers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

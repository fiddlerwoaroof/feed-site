As of August, 68 percent of district employees have been fully vaccinated, according to self-reported district data. Among teachers, that rate is higher, with 82 percent reporting that they are fully vaccinated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More like this, please.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Chicago Public School Teachers and Staff Must Be Vaccinated by October 15 or Stay Home’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/13/chicago-teacher-mandate\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I got a call from one of our younger engineers today complaining that their shiny new 3D printer wasn't talking to their workstation.</p> <p>Me: &quot;Okay, what's the message you're getting when you try to connect?&quot;</p> <p>Eng: &quot;It's saying that the C O M port&quot; (pronouncing it See Oh Emm) &quot;is not responding. What's a C O M port? It's plugged into the front USB&quot;</p> <p>Me: &quot;Oh, er, right&quot;</p> <p>(scratching my head while trying to remember the last time I had to configure a serial port on Windows while also feeling old)</p> <p>Me: &quot;do you know what baud rate the printer is expecting?&quot;</p> <p>Eng: &quot;is that like the rate of extrusion?&quot;</p> <p>Me: &quot;...I think it'd be easier if I come down there and take a look&quot;</p> <p>Took a walk down, set the serial port to 115200 baud 8N1 with no flow control and the printer responded. Lucky guess.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mattthepianoman\"> /u/mattthepianoman </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yvdm8a/whats_a_com_port/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yvdm8a/whats_a_com_port/\">[comments]</a></span>"

  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I useed to work for an ISP in the NOC, monitoring its national and international networks. </p> <p>I had been there for a few months when winter hits, and we notice a edge node going offline for a week, comming back up for a while and then going offline again. This happens multiple times that winter, and we just follow protocol and alert the nearest technician. </p> <p>So one stormy winter night my curiosity got the better of me when reporting yet again that said node was down. I asked what is it with this node?<br> I then got the surprising answer that this node was located on a small island of &gt;100ppl, poorly placed on the docks, so that when the winter storms hit the waves would spray over it, and the seaspray would then cause a ground fault tripping the GFI. All that was needed was for the tech to travel the few hours by boat, and reset the GFI.....<br> Moving that node just a bit up the road, away from the water would fix the issue. Should have been raised as an issue in planning the node!<br> This is what happens when engineers and designers does not work on fixing things.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Active-Vermicelli-31\"> /u/Active-Vermicelli-31 </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yv56ym/node_down/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yv56ym/node_down/\">[comments]</a></span>"

  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When i entered the First Level Support in our company, I was a career changer and fairly new to tech stuff. (6 years ago)</p> <p>So, the following call happened on one of my first days there:</p> <p>User:&quot;Hello, my keyboard doesn't work&quot;</p> <p>Me:&quot;Ok, like, what does or does it not do?&quot;</p> <p>User:&quot;So, when i press F it does H, when i press P it does 7 and other weird things&quot;</p> <p>So newby me had no actual idea what was going on and to cover up my insecurity i laughingly said:&quot;Did you by ANY CHANCE pour coffee on your keyboard this morning?&quot;</p> <p>Silence. Like, DEAD silence. After a while, the user whispered, with fear in her voice:&quot;How did you know????&quot;She was actually scared.</p> <p>I learned a lot from this call, like never trust users.</p> <p>And this is fellow techies, how i lost my tech-support-virginity.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Loxtus\"> /u/Loxtus </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ypuucf/how_i_lost_my_techsupportvirginity/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ypuucf/how_i_lost_my_techsupportvirginity/\">[comments]</a></span>"

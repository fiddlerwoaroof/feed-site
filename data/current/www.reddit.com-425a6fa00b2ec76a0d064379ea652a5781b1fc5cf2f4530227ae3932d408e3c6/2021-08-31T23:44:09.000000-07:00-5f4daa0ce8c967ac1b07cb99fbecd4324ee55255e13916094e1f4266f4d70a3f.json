  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I don’t know if I deserve to post here,I don’t work tech support, I’m just a computer science major, that wants to learn more about computers and stuff so I try to help where I can, I also recently rebirthed an old computer (of mine) with Linux, I’m not great at this stuff, but hey the way to improve is practice</p> <p>So the projector was frozen on the first side of a power point</p> <p>I start by assuming the projector is a second monitors, I’ve had minor issues with a second monitor on the past, turns out the projector has the same signal, so they are both the same monitor, kind of like how two keyboards are treated</p> <p>I then tried to check the physical connections, and I thought I found the issue, there was a big wire that just wasn’t plugged in, I tried to figure out what it was, and asked the professor eventually (couldn’t at first, she was talking to the class while I was fixing it) as it turns out she has never seen that wire before, so I looked around, I then noticed it was plugged into something with a tag that says “laptop” which has a switch turned to “desktop” and a desktop is plugged in</p> <p>Turns out that’s incase you want a laptop to be plugged in, but you don’t have to unplug the main computer (teachers often teach in different rooms, so maybe it’s so they can avoid messing with a cool-workers set up)</p> <p>So I decided to check the projector settings, grab the remote, and then just start cracking up Right below the main controls, I’m an easy place to accidentally press there’s a big button that says “freeze”</p> <p>I press it, and suddenly it works</p> <p>I just continue laughing, and just show three teacher/class that there was a freeze button, one or two laugh a small amount,I was probably the only person am really found it funny (I was also the only one who spent 30 minutes on the problem)</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mission-Guard5348\"> /u/Mission-Guard5348 </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pfobwi/apparently_projectors_have_a_freeze_button/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pfobwi/apparently_projectors_have_a_freeze_button/\">[comments]</a></span>"

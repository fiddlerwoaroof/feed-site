  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I do consumer tech support. Recently I had a very long call about a customer’s elderly computer. Their display was showing two windows!</p> <p>Tried to remote in. No joy. Checked for documentation of what I understood to be the issue based on the customer’s responses to my questions. No luck.</p> <p>After about 40 minutes I realized that the customer’s operating system had gone through an automatic update and wiped the customer’s customized display, including the desktop photo and programs they left open, and it was that which prompted the call. </p> <p>15 minutes later I was able to guide them back to the way the computer looked before the update….</p> <p>Our target time is less than 30 minutes per call. Hopefully I get some short snappers in the next couple of weeks!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xforce2000\"> /u/xforce2000 </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pbe2qz/duh_oh_that_is_what_you_meant/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pbe2qz/duh_oh_that_is_what_you_meant/\">[comments]</a></span>"

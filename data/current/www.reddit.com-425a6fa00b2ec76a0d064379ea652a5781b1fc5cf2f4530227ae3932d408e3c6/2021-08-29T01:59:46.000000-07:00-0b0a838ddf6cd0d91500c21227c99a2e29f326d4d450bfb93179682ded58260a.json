  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So, I used to work in Tech Support for a private business handling calls/emails from a UK government agency. I only lasted 3 weeks…somehow receiving emails demanding a new SatNav “for Health &amp; Safety reasons” and “I don’t have to send you an email to authenticate because of who I am” had me looking elsewhere. Today’s story was a call that my buddy took (I was listening in to learn) and he was rapidly looking perplexed. The lady in question said she couldn’t log in to her laptop. No matter what she did the little stars didn’t appear. Now the laptops didn’t have a docking station for when at home, but did come with a monitor, port replicator and keyboard/mouse. In a moment of clarity I asked my buddy if I could unmute and takeover… Me “Hello, could you tell me if you’re typing using the wireless keyboard supplied?” Her “Yes, nothing’s happening” Me “Could you remove the keyboard dongle from the laptop, this will disconnect the wireless keyboard and then use the laptops own keyboard to enter your password” The well-known Windows bu-bum of USB device being removed followed by key presses followed by a heavier hand jabbing uncontrollably at the keyboard. Her “nothing, nothing at all!” Me “have you just tried logging into the laptop using the wireless keyboard you just disconnected?” Her, without a pause, “yes”…longer pause…”oh…it’s working now”</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Radarman2\"> /u/Radarman2 </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pdrw6s/i_cant_log_in/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pdrw6s/i_cant_log_in/\">[comments]</a></span>"

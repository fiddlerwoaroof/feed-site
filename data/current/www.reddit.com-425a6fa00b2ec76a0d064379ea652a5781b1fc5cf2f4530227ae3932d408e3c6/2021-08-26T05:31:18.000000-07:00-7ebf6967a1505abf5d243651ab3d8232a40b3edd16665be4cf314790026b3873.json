  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Caller: I'm looking in my outlook and a bunch of my emails are missing. </p> <p>Me: Ok, I'm looking at your Outlook data file and it's really really large. As that file grows larger and larger the chances for corruption increase. Short term we can scan and repair it. For a long term fix I recommend archiving old email to reduce the size of that PST file. Remember...we talk about this about once a year and you say you hate archiving and you never want to do it because you lose emails? </p> <p>Caller: We've never talked about this before. </p> <p>Me: Yep, every time you have an Outlook problem. </p> <p>Caller: Well can you tell me how to archive my old email? </p> <p>Me: Do you still have the notes I asked you to take last time? </p> <p>Caller: YOU HAVE NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS!</p> <p>Me: I have....repeatedly....for years. I'll be happy to step you through the process but please take notes so you can refer to them in the future. </p> <p>Caller: Forget it! I'll just figure it out on my own!</p> <p>Me: I wouldn't recommend that, there are some default settings you have to change otherwise Outlook will slow WAY down. </p> <p>Caller: I'll figure it out! --Click--</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DebbyRubottom53\"> /u/DebbyRubottom53 </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pbyjis/i_love_it_when_they_threaten_to_figure_it_out_for/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pbyjis/i_love_it_when_they_threaten_to_figure_it_out_for/\">[comments]</a></span>"

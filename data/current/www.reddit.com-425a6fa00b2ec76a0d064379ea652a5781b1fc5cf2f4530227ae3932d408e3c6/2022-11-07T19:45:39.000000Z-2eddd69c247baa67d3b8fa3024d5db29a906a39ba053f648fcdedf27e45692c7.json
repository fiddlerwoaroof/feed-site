  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I work in TV post production so while it’s not a traditional tech job it’s very tech heavy and when there’s an issue my position is usually the first port of call for clients.</p> <p>A colleague of mine did an export a few days ago for a client who since flagged it as having a “weird end frame”. I didn’t see the original export they were sent, but when I played back the sequence in the editing software nothing looked weird, so I went ahead and exported it again and sent it to the client.</p> <p>The client got back to me shortly after saying there was still an issue with the end frame and sent me a screenshot of the text that’s not on the last frame but the last thing seen before it fades to black.</p> <p>They say that the curved letters still aren’t smooth.</p> <p>I checked it back against the sequence I was told to export, and what I assume the original sequence was. They all look the same and nothing looks different at all.</p> <p>All but two of the letters in the text they flagged consisted of straight lines, it was just the two curved ones they had an issue with, D and S.</p> <p>This client was complaining about the roundness, or lack there of, of pixels.</p> <p>That’s just how round letters look when they’re made of squares mate….</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Emderth\"> /u/Emderth </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yoy1ld/the_roundness_of_pixels/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yoy1ld/the_roundness_of_pixels/\">[comments]</a></span>"

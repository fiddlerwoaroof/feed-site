It was just a frozen session, it just happens sometimes. There's nothing you can do to prevent it.

You know what's coming.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pyroguyFTW\"> /u/pyroguyFTW </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yvipj3/its_winter_my_peoples/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yvipj3/its_winter_my_peoples/\">[comments]</a></span>"

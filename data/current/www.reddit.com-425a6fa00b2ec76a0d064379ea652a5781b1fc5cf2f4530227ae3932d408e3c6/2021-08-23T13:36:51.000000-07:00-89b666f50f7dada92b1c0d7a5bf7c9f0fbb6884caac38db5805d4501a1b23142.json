  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I'm an IT Director of a medium sized business, have been pushing cybersecurity training for the users for several years now. Some of the users are so paranoid about opening emails, they forward the emails to me for confirmation first. I usually tell them to trust their judgment (after I check to make sure it was safe).</p> <p>But today a salesperson forwarded an email he thinks was a customer sending him pics of something but was not sure. It took about 10 seconds for me to realize he forwarded a text he received to his email and forgot he did it. The email came from &lt;phone#&gt;@mms.att.net and he didn't notice the number was his own.</p> <p>I'm glad he is careful, but maybe I scared them a bit too much about phishing.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ulimi2002\"> /u/ulimi2002 </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pa8ail/too_much_training/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pa8ail/too_much_training/\">[comments]</a></span>"

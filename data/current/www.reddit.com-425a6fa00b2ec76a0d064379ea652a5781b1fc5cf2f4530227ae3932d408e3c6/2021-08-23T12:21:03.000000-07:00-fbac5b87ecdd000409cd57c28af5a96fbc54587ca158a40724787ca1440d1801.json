While I don't plan to stick around at the current place I do get to put food on my table in the interim. Anyway, you know how you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat the help? Well, it turns out that I am both the help and an idiot magnet so I'm learning a lot about people today!</p> <p>I had barely exited my vehicle when Mal Content, the local blowhard, descended down the steps towards me.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Mal:</strong> &quot;Why didn't you fix my computer?&quot;</p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> &quot;Because I didn't know there was anything wrong with it...?&quot;</p> <p><strong>Mal:</strong> &quot;It won't turn on and I need to do <em>important</em> work, so I had to troubleshoot it myself. I know it's not the [tower] because I pushed the power button and nothing happened.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> &quot;Nothing at all?&quot;</p> <p><strong>Mal:</strong> &quot;Nothing. Just some lights and a bit of noise, and then <em>nothing</em>. I can't believe you didn't fix this! You were supposed to fix this yesterday!&quot;</p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>sigh</em> &quot;All right, I'll take a look.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>And so with Mal breathing down my neck, I pressed the power button on the tower.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Mal:</strong> &quot;See?! Nothing! I told you the [tower] was broken!&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>And then I pressed the power button on the monitor...</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Mal:</strong> &quot;What?! What did you just do?&quot; </p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> &quot;Magic.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Sometimes, just sometimes, you win.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YDAQ\"> /u/YDAQ </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pa6trp/i_just_turned_it_on/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pa6trp/i_just_turned_it_on/\">[comments]</a></span>"

  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I was working tech support for a real estate company. I was seated in my office/server room when I got a knock at the door. It was the boss's assistant. She said she was having a problem. Every time she clicked on a desktop icon, the item opened, and then immediately closed. Then, when she clicked on the Start Menu, the menu popped up, then closed. She was sure the problem was a virus, and I had to admit, I hadn't seen that problem before. So, I followed her to her office and she showed me her PC. I immediately spotted the problem: &quot;First thing we'll need to do is remove the spiral notebook from resting on your keyboard, and most specifically, your escape key.&quot;</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/blameline\"> /u/blameline </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pe722o/well_i_havent_seen_this_problem_before/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pe722o/well_i_havent_seen_this_problem_before/\">[comments]</a></span>"

  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I work in a family run it support shop for private and business customers (around 500 users) and some of our support contracts involve health check-ups on PC's remotely. I've only been here for a few months</p> <p>Usually these consist of running Windows updates, Office updates and generally basic hygiene of a PC. We took on a new client under one of these support contracts which means we usually try to remote on the 2nd week of the month. On the day I contacted the user to leave their machine's on so we can remote on trigger the updates, save work and restart however come 4:10pm (they all leave the office at 4) the machines were not showing as online on our dashboard. </p> <p>​</p> <p>I give the client a call. &quot;oh yeah we put our machines to sleep&quot;</p> <p>​</p> <p>Cue head desk.</p> <p>Edit: a word</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/L3veLUP\"> /u/L3veLUP </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yrckgt/asleep_is_not_on/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yrckgt/asleep_is_not_on/\">[comments]</a></span>"

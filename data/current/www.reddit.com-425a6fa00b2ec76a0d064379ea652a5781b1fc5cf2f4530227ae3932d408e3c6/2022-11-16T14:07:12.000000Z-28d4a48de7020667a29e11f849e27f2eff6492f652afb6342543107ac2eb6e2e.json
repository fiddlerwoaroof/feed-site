I locked my keys in the car, and can't leave&quot;</p> <p>M: &quot;I'm not sure what I can do, did you want me to get you the number for AAA?&quot;</p> <p>U: &quot;Y'all used to come out with a slim Jim and unlock our cars for us&quot;</p> <p>M: &quot;Ma'am, I've been here for 5 years and this is the first time I've heard of this happening...&quot;</p> <p>U: &quot;Can you call maintenance? They used to do this all the time&quot;</p> <p>M: &quot;I'm pretty sure they'd say the same thing, it's a liability issue and if something happens to your car door the company is liable for the damages... Here's their number. You can call them and talk to them.&quot;</p> <p>U: <em>hangs up phone</em></p> <p>About 30 minutes later I follow up with maintenance. They said exactly what I said. They couldn't because of company liability. Apparently happened in the past, and a door got screwed up and were brought to small claims over it. Never again. </p> <p>Wonderful way to start that day.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/theoboley\"> /u/theoboley </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ywucdg/during_a_shift_change/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ywucdg/during_a_shift_change/\">[comments]</a></span>"

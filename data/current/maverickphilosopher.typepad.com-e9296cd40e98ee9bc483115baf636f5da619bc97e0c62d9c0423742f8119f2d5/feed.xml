<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;This entry was first posted on 24 July 2011. Time for a repost with minor modifications. I find that I still reject individual concepts. Surprise!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;..................................&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Consider the sentences &amp;#39;Caissa is a cat&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Every cat is an animal.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160; Edward the Nominalist made two&amp;#0160; claims in&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2011/07/nota-notae-est-nota-rei-ipsius-and-the-ontological-argument.html#comments&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;an earlier comment thread&amp;#0160;&lt;/a&gt;that stuck in my Fregean craw:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;1) The relation between &amp;#39;Caissa&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;cat&amp;#39; is the same as the relation between &amp;#39;cat&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;animal&amp;#39;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;2) The relation between *Caissa* and *cat* is the same as the relation between *cat* and *animal.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Single quotes are being used in the usual way to draw attention to the expression enclosed within them.&amp;#0160; Asterisks are being used to draw attention to the concept expressed by the linguistic item enclosed within them.&amp;#0160; I take it that we agree that concepts are mental in nature in the sense that, were there no minds, there would be no concepts.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Affirming (2), Edward commits himself to individual or singular concepts.&amp;#0160; I deny that there are individual concepts and so I reject (2).&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Rejecting (2), I take the side of the Fregeans against the traditional formal logicians (TFL-ers) who think that singular propositions can be analyzed as general.&amp;#0160; Thus &amp;#39;Caissa is a cat&amp;#39; gets analyzed by the TFL-ers &amp;#0160;as &amp;#39;Every Caissa is a cat.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;To discuss this profitably we need to&amp;#0160;agree on the following definition of &amp;#39;individual concept&amp;#39;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D1. C is an individual concept of x =&lt;sub&gt;df&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#0160;x is an instance of C, and it is not possible that there be a y distinct from x such that y is an instance of C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;So if there is an individual concept of my cat Caissa, then Caissa instantiates this concept and nothing distinct from Caissa does&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;or could&lt;/em&gt; instantiate it. We can therefore say that individual concepts, if there are any, &amp;#39;capture&amp;#39; or &amp;#0160;&amp;#39;grasp&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;make present to the mind&amp;#39; the very haecceity (non-qualitative thisness) of the individuals of which they are the individual concepts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;We can also speak of individual concepts as singular concepts and contrast them with general concepts.&amp;#0160; *Cat* is a general concept.&amp;#0160; What makes it general is not that it has many instances, although it dos have many instances, but that it &lt;em&gt;can have&lt;/em&gt; many (two or more) instances.&amp;#0160; General concepts are thus multiply instantiable.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The concept C1 expressed by &amp;#39;the fattest cat that ever lived and ever will live&amp;#39; is also general.&amp;#0160; For, supposing that Oscar instantiates this concept, it is possible that some other feline instantiate it.&amp;#0160; Thus C1 does not capture the haecceity of Oscar or of any cat.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;C1 is general, not singular.&amp;#0160; C1 is multiply instantiable in the sense that it can have two or more instances, though not in the same possible world or at the same time.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;And so from the fact that a concept applies to exactly one thing if it applies to anything, one cannot validly infer that it is an individual or singular concept.&amp;#0160; Such a concept must capture the very identity or non-qualitative thisness of the thing of which it is a concept.&amp;#0160; This is an important point.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;To push further I introduce a definition and a lemma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D2. C is a&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;concept =&lt;sub&gt;df&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#0160;C involves no specific individual and can be grasped without reference to any specific individual.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Thus &amp;#39;green,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;green door,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;bigger than a barn,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;self-identical,&amp;#39; &amp;#0160;and &amp;#39;married to someone&amp;#39; all express pure concepts.&amp;#0160; &amp;#39;Taller than the Washington Monument,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;married to Heidegger,&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;identical to Heidegger&amp;#39; express impure concepts, if they express concepts at all.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma 1: No individual concept is a pure concept.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#0160; By (D1), if C is an individual concept of x, then it is not possible that there be a y distinct from x such that y instantiates C.&amp;#0160; But every pure concept, no matter how specific, even unto maximal specificity, is possibly such as to have two or more instances.&amp;#0160; Therefore, no individual concept is a pure concept.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Consider the famous Max Black example of two iron spheres alike in all monadic and relational respects.&amp;#0160; A pure concept of either, no matter how specific, would also be a pure concept of the other.&amp;#0160; And so the non-qualitative haecceity of neither would be captured by that pure concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma 2.&amp;#0160; No individual concept is an impure concept.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#0160; An individual &amp;#0160;concept is either pure or impure.&amp;#0160; If C is impure, then by (D2) it must involve an individual.&amp;#0160; And if C is an individual concept it must involve the very individual of which it is the individual concept. But&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;individuum ineffabile est&lt;/em&gt;: no individual can be grasped precisely &lt;em&gt;as an individual.&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;But that is precisely what one would have to be able to do to have an impure concept of an individual.&amp;#0160; Therefore, no individual concept is an impure concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Putting the lemmata together, it follows that an individual concept cannot be either pure or impure.&amp;#0160; But it must be one or the other.&amp;#0160; So there are no individual concepts. Q. E. D.!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c0282e11cd074200b-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Indiscernible&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535ce1cf6970c0282e11cd074200b image-full img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c0282e11cd074200b-800wi&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;Indiscernible&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<title>Mark Sainsbury on Intentional Relations</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Following A. N. Prior, Sainsbury sets up the problem of intentionality as follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;We are faced with a paradox: some intentional states are relational and some are not. But all intentional states are the same kind of thing, and things of the same kind are either all relational or all non-relational.&amp;#0160; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marksainsbury.net/uploads/9/7/2/9/97295048/9-argumenta-22-mark-sainsbury-intentional-relations.pdf&quot;&gt;Intentional Relations&lt;/a&gt;, 327)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Cast in the mold of an aporetic triad:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;1) Some intentional states are relational and some are not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;2) All intentional states are the same kind of thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;3) Things of the same kind are either all relational or all non-relational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;These propositions are individually plausible but jointly inconsistent. Sainsbury solves the problem by rejecting (1).&amp;#0160; He maintains that all intentional states are relational.&amp;#0160; Whether I am thinking about Obama, who exists, or about Pegasus, who does not exist, a relation is involved.&amp;#0160; In both cases, the relation connects the subject or his mental state to a representation. The representation, in turn, either represents something that exists &amp;#39;in the world&amp;#39; or it does not.&amp;#0160; In the first case, there is me, my intentional or object-directed mental state, the concept OBAMA, and the man himself in the external world.&amp;#0160; In the second case, there is me, my intentional or object-directed mental state, the concept PEGASUS, and that&amp;#39;s it: there is nothing in reality that the Pegasus representation represents.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Sainsbury is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying that when I think about Obama, I am thinking about a representation. Plainly, I am thinking about a man, and a man is not a representation in a mind.&amp;#0160; While Sainsbury advocates a representationalist theory of mind (RTM), he essays to steer clear of &amp;quot;. . . a disastrous turn that a representationalist view may take: instead of saying that the intentional states are about what their representations are about, the fatal temptation for British Empiricist thinkers (and others) is to regard the intentional states as about the representations (“ideas”) themselves.&amp;quot; (330)&amp;#0160; On Sainsbury&amp;#39;s RTM,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;For representationalists, all intentional states, including perceptual states, are relational, but the representations are not the “objects” of the states in the sense of what the states are about. Rather, the representations are what bring represented objects “before the mind”. Analogously, we see by using our eyes, but we do not see our eyes. Using our eyes does not make our vision indirect. (330)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;This implies that representations are not representatives or stand-ins or epistemic deputies or cognitive intermediaries interposed between mind and world. They are not like pictures. A picture of Obama is an object of vision just as Obama himself is.&amp;#0160; But Sainsburian representations &amp;quot;neither react appropriately with light nor emit odiferous molecules.&amp;quot; (330)&amp;#0160; Pictures of Obama and Obama in the flesh do both. Representations are in the mind but not before the mind. They are &amp;quot;exercised&amp;quot; in intentional states without being the objects of such states:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Intentional states are not normally about the representations they exercise. The representation is not the state’s “object”, as that is often used. Rather, the state’s object is whatever, if anything, the representation refers to, or is about. The notion of “aboutness” needed to make this true is itself intensional: a representation may be about Pegasus, and a thought about Pegasus involves a representation about him. (338)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Sainsbury&amp;#39;s solution to the problem codified in the above inconsistent triad involves two steps. The first is to reject (1) and hold that all intentional states are relational.&amp;#0160; They are genuine relations, not merely relation-like. The second step is to import relationality into the mind: every intentional state is a relational state that connects two intramental existing items, one being the intentional state itself, the other being the representation, whether it be a truth-evaluable representation, which S. calls a thought, or a non-truth-evaluable representation, which S. calls a concept.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;It is easy to see that one could take the first step without taking the second. One could hold that all intentional states are relations but that these relations tie intentional states to mind-transcendent items, whether existent, like Obama, or nonexistent, like Pegasus. But this is the way of Meinong or quasi-Meinong, not the way of Sainsbury. He argues in the paper in question against Meinong for reasons I will not go into here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;In sum, intentional states are relations, but they are neither relations to mental objects nor are they relations to extramental objects.&amp;#0160; They are relations to representations which are neither.&amp;#0160; A mental object is (or can be) both in the mind and before the mind.&amp;#0160; And extramental object is (or can be) before the mind but not in the mind. A Sainsburian representation is in the mind but not before the mind (except in cases of reflection as when I reflect on the concept OBAMA as opposed to thinking about him directly).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The article ends as follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Metaphysical relationality is the fundamental feature of intentional states, the nature they all share. In the original puzzle, it was claimed that Raoul’s thinking about Pegasus is not relational, since there is no such thing as Pegasus, whereas his thinking about Obama is relational, since there is such a thing as Obama. But in both cases the claims are made true by Raoul being in a two-place relational state, involving a Pegasus-representation in one case and an Obama representation in the other. The metaphysical underpinning of thinking about Pegasus is just as relational as his thinking about Obama. For the Pegasus case, that is not because there really is such a nonexistent object as Pegasus, but because the truth-making state is a relational one, holding between Raoul and, in the typical case, the concept PEGASUS. For the Obama case, the state is relational in the relevant way not because there is such an object as Obama, but because the truth-making state is a relational one, holding between Raoul and, in the typical case, the concept OBAMA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;CRITIQUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Does this solve our problem? I don&amp;#39;t see that it does.&amp;#0160; First of all, we are left with the problem of the intentionality of representations. What makes an Obama representation about Obama?&amp;#0160; Sainsbury&amp;#39;s solution to the Prior puzzle is to reject the first limb of the aporetic triad by maintaining that ALL intentional states are relational.&amp;#0160; But since these relations are all intramental we are left with the problem of external reference.&amp;#0160; We are left with no account of the of-ness or aboutness of representations.&amp;#0160; We need an account not only of noetic intentionality but of noematic intentionality as well, to press some Husserlian jargon into service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Second, it is not clear from this article what exactly representations are. We are told that &amp;quot;representations are what bring represented objects &amp;#39;before the mind&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; How exactly?&amp;#0160; Talk of the &amp;quot;exercise&amp;quot; of representations suggests that they are dispositions.&amp;#0160; Is the concept OBAMA in Raoul his being disposed to identify exactly one thing as Obama?&amp;#0160; But how could an occurrent episode of thinking-of be accounted for dispositionally? Besides, the concept OBAMA would have to be a haecceity-concept and I have more than once pointed out the difficulties with such a posit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Another sign of decline is the proliferation of food shows,&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tvfoodmaps.com/show/US-Bacon&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;The U. S. of Bacon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;being one of them.&amp;#0160; A big fat &amp;#39;foody&amp;#39; roams the land in quest of diners and dives that put bacon into everything.&amp;#0160; As something of a trencherman back in the day, I understand the lure of the table.&amp;#0160; But I am repelled by the spiritual vacuity of those who wax ecstatic over some greasy piece of crud &amp;#0160;they have just eaten, or speak of some edible item as &amp;#39;to die for.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;It is natural for a beast to be bestial, but not for a man.&amp;#0160; He must degrade and denature himself, and that only a spiritual being can do.&amp;#0160; Freely degrading himself, he becomes&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;a beast thereby proving that he is -- more than a beast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;People are generally aware of the importance of good nutrition, physical exercise and all things health-related. They understand that what they put into their bodies affects their physical health.&amp;#0160; Underappreciated is a truth just as if not more important: that what one puts into one&amp;#39;s mind affects one&amp;#39;s mental and spiritual health. The soul has its foods and its poisons just as the body does. This&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; simple truth, known for centuries, goes unheeded while liberals fall all over each other climbing aboard the various environmental and health bandwagons.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Second-hand smoke the danger of which is negligible much exercises our leftist pals while the soul-destroying toxicity of the mass &amp;#39;entertainment&amp;#39; media concerns them not at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Why are those so concerned with physical toxins so tolerant of cultural toxins? This is another example of what I call misplaced moral enthusiasm. You worry about global warming and side stream smoke when you give no thought to the soul, its foods, and its poisons?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 17.3333px;&quot;&gt;............................&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lewis sets the scene in &lt;em&gt;Mere Christianity&lt;/em&gt;: The theater lights dim, the band begins to play softly and sensuously as a man enters from stage left carrying a silver tray which is covered by a white cloth. He walks to the middle of the stage and begins dancing lewdly before setting the tray with the white cloth on a table. He whirls his hands over his head and then moves slowly and deliberately as he slides the cover off the silver tray. In the middle of the tray is a pork chop.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Of course, his seventy-year-old vision has come true in America today. From the Food Channel to “Chopped,” we are strangely twisted and out of control with our love for food.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;As promised &lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2021/08/saturday-night-at-the-oldies-my-bob-dylan-top-ten.html&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akJQX1N65G4&quot;&gt;Baby Let Me Follow You Down&lt;/a&gt;, 1962. From Bob&amp;#39;s first album. Lord almighty it is good to hear this again. Dylan played better guitar and harmonic in the early days.&amp;#0160; The surging, full-throated harp beats the sometimes-annoying tweets and toots of his later harmonic playing.&amp;#0160; Dylan opens by telling us that he learned this song from Rick [Eric] von Schmidt when he met him one day in &amp;quot;the green pastures of Harvard University.&amp;quot; Was he thinking of Woody Guthrie&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH2DJvgNlMA&quot;&gt;Pastures of Plenty&lt;/a&gt;, 1944? Dylan&amp;#39;s effort&amp;#0160; apparently derives from von Schmidt&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ooGMnNPOeE&quot;&gt;Baby Let Me Lay it on You&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Here is a real gem of a find: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYIFmHvaqjU&quot;&gt;Bob Dylan Jamming with Eric von Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, May, 1964.&amp;#0160; Eric von Schmidt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHCfRDKa0U&quot;&gt;Envy the Thief&lt;/a&gt;. Back to the Dylan top ten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMFj8uDubsE&quot;&gt;Blowin&amp;#39; in the Wind&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;em&gt;Freewheelin&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; album, Bob&amp;#39;s second. His best civil rights anthem. Topical but allusive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5al0HmR4to&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;A Hard Rain&amp;#39;s A-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5al0HmR4to&quot;&gt;Gonna Fall&lt;/a&gt;. Also from The Freewheelin&amp;#39; Bob Dylan.&amp;#0160; Said to have been written during the Cuban Missile Crisis, October 1962. I remember it like it was yesterday.&amp;#0160; Joan Baez&amp;#39;s transcendently beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMalmwupji8&quot;&gt;cover&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spanish Harlem Incident&lt;/em&gt;. Fourth album, We&amp;#39;ll make do with the Byrds&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G3s1vpiSx0&quot;&gt;cover&lt;/a&gt;. Not that it isn&amp;#39;t good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4HW33SgZlM&quot;&gt;Its All Over Now, Baby Blue&lt;/a&gt;. Fifth album, probably my favorite.&amp;#0160; This one goes out to Charaine H., and our bittersweet relationship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Forget the dead you&amp;#39;ve left, they will not follow you &lt;br /&gt;The vagabond who&amp;#39;s rapping at your door &lt;br /&gt;Is standing in the clothes that you once wore &lt;br /&gt;Strike another match, go start anew &lt;br /&gt;And it&amp;#39;s all over now, baby blue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Going to a Dylan concert in those days was like going to church. Absolute silence except for the man on stage standing alone singing his own songs and accompanying himself on guitar and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dummies.com/art-center/music/harmonica/why-is-a-harmonica-called-a-harp-when-it-doesnt-have-strings/&quot;&gt;harp&lt;/a&gt;.

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The following argument appears valid:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Some deity is called &amp;#39;Zeus.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Zeus is wise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Therefore, some deity called &amp;#39;Zeus&amp;#39; is wise. (D. E. Buckner, &lt;em&gt;Reference and Identity&lt;/em&gt;, 118)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Now if an argument is valid, it is valid in virtue of its logical form.&amp;#0160; What is the logical form of the above argument? The following argument-form, Buckner correctly states, is invalid:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Ex Fx&lt;br /&gt;Ga&lt;br /&gt;Ex (Fx &amp;amp; Gx)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;So if the form just depicted is the only available form of the original argument, then the validity of the argument cannot be simply a matter of logical form. And this is what Buckner concludes: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;It is clearly the anaphoric connection between the premisses that makes the argument valid, but no such connection exists in the formalized version of the argument. &amp;quot;(119)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Buckner seems to be arguing as follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;a) The original argument is valid.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;b) The only form it could possibly have is the one depicted above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;c) The argument-form depicted is plainly invalid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Therefore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;d) The validity of the original argument cannot be due to its logical form, but must be due to the anaphoric connection between its premises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I do not find this argument rationally compelling. (b) is rejectable.&amp;#0160; I suggest that the original argument is an enthymeme the logical form of which is the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;1) For some x, x is called &amp;#39;a.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;2) For any x, if x is called &amp;#39;a,&amp;#39; then x =a.&lt;br /&gt;3) a is G.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore&lt;br /&gt;4) For some x, (x is called &amp;#39;a&amp;#39; and x is G).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Robert Paul Wolff &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-reply-to-inquiry_27.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;replies with wit and lefty snark to a charming request by one Pamela N., a personal assistant, who wants to know who Immanuel Kant is referring to when he writes, &amp;quot;Caius is a man; man is mortal; therefore, Caius is mortal.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; Pamela confesses,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I will admit, I have not read Kant&amp;#39;s works. I have, however, spent the last couple of hours combing through post after post after post about this particular quote from the book and cannot find a single soul who would say who they think Caius is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;In reading these many posts, I have come to the conclusion that Kant is probably referring to Pope Caius as he has been venerated by the Catholic Church as a Saint. Given that title, and the fact that Saint&amp;#39;s [sic] are given to [sic] a quasi-immortal status [sic], I have ascertained that this is who Kant is most likely referring to. My question for you is, do you think that my assumption is correct? or do you have a deeper insight into who he is referring to?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Agreement on matters of moment, religious, political, and philosophical, seems out of reach. But we may be able to reach clarity about our respective positions on the issues that divide us.&amp;#0160; That&amp;#39;s what I used to think.&amp;#0160; I used to think that clarity is attainable even if agreement is not.&amp;#0160; But now I think that things are worse than I thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;For the attaining of clarity requires &lt;em&gt;agreement&lt;/em&gt; on what the issues are: we have to agree on the identity of the issues&amp;#0160; and how they are to be formulated. &lt;em&gt;Do we agree&lt;/em&gt; on the issues and questions? Do we agree about what we are asking when we ask whether God exists? Or whether there are rights? Or whether the USA is systemically racist? Or whether there is climate change? The depth of disagreement may be such that we cannot attain clarity.&amp;#0160; It may be that neither agreement nor clarity&amp;#0160; are attainable goals. Philosophers often disagree about what they are disagreeing about. I need to adduce&amp;#0160; further examples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Almost Mugged in the Big Easy</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I came close to being mugged in New Orleans&amp;#39; French Quarter in &amp;#39;90 or &amp;#39;91. I was there to read &amp;#0160;a paper at an American Philosophical Association meeting. &amp;#0160;Early one morning I left the hotel to sample the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/local-color&quot;&gt;local color&lt;/a&gt; and grab some breakfast. Striding along Bourbon street, I noticed a couple of black dudes on the other side of the street. &amp;#0160;I was wearing a beret, which may have suggested to the loiterers that I was a foreigner and an easy mark. One dude approached and commented on my shoes in an obvious attempt to distract me and throw me off my guard. My situational awareness saved me. That, together with my stern mien, height, leather jacket and purposeful stride. &amp;#0160;I gave the punk a hard look, increased my pace, and blew him off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Profiling is part of situational awareness. Profiling is just common sense, which is why &amp;#39;progressive&amp;#39; fools oppose it. A couple of black youths loitering in a touristy area are probably up to no good. It is a well-known fact that blacks as a group and more criminally prone than whites as a group. There is nothing racist about pointing that out because a fact about race is not a racist fact.&amp;#0160; It cannot be racist to speak the truth in situations where it is important that the truth be spoken. But if common sense and truth-telling make me a racist, then we should all be racists, including decent black folk.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee9627e200c-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bourbon Street Nawlins&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee9627e200c image-full img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee9627e200c-800wi&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;Bourbon Street Nawlins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Given the limitations of our postlapsarian predicament, good relations with others must needs be limited relations. Familiarity breeds contempt. Propinquity militates against politeness. Conservatives understand that a certain formality in our relations with others, both within and without the family, helps maintain respect. Formality helps keep in check the incivility bred of familiarity.&amp;#0160; Reserve has a preservative effect.&amp;#0160; &amp;#0160;Saying less more often accrues to our benefit than saying more. How often have you brought trouble upon your head by simply keeping your mouth shut?&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;So much for &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; relations. &lt;em&gt;Deep&lt;/em&gt; relations are another story. In them we court danger. We go deep, we probe, we &amp;#39;let it all hang out&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvxJ0TVvVzE&quot;&gt;after midnight&lt;/a&gt; of the work-a-day round. You should run the risk from time to time.&amp;#0160; Risk rejection and worse. Otherwise, when it comes time to die, you won&amp;#39;t be able to say that you really squeezed the fruit of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLhYghzNfII&amp;amp;list=RDMLhYghzNfII&amp;amp;start_radio=1&amp;amp;rv=MLhYghzNfII&amp;amp;t=18&quot;&gt;lemon tree&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;A re-post with minor edits and additions from 4 September 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;......................................&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Ed Buckner wants to re-fight old battles. I&amp;#39;m game. The following&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://trinities.org/blog/what-is-logical-form-the-form-of/&quot;&gt;post of his&lt;/a&gt;, reproduced verbatim, just appeared at Dale Tuggy&amp;#39;s site:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The concept of logical form is essential to any discussion of identity, and hence to any discussion of the Trinity. Here is a puzzle I have been discussing with the famous&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/&quot;&gt;Bill Vallicella&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;for many years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;(Argument 1) ‘Cicero is a Roman, therefore Cicero is a Roman’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;(Argument 2) ‘Cicero is a Roman, therefore Tully is a Roman’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;My puzzle [is] that the first argument is clearly not valid if the first ‘Cicero’ means the Roman, the second the American town, yet the argument seems to instantiate a valid form. Bill&amp;#0160;objects that if there is equivocation, then the argument&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;has the form ‘a is F, therefore b is F’, which fails to instantiate a valid form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I then ask what is the form&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly not of the sentences, since the sentences do not include the meaning or the proposition. Is it the form of the proposition expressed by the sentences? But then we have the problem of the second argument, where both ‘Cicero’ and ‘Tully’ mean the same man. Then the man is contained in both propositions, and if the form is of the proposition, the argument has the true form ‘a is F, so a is F’, which is valid. But I think no one would agree that the second argument is valid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;So logical form does not belong to the sentences, nor to the propositions expressed by them. So what is it the form&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee8f470200c-pi&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Tully&amp;#39;s&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee8f470200c img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee8f470200c-320wi&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;&quot; title=&quot;Tully&amp;#39;s&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My answer is that the logical form of the argument is the form of the &lt;em&gt;Fregean&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;propositions expressed by the sentences that make up the argument. Let me explain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I agree with Ed that logical form is not the form of an array of sentence-tokens. It is rather the form of an array of propositions expressed by the sentences. (To be painfully precise: it is the form of an array of propositions expressed by the assertive utterance, and thus the tokening, of a series of sentence-types by a speaker or thinker on a given occasion. A sentence-token buried in a book does not express anything by itself!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;To solve Ed&amp;#39;s puzzle we need to distinguish three views of propositions: the Aristotelian, the Fregean, and the Russellian. This would be a good topic for an extended post. Here I will be brief. &amp;#0160;Brevity is the soul of blog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;An&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;Aristotelian proposition&lt;/strong&gt; is an assertively uttered meaningful sentence in the indicative mood that expresses a complete thought. &amp;#0160;What makes such a proposition &amp;#39;Aristotelian&amp;#39; as opposed to &amp;#39;Platonic&amp;#39; is that the meaning of the sentence is not something that can subsist on its own apart from the assertive tokening of the sentence. &amp;#0160;The meaning of the sentence depends on its being expressed, whether in overt speech or in thought, by someone. And this expression must be thoughtfully done and not mindlessly like a parrot or a voice synthesizer. If there were no minds there would be no Aristotelian propositions. And if there were no languages there would be no Aristotelian propositions. In this sense, Aristotelian propositions are linguistic entities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;In brief: An Aristotelian proposition is just a declarative sentence in use together with its dependent sense or meaning. Suppose I write a declarative sentence on a piece of paper. The Aristotelian proposition is not the string of physical marks on the paper, nor it is the producing of the marks; it is the marks as produced by a minded organism on a particular occasion together with the meaning those marks embody where meaning is first in the mind and only then embodied in the marks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;A&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;Fregean&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;proposition&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;is a&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;nonlinguistic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;entity that subsists independently of minds and language. It is the sense (&lt;em&gt;Sinn&lt;/em&gt;) of a declarative sentence (&lt;em&gt;Satz&lt;/em&gt;) from which indexical elements have been extruded. For example, &amp;#39;I am blogging&amp;#39; &amp;#0160;does not express a Fregean proposition because of the indexical &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; and because of the present tense of the verb phrase. &amp;#0160;But &amp;#39;BV blogs at 10:50 AM PST on 4 September 2017&amp;#39; expresses a Fregean proposition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Fregean senses are extralinguistic and extramental &amp;#39;abstract&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Platonic&amp;#39; items. They are not in time or space even when the objects they are about are in time and space. This is what makes Fregean propositions &amp;#39;Platonic&amp;#39; rather than &amp;#39;Aristotelian.&amp;#39; Fregean propositions are the primary truth-bearers; the sentences that express them are derivatively true or false.&amp;#0160; Likewise with the judgments whose content they are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;A&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;Russellian&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;proposition&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;is a blurry, hybrid entity that combines some of the features of a Fregean truth-&lt;em&gt;bearer&lt;/em&gt; and some of the features of a truth-&lt;em&gt;maker&lt;/em&gt;. A Russellian proposition does not reside at the level of sense (&lt;em&gt;Sinn&lt;/em&gt;) but at the level of reference (&lt;em&gt;Bedeutung&lt;/em&gt;). &amp;#0160;It is out there in the (natural) world. It is what some of us call a fact or &amp;#39;concrete fact&amp;#39; (as in my existence book) and others, e.g. D. M. Armstrong,&amp;#0160; a state of affairs. &amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Now consider a singular sentence such as &amp;#39;Ed is happy.&amp;#39; &amp;#0160;For present purposes, the crucial difference between a Fregean proposition and a Russellian proposition is that, on the Fregean view, the subject constituent of&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;Ed is happy&lt;/em&gt; is not Ed himself with skin and hair, but an abstract surrogate that represents him in the Fregean proposition, whereas in the Russellian proposition Ed himself is a constituent of the proposition!&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;We needn&amp;#39;t consider why so many distinguished philosophers have opted for this (monstrous) view. &amp;#0160;But this is the view that seems to have Ed in its grip and that powers his puzzle above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;If we take the relatively saner (but nonetheless problematic) view that propositions are Fregean in nature, then the puzzle is easily solved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Ed asks: What is the logical form the form of? &amp;#0160;He maintains, rightly, that it cannot be the form of an array of sentences. So it must be the form of an array of propositions. Right again. But then he falls into puzzlement:&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;. . . ‘Cicero’ and ‘Tully’ mean the same man. Then the man is contained in both propositions, and if the form is of the proposition, the argument has the true form ‘a is F, so a is F’, which is valid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The puzzlement disappears if we reject the Russsellian theory of propositions. A man cannot be contained in a proposition, and so it cannot be the same man in both propositions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;‘Cicero is a Roman, therefore Tully is a Roman’ is plainly invalid. Its form is:&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;Rc, ergo Rt&lt;/em&gt;, which is an invalid form. If we adopt &amp;#0160;either an Aristotelian or a Fregean view of propositions we will not be tempted to think otherwise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;‘Cicero is a Roman, therefore Cicero is a Roman’ is plainly valid.&amp;#0160;‘Cicero is a Roman, therefore Tully is a Roman’ is plainly invalid. The logical forms are different! If, on a Russellian theory of propositions, the forms are the same, then so much the worse for a Russellian theory of propositions!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Deeply moved by it, I bought the 45 rpm single and noted that the song was written by one B. Dylan. I pronounced the name to myself as &amp;#39;Dial in&amp;#39; and had a sense that this songwriter was about to speak to me and my life.&amp;#0160; And here he is still speaking to my &amp;#39;lived experience&amp;#39; 60 years later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Few songs capture the &amp;#39;magic&amp;#39; of the &amp;#39;60s like this one. But you had to have been there, of a certain impressionable age, with the right disposition, with an open mind, and an open heart, idealistic, a seeker, and at least a little alienated from the larger society and the quiet desperation and dead usages of parents and relatives . . . .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;YouTuber comment:&amp;#0160; &amp;quot;This Bob Dylan song brings me to tears and I don&amp;#39;t know why. I&amp;#39;m 76 years old and remember when it was new. It still is.&amp;quot; Comment on the comment:&amp;#0160; &amp;quot;This is a nostalgic feeling for the passing of the time. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade&quot;&gt;saudade&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;of a time whose dreams seem&amp;#0160; real. I know about it. I&amp;#39;m 71.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

YouTuber comment: &amp;quot;All my life, Dylan has been able to touch my soul. This is undoubtedly one of his best.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;An alternative Dylan top ten next week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The short statements below are from my Facebook page.&amp;#0160; It is important to explain to the open-minded and politically uncommitted, in a pithy and non-polemical way, what American conservatives stand for.&amp;#0160; The American conservative, as I use the term, is neither a throne-and-altar neo-reactionary, nor is he an alt-Right tribalist. His conservatism takes on board the best of classical liberalism. You could call him a paleo-liberal. And of course he is far from the yap-and-scribble, do-nothing &amp;#39;cruise ship&amp;#39; pseudo-conservatives who are willing to accept political dhimmitude so long as their perquisites and privileges and invitations to the tonier Beltway salons remain intact.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;My &amp;#39;voice&amp;#39; over at Facebook is usually polemical, unlike the shorts below. I tread the razor&amp;#39;s edge between saying what needs to be said about incendiary topics and getting de-platformed.&amp;#0160; Polemical discourse, including invective, mockery, and the rest are justified by the fact we are engaged in a war with the destructive Left over the soul of America.&amp;#0160; You are welcome to join me, but just be sure to read the pinned post at the top of the page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;THE FIRST OBLIGATION OF GOVERNMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The main obligation of a government is to protect and serve the citizens of the country of which it is the government. It is a further question whether it has obligations to protect and benefit the citizens of other countries. That is debatable. But if it does, those obligations are trumped by the main obligation just mentioned. I should think that a great nation such as the USA does well to engage in purely humanitarian efforts such as famine relief. Such efforts are arguably supererogatory and not obligatory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;America First is as sound an idea as that each family has the right to prefer its interests over the interests of other families. If my wife becomes ill, then my obligation is to care for her and expend such financial resources as are necessary to see to her welfare. If this means reducing my charitable contributions to the local food bank, then so be it. Whatever obligations I have to help others &amp;#39;ripple out&amp;#39; from myself as center, losing claim to my attention the farther out they go, much like the amplitude of waves caused by a rock&amp;#39;s falling into a pond diminishes the farther from the point of impact. Spouse and/or children first, then other family members, then old friends, then new friends, then neighbors, and so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The details are reasonably disputable, but not the general principle. The general principle is that we are justified in looking to our own first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;AMERICA FIRST does not mean that that the USA ought to be first over other countries, dominating them. It means that every country has the right to prefer itself and its own interests over the interests of other countries. We say &amp;#39;America first&amp;#39; because we are Americans; the Czechs say or ought to say &amp;#39;Czech Republic first.&amp;#39; The general principle is that every country has a right to grant preference to itself and its interests over the interests of other countries while respecting their interests and right to self-determination. America First is but an instance of the general principle. The principle, then, is Country First.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;ENLIGHTENED NATIONALISM AND CHAUVINISM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;America First has nothing to do with chauvinism which could be characterized as a blind and intemperate patriotism, a belligerent and unjustified belief in the superiority of one&amp;#39;s own country. America First expresses an enlightened nationalism which is obviously compatible with a sober recognition of national failings. Germany has a rather sordid history; but Germany First is compatible with a recognition of the wrong turn that great nation took during a well-known twelve-year period (1933-1945) in her history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;NATIONALISM, NATIVISM, ISOLATIONISM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;An enlightened nationalism is distinct from nativism inasmuch as the former does not rule out immigration. By definition, an immigrant is not a native; but an enlightened American nationalism accepts immigrants who accept American values, which of course are not the values of the Left or of political Islam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;An enlightened nationalism is not isolationist. What it eschews is a fruitless meddling and over-eager interventionism. It does not rule out certain necessary interventions when they are in our interests and in the interests of our allies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;So America First is not to be confused with chauvinism or nativism or isolationism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Returning to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2021/08/the-third-way-of-the-ostrich.html#comments&quot;&gt;ongoing thread&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;So to summarise the discussion so far. The doctrine of&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;Reference and Identity&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;is that empty names can refer. That is because the verb phrase ‘refers to’ is&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;intentional&lt;/em&gt;. That is, “S refers to N” is consistent with “there is no such thing as N”. Contrast with “S touches N” which implies there is such a thing as N.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;[. . .]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Do you see any problem with that position?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;When you say, &amp;quot;empty names can refer,&amp;quot; do you mean that some empty names refer and some empty names do not refer? Or do you mean that all empty names refer? (Compare:&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;If I said that integers can be either odd or even, that would be equivalent to saying that&amp;#0160; some integers are odd and some are even.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I will assume that you mean that all empty names refer.&amp;#0160; You say that this is because &amp;#39;refers to&amp;#39; is intentional. It is intentional in the very same way that thinking-of is intentional. To think is to think of something. But &amp;#39;A thinks of&amp;#0160; N&amp;#39; is logically consistent with &amp;#39;there is no such thing as N.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160; If I am thinking of Asmodeus, it does not follow that I am thinking of something that exists.&amp;#0160; So far, so good. Now I take it that you hold that the following are all logically equivalent where the substituends for &amp;#39;N&amp;#39; are proper names such as &amp;#39;Moses&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Asmodeus.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;There is no such thing as N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;There exists no such thing as N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;It is not the case that there exists an x such that x = N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;It is not the case that some existing thing is identical to N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;It is not the case that something is identical to N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;No existing thing is identical to N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Nothing is identical to N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;N is not a member of the class K of existing things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;N is not a member of class K of things.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;You are making the following additional assumptions. Everything exists. (Quine contra &amp;#39;Wyman.&amp;#39;) &amp;#39;Is&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;exists&amp;#39; have the same sense. &amp;#39;Existential quantifier&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;particular quantifier&amp;#39; are two different names for one and the same quantifier.&amp;#0160; &amp;#39;N does not exist&amp;#39; says just this: it is not the case that something is identical to N.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 17.3333px;&quot;&gt;Your view implies a contradiction:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;1) Empty names such as &amp;#39;Asmodeus&amp;#39; refer. (R &amp;amp; I, 9-10)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;2) To refer is to refer to something. (R &amp;amp; I, 9-10)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Therefore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;3) &amp;#39;Asmodeus&amp;#39; refers to something. (As you explicitly state, &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;4) In the case of &amp;#39;Asmodeus,&amp;#39; an empty name, &amp;#39;Asmodeus&amp;#39;&amp;#0160; refers to something that does not exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;5) Everything exists.&amp;#0160; (There are no nonexistent things. &amp;#39;Something does not exist&amp;#39; is contradictory.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Therefore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;6) &amp;#39;Asmodeus&amp;#39; refers to nothing.&amp;#0160; (3, 4, 5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Therefore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;7) (3) and (6) are contradictories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Therefore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;8) One of your assumptions is false.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Reader Riccardo writes,&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I remember reading on your blog some time ago an hilarious post with an anecdote on Richard Swinburne. It was about the importance for philosophers of developing practical skills in addition to intellectual ones. In the same post you recounted how you and Swinburne were driving together to a conference and he was driving really really slow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I tried many times and in many ways, but i can&amp;#39;t find that post anymore. Have you deleted it? If you haven&amp;#39;t, could you help me find it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;That entry, filed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/automotive/&quot;&gt;Automotive&lt;/a&gt;, was published on 19 November 2016. Here it is again in a larger font, with Comments enabled. But it wasn&amp;#39;t me and Swinburne who were driving together; had we been travelling together I would have insisted on driving.&amp;#0160; I would have listened to him discourse on the body and the immortal soul while I did my damndest to keep them connected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;...............................................&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Just over the transom:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;C.J. F. Williams told me a [Richard] Swinburne story. Swinburne offered to give him a lift to some philosophy conference, but warned him ‘I only drive at 30 miles an hour’. Christopher thought he meant that he strictly abided by the urban 30 mph speed limit, and accepted the lift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;It turned out that Swinburne&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;never ever&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;drove more than 30 mph, even on the freeway, where in the UK the limit is 70 mph. It took a while to get to there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Slow is not safe on freeways. &amp;#0160;Swinburne is lucky to have lived long enough to be&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2016/09/the-swinburne-dust-up-at-the-society-for-christian-philosophers.html&quot;&gt;insulted&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;by the Society of Christian Philosophers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I have heard rumors to the effect that David Lewis was &amp;#39;automotively challenged.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;My old friend Quentin Smith didn&amp;#39;t drive at all. &amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;One of the reasons that philosophers from&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gypsyscholarship.blogspot.com/2007/12/curious-thalesian-tale.html&quot;&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt; on have been the laughingstock of Thracian maids and other members of &lt;em&gt;hoi polloi&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;is that many of them are incompetent in practical matters. &amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Quentin was just hopeless in mundane matters. The tales I could tell, the telling of which loyalty forbids.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Me? &amp;#0160;I&amp;#39;m an excellent driver, a good cook, a pretty good shot, competent in elementary plumbing, electrical, and automotive change-outs and repairs, and well-versed in personal finance. &amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;A life well-lived is a balanced life. &amp;#0160;You should strive to develop all sides of your personality: intellectual, spiritual, artistic, emotional, and physical.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-c-j-f-williams-1275651.html&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;is an obituary of C. J. F. Williams by Richard Swinburne.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;It came as news to me that Williams spent most of his life in a wheelchair.&amp;#0160; It testifies to the possibilities of the human spirit that great adversity&amp;#0160;for some is no impediment to achievement.&amp;#0160; I think also of Stephen Hawking, Charles Krauthammer, and FDR.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;So stop whining and be grateful for what you have. You could be in a bloody wheelchair!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Your blog post &amp;quot;Philosophers as Bad Drivers?&amp;quot; brought back to memory a philosophy professor that I had as an undergrad and a story he told us about himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/s/Kenneth%20G.%20Ferguson&quot;&gt;Dr. Ken Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; told us a story one day about his time in one of the branches of the military.&amp;#0160; While serving, an officer instructed him to move a jeep.&amp;#0160; Ferguson says he objected and explained to the officer that he simply could not drive.&amp;#0160; The officer wasn&amp;#39;t sympathetic to his excuse and doubled down on his request.&amp;#0160; Ferguson said that he attempted to follow the orders and ended up wrecking the jeep and some other equipment.&amp;#0160; He was not asked to drive again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Ferguson said that he simply does not drive.&amp;#0160; Multiple times I remember seeing him walking down one of the main streets leading to campus in what I suspect was a distance of at least over two miles in the morning, and while always wearing a full suit at that!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Thanks for the story! &amp;#0160;Ferguson is a counterexample to the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stirlingmoss.com/&quot;&gt;Stirling Moss&lt;/a&gt; quotation:&amp;#0160; “There are two things no man will admit he cannot do well: drive and make love.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;One of the reasons philosophy and philosophers get such bad press among the general public &amp;#0160;is because of the high number of oddballs and incompetents in philosophy. Your former professor might have had a number of good reasons for never learning how to drive. &amp;#0160;But I would argue that there are certain things every man ought to know how to do and they include knowing how to drive cars and trucks of various sizes and operate a stick shift. Like it or not, we are material beings in a material world and knowing how to negotiate this world &amp;#0160;is important for us and those with whom we come into contact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;We should develop ourselves as fully and many-sidedly as possible so as to be worthy acolytes of our noble mistress, fair Philosophia. We represent her to the public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<title>On Death: Objective and Subjective Views</title>
<link>https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2021/08/on-death-objective-and-subjective-views.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2021/08/on-death-objective-and-subjective-views.html</guid>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Death viewed objectively seems normal, natural, and &amp;#39;acceptable.&amp;#39; And not evil. Is it evil that the leaves of deciduous trees fall off and die in the autumn? There are more where they came from. It is nature&amp;#39;s way.&amp;#0160; Everything in nature goes the way of the leaves of autumn. If this is not evil, why is it evil when we fall from the &lt;em&gt;Arbor Vitae&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;#0160; Are we not just bits of nature&amp;#39;s fauna? Very special bits, no doubt, but wholly natural nonetheless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Viewed subjectively, however, the matter looks decidedly different. Gaze at someone you love at a moment when your &amp;#39;reasons&amp;#39; for loving the person are most in evidence. Then give unblinkered thought to the proposition that the dearly beloved child or spouse will die and become nothing, that the marvellous depth of interiority that has revealed&amp;#0160; itself as unique to your love will be annihilated, utterly blotted out forever, and soon.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Now turn your thought back on yourself&amp;#0160; and try to confront in all honesty and without evasion your upcoming annihilation as a &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt; of experience and not as just another object among objects. Focus on yourself as a subject&lt;em&gt; for whom there is a world&lt;/em&gt;, and not as an object &lt;em&gt;in the world&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#0160; Entertain with existential clarity the thought that you will not play the transcendental spectator at your demise and cremation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The horror of nonexistence from which Epicurus wanted to free us comes into view only when we view death subjectively:&amp;#0160; &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; as subject, not &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt; as object, or as &amp;#39;one.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160; No doubt &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; dies. But it is not possible that &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; die unless it is is possible that I die or you die, where &amp;#39;you&amp;#39; is singular.&amp;#0160; Viewing myself objectively, I am at a distance from myself and thus in evasion of the fact I as subject&amp;#0160; will become nothing.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;That the self as subject should be annihilated ought to strike one as the exact opposite of normal, natural, and acceptable. It should strike one as a calamity beyond compare. For there are no more where the dearly beloved came from.&amp;#0160; The dearly beloved, whether self or other, is unique, and not just in the 0ne-of-kind sense. For there is no kind whose instantiation is the dearly beloved.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Which view is true? Can either be dismissed? Can they be &amp;#39;mediated&amp;#39; by some dialectical hocus-pocus?&amp;#0160; These are further questions.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;But now it is time for a hard ride as Sol peeps his ancient head over the Superstition ridge line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ingredients of Happiness</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;What makes for happiness?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Acceptance is a good part of it: acceptance of self, of one&amp;#39;s ineluctable&amp;#0160; limitations, of others and their limitations, of one&amp;#39;s lot in life, of one&amp;#39;s place in the natural hierarchy of prowess and intellect and spiritual capacity, acceptance of the inevitable in the world at large.&amp;#0160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Gratitude is another ingredient in happiness: one cultivates gratitude for and appreciation of what one has here and now without comparisons to an idealized past, a feared future, or to the lots of others.&amp;#0160; No regret, resentment, worry, or comparison.&amp;#0160; Comparison breeds envy, one of the seven deadly sins. Be your incomparable self. If you are not yet incomparable, take up self-individuation as a life project. Realize yourself. Your life is more a task than a given, a task of transmuting givens into accomplishments.&amp;#0160; It is the task of becoming actually the unique person you are potentially. But no hankering for what is out of reach. No false ideals. No consorting with the utopian.&amp;#0160; No Lennon-esque imagining of the impossible. No dreaming impossible dreams.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;You were born somewhere in the natural hierarchy of physical endowment, moral and affective and aesthetic sensitivity, mental power, spiritual capacity, and strength of will. But your place in the hierarchy allows for development. Know your place but press against its upper limits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;But of course happiness is not just a matter of attitude and exertion but also rests on contingency and luck.&amp;#0160; We need, but cannot command, the world&amp;#39;s cooperation. Happenstance holds happiness hostage.&amp;#0160; You were dealt a bad hand? Suck it up and play it the best you can for as long as you can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Conservatives emphasize attitude and exertion, leftists happenstance. Both have a point.&amp;#0160; &amp;quot;The harder I work, the luckier I become&amp;quot; is a conservative exaggeration, but a life-enhancing one.&amp;#0160; It is however the foolish conservative who thinks he is self-made and not the beneficiary of a myriad of forces and factors far beyond his control.&amp;#0160; There is truth in Phil Ochs&amp;#39; lament, &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4BYOJ1tc-k&quot;&gt;There but for fortune&lt;/a&gt; go you or I,&amp;quot; but not such truth as to trump the conservative&amp;#39;s exaggeration.&amp;#0160; Weathering &amp;quot;the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://poets.org/poem/hamlet-act-iii-scene-i-be-or-not-be&quot;&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;, Act III, Scene I) he will slog on, &lt;em&gt;per aspera ad astra&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been warning of this for years. Ed West, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2021/08/america-is-turning-into-the-soviet-union/&quot;&gt;America has become its own worst enemy.&lt;/a&gt; Excerpt:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Communists saw their political beliefs as so all-encompassing that even science was political: if science contradicted the goals of communism, it wasn’t science. In today’s United States the slow death of liberalism has resulted in the&lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2020/12/the-perils-of-politicising-science/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;blatant politicisation of science&lt;/a&gt;, to the extent that&amp;#0160;as in Russia,&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/med-schools-are-now-denying-biological&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scientists teach things which are obviously untrue&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;because it supports the prevailing ideology.&amp;#0160;Then there is the media, much of which parrots&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LHatesYouALot/status/1419797358158745600&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;the party line&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;with almost embarrassing, “Comrade Stalin has driven pig iron to record production” levels of conformity. Once again, if you want to hear the truth, go to the BBC (until the young people who run the website take over).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ref-ar&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;America, once the most trusting of societies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is heading in the direction of Russia&lt;/a&gt;, one of the least trusting.&amp;#0160;Most disturbing of all is that, formerly the most demographically vibrant of western countries, today the United States has suffered a&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ebauer/2019/11/30/another-record-low-will-the-us-fertility-rates-collapse-ever-end/?sh=663c6ff95e45&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spectacular collapse in fertility.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;This is mostly down to stagnant wages among the middle class, who can no longer afford a&amp;#0160;family with one breadwinner, and a rapid decline of religious faith. But maybe people have also lost belief in themselves, and the ideals of their country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The Soviet Union broke into 15 different pieces, and the transition was, as CNN might put it, mostly peaceful — although Gorbachev’s old dacha is now in Russia once again after some local unpleasantness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Today it is the United States where people talk of&lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/563221-shocking-poll-finds-many-americans-now-want-to.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;secession,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;escaping a crumbling superpower ruled by geriatrics. This seems very unlikely to happen, more clickbait than reality, because why would you leave what has been for more than two centuries the richest, most impressive state on earth? But then a generation ago few would have foreseen the Soviet Union crumbling in a haze of alcoholic despair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>The Characteristic Attitude of the Pyrrhonists</title>
<link>https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2021/08/the-characteristic-attitude-of-the-pyrrhonists.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2021/08/the-characteristic-attitude-of-the-pyrrhonists.html</guid>
<description>Benson Mates, The Skeptic Way, Oxford UP, 1996, p. 5: &quot;. . . the characteristic attitude of the Pyrrhonists is one of aporia, of being at a a loss, puzzled, stumped, stymied.&quot; Aporia is not doubt. Doubt implies understanding, but...</description>
<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Benson Mates,&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;The Skeptic Way&lt;/strong&gt;, Oxford UP, 1996, p. 5: &amp;quot;. . . the characteristic attitude of the Pyrrhonists is one of&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt;, of being at a a loss, puzzled, stumped, stymied.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; &lt;em&gt;Aporia&lt;/em&gt; is not doubt.&amp;#0160; Doubt implies understanding, but &lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt; is a lack of understanding.&amp;#0160; The modern skeptic may doubt, but&amp;#0160;not the ancient skeptic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Connected with this is a distinction between&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;epoché&amp;#0160;&lt;/strong&gt;as the withholding of assent to the meaningfulness of a claim and suspension of judgment as to the truth or falsity of a claim.&amp;#0160; (Meaningfulness is a necessary condition of a claims&amp;#39;s being either true or false.) One can withhold assent from an assertion without granting that it makes sense; but if one suspends judgment then one has a clear propositional sense before one&amp;#39;s mind which one neither affirms nor denies.&amp;#0160; See Mates, p. 32.&amp;#0160; A good distinction!&amp;#0160; Add it to the list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee67c91200c-pi&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Trinity diagram&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee67c91200c img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c026bdee67c91200c-320wi&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;&quot; title=&quot;Trinity diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Consider, for example, this statement of the doctrine of the Trinity: &amp;quot;There is one God in three divine persons.&amp;quot; The epochist, to give him a name, takes no stand on the question whether the doctrinal formulation makes sense.&amp;#0160; He neither affirms nor denies that there is a proposition that the formula expresses.&amp;#0160; Propositions are the vehicles of&amp;#0160; the truth-values; so by practicing &lt;strong&gt;epoché&amp;#0160;&lt;/strong&gt;our epochist takes no stand on the question whether the doctrinal sentence expresses anything that is either true or false.&amp;#0160; The suspender of judgment, by contrast, grants that the sentence expresses a proposition but takes no stand on its truth or falsity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;So, strictly speaking,&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;is not doubt and&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;epoché&lt;/strong&gt; is not suspension of judgment.&amp;#0160; Close but not the same.&amp;#0160; One in the psychological state of &lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt; may or may not go on to practice &lt;strong&gt;epoché.&amp;#0160;&lt;/strong&gt;Suppose I am stumped by what you say. I might just leave it at that and not take the further step of performing &lt;strong&gt;epoché.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt; Mates describes is an attitude. But there is another&amp;#0160; sense of the term, a non-attitudinal sense, and I use it in this other propositional sense: an &lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt; is a propositional polyad, a set of two or more propositions that are individually plausible but jointly inconsistent.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;I also distinguish broad and narrow sub-senses of &lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt; in the second, the propositional, sense.&amp;#0160; What I just described is a propositional &lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt; in the broad sense. In the narrow, balls-to-the-wall sense, an &lt;em&gt;aporia&lt;/em&gt; is an absolutely insoluble problem set forth as a set of collectively inconsistent propositions each of which makes such a strong claim on our acceptance that it cannot be given up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alles klar?&lt;/em&gt; No way!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

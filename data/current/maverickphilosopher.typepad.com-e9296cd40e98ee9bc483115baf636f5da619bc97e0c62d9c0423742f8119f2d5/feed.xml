<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;I never thought I&amp;#39;d be quoting from &lt;em&gt;The Militant&lt;/em&gt;! A tip of the hat to &lt;a href=&quot;https://anthonygflood.com/&quot;&gt;Tony Flood&lt;/a&gt; who writes,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;I could consider making a tactical alliance with one who signs off with &amp;quot;The fight to defend constitutional liberties is at the center of the class struggle today.&amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #212529; font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;This is classic Marxism, not Antifa terrorism.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #212529; font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Populist democracy makes for strange bedfellows. This is true democracy, not Orwellian &amp;#39;democracy&amp;#39; which is the wokester&amp;#39;s name for &lt;em&gt;oligarchy&lt;/em&gt;. Why then am I not a socialist? Two reasons. First, socialism does not work economically. Second, because socialism runs counter to human nature and will not be freely adopted, socialism must be enforced. En&lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt;ment&amp;#0160; requires a massive state apparatus inimical to individual liberty. It would be interesting to do a comparison between totalitarian state socialism and &amp;#39;woke&amp;#39; capitalism. Both are totalitarian, anti-populist, and suppressive of individual freedoms such as freedom of speech and thought. (See fourth quotation below.) How then do they differ? &lt;a href=&quot;https://themilitant.com/2022/11/12/democrats-attacks-on-rights-at-heart-of-us-class-struggle/&quot;&gt;Excerpts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Throughout the final days of the 2022 campaign, Democrats centered their fire on former President Donald Trump. They claim “democracy itself” is threatened if he ever holds office again. Before Trump was even elected in 2016, Democrats unleashed the FBI against him — and against constitutional freedoms working people have won in blood and sorely need. They’ve used congressional witch hunts and launched a cascade of legal cases against him, his family members and political allies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Speeches by prominent Democrats make abundantly clear they will continue on this course whoever wins control of Congress. The real culprits responsible for Trump, they insist, are the millions of working people President Joseph Biden calls “semi-fascists” and believes can’t be trusted to make political decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The entirety of Biden’s prime-time Nov. 2 speech — his main address prior to the election — was to attack so-called MAGA Republicans as a “threat to democracy.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;[. . .]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Then in the Nov. 2 speech, Biden said Trump supporters threaten the rule of law, not because of what they do, but because of what they&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;think and say.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;This is an attack on freedom of speech itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;[. . .]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The only other issue Democrats campaigned around is abortion, built on false claims that the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling this summer outlawed it. But that isn’t true. It held abortion had no basis in the Constitution and returned the debate over the issue to the people and their elected representatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;[. . .]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Smear opponents as ‘foreign agents’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;From the beginning, one key theme of the Democrats’ assault on Trump and his administration was the utterly disproven charge that they were hooked up with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They got the FBI to put forward the Steele Dossier, a collection of gossip and smears paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign, to try and impeach Trump.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;m the chess guy hereabouts. A year ago I got a call from an 86-year-old retired chemist with an interest in the game. A meeting was arranged, a game was played, and then the talk turned to politics. The old man told us that he had voted for Biden out of revulsion at Trump. He said he had been a Republican all his life but lately became a Democrat. Brian and I were gentle with him, drawing him out to see how deep he&amp;#39;d dig his hole. It was deep enough for us to write him off as an utterly clueless old man living in the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Part of the problem with such people is that they live by a code of civility that will get you killed in the present-day political world should you dare to enter it.&amp;#0160; They don&amp;#39;t understand that the Left is at war with us, and leftists no longer hide the fact. Their stealth ideologues of, say, 10-15 years ago are now out in the open and brazen in their plans and proclamations. Leftists see politics as&amp;#0160; war, and if we don&amp;#39;t, we lose.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Brian and I are a couple of patzers, which is not to say that we won&amp;#39;t clean your clock at the local coffee house. We are &amp;#39;B&amp;#39; players (1600-1800) in the USCF hierarchy. The game with the old man turned into a training session. He acquitted himself so poorly we never heard from him again despite our welcoming manner.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;That is another fault of old men. Their outsized egos make them impermeable to instruction. They cannot stand to lose. But life is hierarchical and you will lose again and again and again. Wokesters with their promotion of &amp;#39;equity&amp;#39; (equality of outcome) and their assault on merit rail against life&amp;#39;s natural hierarchy, but to no ultimate avail. In the end, reality wins. With apologies to Ron DeSantis, reality is where &amp;#39;woke&amp;#39; goes to die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Substack&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://williamfvallicella.substack.com/p/relativism-and-dogmatism?sd=pf&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;My &lt;em&gt;Substack&lt;/em&gt; snowball is getting bigger and bigger. Time to monetize? Well, it&amp;#39;s a labor of love and I&amp;#39;ve got enough loot to last me my sublunary tenure, assuming the Dementocrat destruction of the economy is kept within certain bounds.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;I believe that &lt;em&gt;Enough is Enough&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to material stuff. Whatever we are here for, we are not here to pile up loot and land. You have heard it said that in the end a man needs only six feet. And not even that if the crematorium is his body&amp;#39;s last stop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;On the other hand, as foibled as we are psychologically, people tend to value more what they pay for. And if they are paying, then they may pay closer attention &amp;#39;to get their money&amp;#39;s worth.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Or maybe they think like this: &amp;quot;This guy gives away his content for free; he must not think it is worth much.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;On the third hand, If I sell a product, then I am in thrall to my customers and must cater to their wants and desires. This thrall thwarts my independence. I&amp;#39;m big on the latter.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;So you can expect my articles to stay free, free for me and free for thee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;This entry is relevant to my ongoing discussion with Dr. Buckner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;It is plain that &amp;#39;sees&amp;#39; has many senses in English.&amp;#0160; Of these many senses, some are philosophically salient.&amp;#0160; Of the philosophical salient senses, two are paramount.&amp;#0160; Call the one &amp;#39;existence-entailing.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160; (EE) Call the other &amp;#39;existence-neutral.&amp;#39; (EN)&amp;#0160; On the one, &amp;#39;sees&amp;#39; is a so-called verb of success.&amp;#0160; On the other, it isn&amp;#39;t, which not to say that it is a &amp;#39;verb of failure.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;EE:&amp;#0160; Necessarily, if subject S sees x, then x exists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;EN:&amp;#0160; Possibly, subject S sees x, but it is not the case that x exists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Now one question is whether both senses of &amp;#39;see&amp;#39; can be found in ordinary English.&amp;#0160; The answer is yes.&amp;#0160; &amp;quot;I know that feral cat still exists; I just now saw him&amp;quot; illustrates the first.&amp;#0160; &amp;quot;You look like you&amp;#39;ve just seen a ghost&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; illustrates the second.&amp;#0160; If I know that the feral cat exists on the basis of seeing him, then &amp;#39;sees&amp;#39; (or a cognate thereof) is being used in the (EE) sense as a &amp;#39;verb of success.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160; If ghosts do not exist, as I am assuming, then one who sees a ghost literally sees something that does not exist.&amp;#0160; We call this second sense of &amp;#39;sees&amp;#39; the phenomenological sense.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;So far, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve said anything controversial.&amp;#0160; I have simply pointed out two different senses and thus two different uses of &amp;#39;sees&amp;#39; in ordinary, non-philosophical English.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;We advance to a philosophical question, and embroil ourselves in controversy, when we ask whether, corresponding to the existence-neutral sense of &amp;#39;sees,&amp;#39; there is a type of seeing, a type of seeing that does not entail the existence of the object seen.&amp;#0160; One might grant that there is a legitimate use of &amp;#39;sees&amp;#39; (or a cognate thereof) in English according to which what is seen does not exist without granting that in reality there is a type of seeing that is the seeing of the nonexistent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;One might insist that all seeing is the seeing of what exists, and that one cannot literally see what does not exist.&amp;#0160; So, assuming that there are no ghosts, one cannot see a ghost.&amp;#0160; As Joe Biden might say, &amp;quot;Come on man, you can&amp;#39;t see what ain&amp;#39;t there!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;But suppose a sincere, frightened person reports that she has seen a ghost of such-and-such a ghastly description.&amp;#0160; Because of the behavioral evidence, you cannot reasonably deny that the person has had an&amp;#0160; experience, and indeed an object-directed (intentional) experience.&amp;#0160; You cannot deny, given her fear-indicating behavior, verbal and non-verbal, that she had a visual experience as of&amp;#0160; something ghastly. You cannot reasonably say, &amp;quot;Because there are no ghosts, your experience had no object.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; For it did have an object, indeed a material (albeit nonexistent) object having various ghastly properties. After all, she saw something, not nothing. Not only that, she saw something quite definite with definite properties.&amp;#0160; She didn&amp;#39;t see Casper the Friendly Ghost but a ghastly ghost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;You might object, &amp;quot;No, she merely thought she saw something.&amp;quot; But there was no thinking or doubting or considering going on; she &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; something and it scared the crap out of her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;This example suggests that we sometimes literally see what does not exist, and that seeing therefore does not entail the existence of that which is seen.&amp;#0160; If this is right, then the epistemologically primary sense of &amp;#39;see&amp;#39; is given by (EN) supra.&amp;#0160; If so, then problems arise for realism about the external world. For example, how do I know that the tree I see in good light (etc.) exists in itself whether or not I or anyone see it?&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://afteraristotle.net/2014/01/19/a-first-reply-to-the-maverick-philosophers-replies-to-my-seeing-and-the-existence-of-the-seen/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Henessey&amp;#39;s response&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;#0160; &amp;quot;I grant the reality of her experience, with the reservation that it was not an experience based in vision, but one with a basis in imagination, imagination as distinguished from vision.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; The point, I take it, is that what we have in my example of a person claiming to see a ghost is not a genuine case of seeing, of visual perception, but a case of imagining.&amp;#0160; The terrified person imagined a ghost; she did not see one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;I think Hennessey&amp;#39;s response gets the phenomenology wrong.&amp;#0160; Imagination and perception are phenomenologically different.&amp;#0160; For one thing, what we imagine is up to us: we are free to imagine almost anything we want; what we perceive, however, is not up to us.&amp;#0160; When&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh_fUMgFomk&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Ebeneezer Scrooge saw the ghost of Marley&lt;/a&gt;, he tried to dismiss the apparition as &amp;quot;a bit of bad beef, a blot of mustard, a fragment of an underdone potato,&amp;quot; but he found he could not.&amp;#0160; Marley: &amp;quot;Do you believe in me or not?&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; Scrooge: &amp;quot;I do, I must!&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; This exchange brings out nicely what C. S. Peirce called the compulsive character of perception.&amp;#0160; Imagination is not like this at all.&amp;#0160; Whether or not Scrooge saw Marley, he did not imagine him for the reason that the object of his experience was not under the control of his will.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The fact that what one imagines does not exist is not a good reason to to assimilate perception of what may or may not exist to imagination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Second, if a subject imagines x, then it follows that x does not exist.&amp;#0160; Everything imagined is nonexistent.&amp;#0160; But it is not the case that if a subject perceives x, then x does not exist.&amp;#0160; Perception either entails the existence of the object perceived, or is consistent with both the existence and the nonexistence of the object perceived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Third,&amp;#0160; one knows the identity of an object of imagination simply by willing the object in question.&amp;#0160; The subject creates the identity so that there can be no question of re-identifying or re-cognizing an object of imagination.&amp;#0160; But perception is not like this at all.&amp;#0160; In perception there is re-identification and recognition. Scrooge did not imagine Marley&amp;#39;s ghost for the reason that he was able to identify and re-identify the ghost as it changed positions in Scrooge&amp;#39;s chamber.&amp;#0160; So even if you balk at admitting that Scrooge saw Marley&amp;#39;s ghost, you ought to admit that he wasn&amp;#39;t imaging him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;I conclude that Hennessey has not refuted my example. To see a ghost is not to imagine a ghost, even if there aren&amp;#39;t any.&amp;#0160; Besides, one can imagine a ghost without having the experience that one reports when one sincerely states that one has seen a ghost.&amp;#0160; Whether or not this experience is perception, it surely is not imagination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;But I admit that this is a very murky topic!&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;They descended into hell and some rose again from the dead. Who am I to ask them any questions? Do I have the right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Craig was a housemate of mine in undergraduate days. When he was 18 he ran away from a troubled home and joined the Marine Corps. He ended up in Vietnam. One day I asked him what it was like. Distraught, he ran from the room. Later he told me the story. His platoon entered a village.&amp;#0160; After the fire fight, he alone was unscathed. Everyone else was either killed or badly wounded. Craig told me that as he walked toward what he thought would be certain death, he was overcome with a feeling of deep love for everybody and everything. In that &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaspers-stiftung.ch/de/karl-jaspers/grenzsituationen&quot;&gt;Grenzsituation&lt;/a&gt;, that boundary or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_situation&quot;&gt;limit situation&lt;/a&gt;, my friend perhaps glimpsed the world&amp;#39;s ultimate depth dimension, a peace surpassing all understanding in the eye of the storm of war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;To encroach with curiosity upon the liminality of such experiences shows a lack of respect.&amp;#0160; So now I ask no questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Mark Eli Kalderon and Charles Travis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;1 Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;This is a story of roughly a century of Oxford philosophy told by two outsiders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Neither of us has ever either studied or taught there. Nor are we specially privy to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;some oral tradition. Our story is based on texts. It is, moreover, a very brief, and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;very highly selective, story. We mean to trace the unfolding, across roughly the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;last century, of one particular line of thought—a sort of anti-idealism, and also a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;sort of anti-empiricism. By focussing in this way we will, inevitably, omit, or give&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;short shrift to, more than one more than worthwhile Oxford philosopher. We will&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;mention a few counter-currents to the main flow of 20th century Oxford thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;But much must be omitted entirely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Our story begins with a turn away from idealism. Frege’s case against idealism, so far as it exists in print, was made, for the most part, between 1893 (in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;preface to Grundgesetze volume 1) and 1918-1919 (in “Der Gedanke”). Within that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;same time span, at Oxford, John Cook Wilson, and his student, H.A. Prichard, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;developed, independently, their own case against idealism (and for what might&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;plausibly be called—and they themselves regarded as—a form of “realism”). Because of the way in which Cook Wilson left a written legacy it is difficult at best to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;give exact dates for the various components of this view. But the main ideas were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;probably in place by 1904, certainly before 1909, which marked the publication of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Prichard’s beautiful study, “Kant’s Theory of Knowledge”. It is also quite probably seriously misleading to suggest that either Cook Wilson or Prichard produced &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;a uniform corpus from the whole of their career—uniform either in content or in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;quality. But if we select the brightest spots, we find a view which overlaps with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Frege’s at most key points, and which continued to be unfolded in the main lines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;of thought at Oxford for the rest of the century.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frege’s main brief against idealism&lt;/strong&gt; could be put this way: &lt;strong&gt;It placed the scope &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;of experience (or awareness) outside of the scope of judgement.&lt;/strong&gt; In doing that, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;left us nothing to judge about. A central question about perception is: How can it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;make the world bear on what one is to think—how can it give me what are then &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;my reasons for thinking things one way or another? The idealist answer to that, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Frege showed, would have to be, “It cannot”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;BV: This is not at all clear. An example would be nice. Let me supply one. I see a tree. The seeing is a perceiving and this perceiving is a mental state of&amp;#0160; me, the perceiver.&amp;#0160; I see that the tree is green.&amp;#0160; Seeing that the tree is green I come&amp;#0160; to think that the tree is &amp;quot;one way or another,&amp;quot; e.g., green as opposed to not green.&amp;#0160; The authors seem to be asking the following question: How can perceiving something -- a tree in my example -- make the world give me the perceiver a reason for thinking the tree to be &amp;quot;one way or another,&amp;quot; green for example?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;This is a very strange question, one that has no clear sense.&amp;#0160; Or at least I don&amp;#39;t know what the authors are asking. If the question has no clear sense, then the supposedly idealist answer has no clear sense either. The authors are presumably defending some sort of realism about the objects of sense perception. If so, then it is not my perceiving that makes the world do anything. Their question ought to be: how do physical things in the external world, things that exist and have (most of) the properties they have independently of my or anyone&amp;#39;s perceivings, make our perceivings of these things have the content that they in fact have? How does the green tree over there bring it about that I am now having an experience &lt;em&gt;as of&lt;/em&gt; a green tree? Or is this perhaps the very question the authors are trying to ask their convoluted way?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;But let&amp;#39;s read on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;What, in Frege’s terms, “belongs &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;to the contents of my consciousness”—what, for its presence needs someone to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;be aware of it, where, further, that someone must be me—cannot, just in being as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;it is, be what might be held, truly, to be thus and so. (This is one point Prichard &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;retained throughout his career, and which, later on, he directed against others who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;he termed “sense-datum theorists”. It is also a point Cook Wilson directed, around &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;1904, against Stout (see section 4).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;BV:&amp;#0160; There is a solid point here, but it needs to be put clearly. The tree is in space and is green. No content of consciousness is in space or is green. Therefore, the tree is not a content of consciousness. This syllogism refutes a form of subjective or psychological idealism. But who holds it? Certainly not Kant. But let&amp;#39;s leave Kant out of the&amp;#0160; discussion for now. More important than Koenigsbergian exegesis is the deep and fascinating question of idealism versus realism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;What I said in the preceding paragraph needs a bit of refining. If I see a tree, then I am aware of something. That awareness-of or consciousness-of is an episode in my conscious, mental life.&amp;#0160; So it is appropriately referred to as a &amp;#39;content of consciousness.&amp;#39; Now consider that awareness-of just as such.&amp;#0160; (Of course, you cannot consider &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; awareness, but you can consider your own similar but numerically different awareness.) Is it green? No. It is colorless. The awareness-of, as such, is not the sort of &amp;#39;thing&amp;#39; that could have a color.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;The awareness of green is not a green awareness.&amp;#0160; If it were green it would have to be extended in space. No color without extension. But the awareness-of, though it is in time, is not in space.&amp;#0160; So here we have a content of consciousness that is neither colored nor in space.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;We should all will agree, then,&amp;#0160; that a perceiving &lt;em&gt;as of&lt;/em&gt; a green tree is not a green perceiving. This is so even if the perceiving is not merely &lt;em&gt;as of&lt;/em&gt; the tree, but &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; it in the sense that implies that there exists a tree that is being perceived. Again, all colors are extended in space. But no mental act is extended in space. Ergo, no mental act is colored. &lt;em&gt;A fortiori&lt;/em&gt; if mental a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;cts&amp;#0160; are as G. E. Moore once said, &amp;quot;diaphanous.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;What about the content of a mental act? It too is a &amp;#39;content of consciousness.&amp;#39; Macbeth had an hallucinatory visual experience as of a dagger. The dagger-appearance is what I am now calling the content. It is clearly distinct (though not separable) from the hallucinatory experiencing.&amp;#0160; The hallucinatory act/experiencing is not spatially extended.&amp;#0160; What about the dagger-appearance?&amp;#0160; Did it not seem extended to Macbeth? Don&amp;#39;t pink rats look to be extended in space by that drunks who hallucinate them? Yes they do.&amp;#0160; What we can say here is that while the dagger-appearance is phenomenologically extended, it is not extended in objective space.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;But there is a deeper reason for opposing subjective idealism. This I believe to be the solid point that Prichard makes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;If I judge a tree to be green, I judge it to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; green whether or not I or anyone so judge it.&amp;#0160; So if the tree &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; green, it is green in itself whether or not there are any perceivers.&amp;#0160; The point is quite general: to judge of anything x that it is F is to judge that it is F in itself whether or not there are any judgers. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter whether the judgment is true or false: a judgment that x is F &lt;em&gt;purports&lt;/em&gt; to lay bare the way things are independently of judgers, whether or not in fact things are as the judgment states.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;So if I say that the perceiving is green, I thereby commit myself to saying that the perceiving is green in itself whether or not there are any perceivers.&amp;#0160; But it is contradictory to maintain that something that can exist only as a content of consciousness, and thus cannot exist in itself, can also exist in itself apart from any consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;What I am calling &amp;#39;the solid point &amp;#39;puts paid to any form of idealism that identifies physical objects with contents of consciousness if those contents exist only in contingent minded organisms such as human animals.&amp;#0160; &amp;#0160;If there exists a tree that I perceive, it is as little in my consciousness as it is inside my head. But please note that the point just made presupposes the reality of the external world and thus begs the question against those forms of idealism that avoid the mistakes that subjective/psychological idealists make.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt; So, in particular, it was crucial to Frege that a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;thought could not be an idea (“Vorstellung”), in the sense of “idea” in which to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;one is to belong to someone’s consciousness. The positive sides of these coins are: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;all there is for us to judge about—all there is which, in being as it is might be a way &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;we could judge it to be—is that environment we all jointly inhabit; to be a thought &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;is, intrinsically, to be sharable and communicable. All these are central points in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Cook Wilson’s, and Prichard’s, Oxford realism. So, as they both held (early in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;the century), perception must afford awareness of, and relate us to, objects in our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;cohabited environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;BV: The authors seem to be saying that it is not about ideas, &lt;em&gt;Vorstellungen&lt;/em&gt;, contents of consciousness, etc. that we make judgments, but about the common physical environment in which we human animals live.&amp;#0160; This remains vague, however, if we aren&amp;#39;t told what &amp;quot;the environment&amp;quot; is.&amp;#0160; Do they mean particular things in the physical world, or are they referring to the physical world as a whole? And while it is true that thoughts (either Frege&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Gedanken&lt;/em&gt; or something very much like them) are communicable and thus sharable -- unlike contents of consciousness that are numerically different for numerically different people -- what does this have to do with &amp;quot;the environment&amp;quot;? Fregean and Frege-like thoughts are abstract objects; hence, not to be found in the physical &amp;quot;environment.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; Of course, for Frege, thoughts/propositions are not contents of consciousness; it does not follow, however, they are in the &amp;quot;environment.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; There are in Frege&amp;#39;s third realm, that of abstracta. (I promise to avoid tasteless jokes about the supposedly anti-Semitic Fege and the Third Reich.)&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;There is another point which Prichard, at least, shared with Frege. As Prichard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;put it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;There seems to be no way of distinguishing perception and conception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;as the apprehension of different realities except as the apprehension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;of the individual and the universal respectively. Distinguished in this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;way, the faculty of perception is that in virtue of which we apprehend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;the individual, and the faculty of conception is that power of reflection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;in virtue of which a universal is made the explicit object of thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;(Prichard, 1909, 44)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Compare Frege:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;A thought always contains something which reaches out beyond the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;particular case, by means of which it presents this to consciousness as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;falling under some given generality. (1882: Kernsatz 4) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;But don’t we see that the sun has set? And don’t we also thereby see &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;that this is true? That the sun has set is no object which emits rays &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;which arrive in our eyes, is no visible thing like the sun itself. That &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;the sun has set is recognized as true on the basis of sensory input. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;(1918: 64)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;For the sun to have set is a way for things to be; that it has set is the way things are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;according to a certain thought. A way for things to be is a generality, instanced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;by things being as they are (where the sun has just set). Recognizing its instancing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;is recognizing the truth of a certain thought; an exercise of a faculty of thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;By contrast, what instances a way for things to be, what makes for that thought’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;truth, does not itself have that generality Frege points to in a thought—any more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;than, on a different level, which Frege calls “Bedeutung”, what falls under a (first-level) concept might be the sort of thing things fall under. What perception affords &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;is awareness of the sort of thing that instances a way for things to be. Perception’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;role is thus, for Frege, as for Prichard, to bring the particular, or individual, in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;view—so as, in a favorable case, to make recognizable its instancing (some of) the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;ways for things to be it does. The distinction Prichard points to here is as fundamental both to him and to Frege as is, for Frege, the distinction between objects &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;and concepts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;BV: Now things are now getting interestingly &amp;#39;aporetic.&amp;#39; How do I know that the sun has set? I see the sun, and I see the horizon, but I don&amp;#39;t literally see (with my eyes) &lt;em&gt;that the sun has set&lt;/em&gt;. If the italicized words pick out an entity, it is an invisible one. As Frege says, &amp;quot;That the sun has set is no object that emits rays . . . .&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;How do I know that the tree is green? I see the tree, and I see green at the tree, but I don&amp;#39;t see &lt;em&gt;that the tree is green&lt;/em&gt;. Why not? Well, &amp;#39;That tree is green&amp;#39; is logically equivalent to &amp;#39;That green tree exists.&amp;#39; So if I can see that the tree is green, then I can see that the green tree exists. But existence is not empirically detectable. I can sense green, but I cannot sense existence. So I cannot see that the green tree exists.&amp;#0160; Therefore, I cannot see that the tree &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; green.&amp;#0160; Existence and property-possession are invisible. More generally, they are insensible, and not because of our sensory limitations, but because existence and property-possession are not empirically detectable by any manner of critter or by any device.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;And yet I know that the tree is green and I know that the sun has set. But how? Frege&amp;#39;s answer, &amp;quot;on the basis of sensory input&amp;quot; is lame.&amp;#0160; Sure, there has to be sensory input for me&amp;#0160; to know what I know in these cases, but how does it work? Such input is necessary, but it cannot be sufficient.&amp;#0160; Here is what Frege says in &lt;em&gt;Der Gedanke&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;Das Haben von Sinneseindruecken ist zwar noetig zum Sehen der Dinge, aber nicht hinreichend. Was noch hinzukommen muss, ist nichts Sinnliches. (&lt;em&gt;Logische Untersuchungen&lt;/em&gt;, 51)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;To be sure, the having of sensory impressions is necessary for seeing things, but not sufficient. What yet must be added is nothing sensory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;Necessary, because seeing (with the eyes) is a sensory function that cannot occur without sensory data, which is to say, sensory givenness, sensory input. Not sufficient, because what I need to know to know that that the tree &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; green, is that the physical individual/object does in reality instantiate the concept/property. The problem is that I cannot see the copulative linkage in the green tree any more than I can see the existence of the green tree. For again, to see either the linkage or the existence I would have to be able to sense them when there is no sensory awareness of either.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;What Frege adds that is not sensory is the thought/proposition. But this item is off by itself in a platonic &lt;em&gt;topos ouranios&lt;/em&gt;. How on Earth or in Plato&amp;#39;s Heaven can Fregean thoughts avail anything for the solution of our problem? To know that the tree is green in reality I need to know the sublunary unity of thing and property here below. How is that knowledge aided by the positing of a &amp;#39;ouranic&amp;#39; item, the thought/proposition, whose subject constituent is an abstract item as abstract as the thought itself? The Fregean thought brings together a subject-constituent, a sense, with a predicate-constituent, also a sense.&amp;#0160; It does not bring together the concrete tree and its properties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;What the authors say above on behalf of Frege and Prichard is thus no answer at all. We are told, &amp;quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;Perception’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;role is thus, for Frege, as for Prichard, to bring the particular, or individual, in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;view—so as, in a favorable case, to make recognizable its instancing (some of) the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 13pt;&quot;&gt;ways for things to be it does.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Are they joking?&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#0160; &lt;/span&gt;This glides right past the problem.&amp;#0160; What I need to know to know that the tree &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; green is the linkage or togetherness of individual and property in the thing in the external world. The thing is a this-such or a something-which. You cannot split the &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;such. &lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;You cannot split perception from conception assigning to the first the job of supplying bare individuals and assigning to the second the job of providing universals.&amp;#0160; For the problem, again, is &amp;#39;methectical,&amp;#39; a problem of &lt;em&gt;methexis&lt;/em&gt;: how do sensory individual and&amp;#0160; intelligible universal meet to form the sublunary this-such?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;Kant has an answer (whatever you think of it): the synthesis of individual and property/concept is achieved by the transcendental unity of apperception!&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;I will have more to say about this in a later post. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;To make good use of your time in this world, think of your life above all as a quest, a seeking, a searching, a striving. &amp;#0160;For what? &amp;#0160;For the ultimate in reality, truth, value, and for their existential appropriation. &amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;One appropriates reality by being authentic, truth by being truthful, values and norms by living them. &amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;It may all be absurd in the end, a &amp;quot;tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&amp;quot; &amp;#0160;But one cannot live well on the assumption that it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;So assume that it is not and seek the truth along all avenues of advance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Your message arrives at an opportune moment. The day before yesterday I received Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, &lt;em&gt;Christian Perfection and Contemplation: According to St. Thomas Aquinas and St. John of the Cross.&lt;/em&gt; Garrigou-Lagrange&amp;#39;s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;work is the real deal from perhaps the hardest of the hard-core paleo-Thomists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;While reading the chapter on infused contemplation, I thought of Thomas Merton. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Merton&amp;#39;s sense of the reality of the Unseen Order was weak and underdeveloped because of the strong lure of the secular -- to which, however, he never entirely succumbed, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;pace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;the thesis of David D. Cooper&amp;#39;s excellent but mistaken&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Thomas Merton&amp;#39;s Art of Denial: The Evolution of a Radical Humanist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt; (University of Georgia Press, 1989, 2008).&amp;#0160; Cooper attributed the evolution (devolution?) to Merton&amp;#39;s failure to achieve infused contemplation. As I read him, however, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Merton never lost his faith. He did, however, remain to the end deeply conflicted. All the Merton commentators that I have read agree that he came to question the &lt;em&gt;contemptus mundi&lt;/em&gt; he expressed in &lt;em&gt;The Seven Storey Mountain&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#0160; As for whether or not Merton attained infused contemplation, if he had why are there no references to it in his journal? There is a paucity of spiritual disclosure in those private pages of a monk who one would think would reveal the most intimate secrets of his inner life. I have read all seven volumes of his journal several times over. He is one of those key figures without whom you cannot understand the &amp;#39;Sixties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Thanks for the link.&amp;#0160; I read the Ellsberg-Sr. Wendy correspondence with interest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Regards,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Bill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

<title>Against H. A. Prichard and the 'Standard Picture' of Kant </title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2022/06/the-standard-picture-of-kants-idealism.html&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, drawing on the work of Henry E. Allison, I wrote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The standard picture opens Kant to the devastating objection that by limiting knowledge to appearances construed as mental contents he makes knowledge impossible when his stated aim is to justify the objective knowledge of nature and oppose Humean skepticism. Allison reports that Prichard &amp;quot;construes Kant&amp;#39;s distinction between appearances and things in themselves in terms of the classic example of perceptual illusion: the straight stick that appears bent to an observer when it is immersed in water.&amp;quot; (p. 6)&amp;#0160; But then knowledge is rendered impossible, and Kant is reduced to absurdity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Anyone who studies Kant in depth and in context and with an open mind should be able to see that his transcendental idealism is not intended as a subjective idealism. A related mistake is to think that subjective idealism is the only kind of idealism. The &amp;quot;standard picture&amp;quot; is fundamentally mistaken. Appearances (&lt;em&gt;Erscheinungen&lt;/em&gt;) for Kant are&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;the private data of particular minds, and thus&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;ideas in the Cartesian-Lockean sense, or any other sort of content of a particular mind. Kant distinguishes crucially between&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;Erscheinung&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;and&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;Schein/Apparenz&lt;/em&gt; between appearance and illusion/semblance. Because of this distinction, appearances [in the specifically Kantian sense] cannot be assimilated to perceptual illusions in the way Prichard and the &amp;quot;standard picture&amp;quot; try to assimilate them.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;In this entry I will expand upon the above by taking a close look at the stretch of text in H.A. Prichard&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Kant&amp;#39;s Theory of Knowledge&lt;/em&gt; (1909) in which he discusses the straight stick that appears bent when immersed in water.&amp;#0160; This is a classical example of perceptual illusion.&amp;#0160; It illustrates how an appearance (in one sense of the term) may distort reality (in one sense of the term).&amp;#0160; Call the first the A1 sense and the second the R1 sense. My claim, of course, is that this empirical A1-R1 distinction is not the same as Kant&amp;#39;s distinction between phenomena and things in themselves, and that anyone who, like Prichard, thinks otherwise has simply failed to understand what Kant is maintaining.&amp;#0160; Kant&amp;#39;s distinction between phenomena and things in themselves is the distinction between empirically real, intersubjectively accessible, public, causally interacting things in space and time, on the one hand, and those same things considered apart from the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; conditions of our sensibility.&amp;#0160; The Earth and its one natural satellite, the Moon, are examples of phenomena in Kant&amp;#39;s sense.&amp;#0160; Neither is a private, mental item in a particular mind as a modification of such a mind or an item internal to it. The Earth and the Moon are not mental phenomena in any Cartesian, Humean, or Brentanian sense, but empirically real, &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; things. But though they are empirically real, they are transcendentally ideal when considered independently of the conditions of our sensibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;In sum, there are two distinctions. The first is the distinction between private mental contents of particular minds and real things external to such minds. For example, Ed is enjoying a visual experience of his by-now-famous desk.&amp;#0160; Neither the desk as a whole nor any part of it is literally in Ed&amp;#39;s mind, let alone in his head. The desk, like his head and the rest of his body, is in the publicly accessible external world.&amp;#0160; Now let &amp;#39;A1&amp;#39; denote Ed&amp;#39;s experience/experiencing whereby his desk appears to him, and let &amp;#39;R1&amp;#39; denote the desk itself which is external to Ed&amp;#39;s mind/consciousness. Prichard&amp;#39;s mistake is to conflate this A1-R1 distinction with Kant&amp;#39;s distinction between phenomena and things in themselves. The R1 of the first distinction is the A2 of Kant&amp;#39;s distinction which, again, is the distinction between intersubjectively accessible objects in space and time and those same objects viewed independently of the conditions of our sensibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;I now turn to Chapter IV of Prichard&amp;#39;s book. The chapter is entitled &amp;quot;Phenomena and Things in Themselves.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; Prichard takes Kant to be saying that spatial and temporal relations are &amp;quot;relations which belong to things only as perceived.&amp;quot; (p. 79.)&amp;#0160; Prichard goes on to say, &amp;quot;The thought of a property or a relation that belongs to things as perceived involves a contradiction.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; He brings up the submerged stick which is in reality straight, but appears to a perceiver as bent. Prichard then makes the unexceptionable point that&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;. . . the assertion that something is so and so implies that it is so and so in itself, whether it be perceived or not, and therefore the assertion that something is so and so to us as perceiving, though not in itself, is a contradiction in terms.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;This is certainly true. After I explain why it is true, I will explain why it has nothing to do with Kant.&amp;#0160; One cannot assert of anything x that it is F without thereby asserting that x is F &lt;em&gt;in reality&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#0160; What one asserts to be the case one asserts to be the case whether or not anyone asserts it.&amp;#0160; (Of course, it doesn&amp;#39;t follow that what one asserts to be the case &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the case. All that follows is that what one asserts to be the case &lt;em&gt;purports&lt;/em&gt; to be the case independently of anyone&amp;#39;s act of assertion.&amp;#0160; Saying this I am merely unpacking the concept of assertion.) So if I assert of x that it is bent, then I assert that x is bent in itself or in reality whether or not there are any assertors or perceivers.&amp;#0160; To assert that x is bent is to assert that a mind-independent item is bent. (Of course, it does not follow that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a mind-independent item that is bent; all that follows is that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; some item is bent or straight or has any property, then it is mind-independent.) Therefore, if I assert of an illusory appearance that it is bent, then I fall into contradiction. For what I am then asserting&amp;#0160; is that something that is mind-dependent -- because it is illusory -- is not mind-dependent but exists in reality.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;This is what I take Prichard to be maintaining in the passage quoted. Thus charitably interpreted, what he is saying is (by my lights) true.&amp;#0160; But what does this have to do with Kant? Kant is not not talking about private mental items internal to particular minds such as an illusory appearance as of a bent stick. He is not saying of such an appearance (Apparenz) or semblance (Schein) that it is the subject of spatial and temporal relations.&amp;#0160; If he were, then he would stand refuted by Prichard&amp;#39;s unexceptionable point. But it strains credulity to think that a great philosopher could blunder so badly.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Note also that to read Kant as if his phenomena (&lt;em&gt;Erscheinungen&lt;/em&gt;) in space and time are private mental phenomena is to impute to him the sophomoric absurdity that mental data which are unextended are extended as they must be if they stand in physical relations. Such an imputation would be exegetically uncharitable &lt;em&gt;in excelsis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Finally, if space and time and everything in it is mental in Prichard&amp;#39;s sense, and internal to particular minds like ours, then the upshot would be an utterly absurd form of subjective idealism.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;...........................................&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Further tangential ruminations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;How do I know that the visual datum is an illusory appearance? If I know that what appears to me -- the immersed-stick visual datum -- is illusory, then I know that what appears to me cannot be bent or straight or have any spatial property. For what is illusory does not exist, and what does not exist cannot have properties. But how do I know that the visual datum does not exist?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;That is precisely what I don&amp;#39;t know in the cases of perceptual illusion in which I am really fooled -- unlike the classic stick case above that fools no adult. No adult is &amp;#39;taken in&amp;#39; by acquatic refraction phenomena. &amp;quot;Damn that boatman! He gave me a bent oar!&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; Here is a real-life example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c02af14a4c7e8200b-pi&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Crotalus atrox&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535ce1cf6970c02af14a4c7e8200b img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/.a/6a010535ce1cf6970c02af14a4c7e8200b-320wi&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;&quot; title=&quot;Crotalus atrox&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hiking in twilight, I experience a visual datum &lt;em&gt;as of&lt;/em&gt; a rattlesnake. I jump back and say to my partner, &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a rattler on the trail.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; I assert the visual datum to be a rattler, which of course implies that in reality there is a rattler.&amp;#0160; (And that I jumped back shows that my assertion was sincere.) A closer look, however, shows that I mistook a tree root for a snake. What I initially saw (in the phenomenological sense of &amp;#39;see&amp;#39;) was only an illusory appearance. If I then say that the illusory appearance is a rattler or is venomous, etc. then I fall into contradiction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The point is that illusory appearances do not exist and therefore cannot have properties: they cannot be bent or straight or venomous or of the species &lt;em&gt;crotalus atrox&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;An excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/2/2/207&quot;&gt;The Uphill Battle of Unpopular Ideas&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Regarding epistemic matters, many of those who identify themselves as progressives speak about “epistemic injustice” – the injustice that occurs when certain people, typically women and darker skinned people, are accorded less standing or authority as knowers or transmitters of knowledge. This is a profound and important concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The problem is that progressives have missed a key, but obvious, dimension to epistemic injustice. The more somebody is actually the victim of epistemic injustice, the less likely and less widely they are to be recognized as such. Indeed, the absence of that recognition is precisely what feeds the epistemic injustice. Not only are you not taken as seriously as you should be, but it is not widely recognized that this is the case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The corollary is that the more widespread the recognition of a particular manifestation of epistemic injustice is, the less likely it is that the purported victim actually is a victim. This is not a logical point but rather a psychological one. It is logically possible for X, Y, and Z to recognize that W is the victim of epistemic injustice while continuing to take W less seriously than W should be taken. Psychologically, however, those who regard W as a victim of epistemic injustice are more likely not to inflict that injustice themselves, either because they are sensitive to the potential problem or because they compensate (and not infrequently&amp;#0160;&lt;span class=&quot;html-italic&quot;&gt;over&lt;/span&gt;compensate) for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;One upshot of this is that while those espousing orthodox views are likely to be given more credence, even when the orthodox views are flawed, those expressing unpopular but well-founded views are likely to be given less credence than they should be given. That is a stark form of epistemic injustice – and one typically not recognized by those who are concerned about epistemic injustice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;html-p&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Even mentioning this comes at a risk. This is because there are orthodox views about who the victims of epistemic injustice are – and they do not include those who hold unorthodox views (for example, about epistemic injustice). Everybody can agree that it is unseemly to claim epistemic injustice when it does not exist. However, the difference between orthodox and unorthodox views about when this applies is that the orthodox views are, by definition, dominant. The point of this observation is not to elicit sympathy, but to articulate the ironies and paradoxes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;PRICHARD ON KANT: IN DEFENCE OF THE ANGLOSPHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;D.E. Buckner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;Bill Vallicella discusses &lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2022/06/the-standard-picture-of-kants-idealism.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; the ‘standard picture’ of Kant ’s transcendental idealism as a theory that affirms the unknowability of the ‘real’ (things in themselves) and relegates knowledge to the purely subjective realm of representations (appearances), adding that “P. F. Strawson and H. A. Prichard are exponents of this reading along with many others in the Anglosphere”. He argues that “Appearances (&lt;em&gt;Erscheinungen&lt;/em&gt;) for Kant are&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;the private data of particular minds, and thus&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; ideas in the Cartesian-Lockean sense, or any other sort of content of a particular mind. Kant distinguishes crucially between &lt;em&gt;Erscheinung&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Schein/Apparenz&lt;/em&gt;: between appearance and illusion/semblance.” He develops this theme in another post &lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2022/06/berkeleyan-and-kantian-idealism-how-do-they-differ.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in the context of Kant’s ‘rainbow argument’ (A45/B63).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;Bill does not explain the Anglospheric reading. In this post, I shall outline Prichard’s objection to the rainbow argument, as set out in &lt;em&gt;Kant’s Theory of Knowledge&lt;/em&gt; (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1909, pp. 94 ff). He objects, in effect, that the rainbow argument is an argument by analogy. Just as a rainbow is to the raindrops which create the illusion of a rainbow during a sunny shower, i.e. as appearance stands in relation to reality, so the raindrops are to the ‘things in themselves’. “Not only are the raindrops &lt;em&gt;mere appearances&lt;/em&gt;, but even their circular form, nay, even the space in which they fall, are nothing &lt;em&gt;in themselves&lt;/em&gt; but mere modifications or fundamental dispositions of our sensuous perception; the transcendental object [i.e. the thing in itself], however, remains unknown to us” (B62-3).&amp;quot; My emphasis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;But the analogy is a poor one. Prichard says (p.97) that we can only distinguish something as the &lt;em&gt;thing in itself&lt;/em&gt; from an &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt;, “so long as we mean by the thing in itself what Kant normally means by it, viz. something which exists independently of perception and is not an appearance at all.” I.e., the relation between rainbow and raindrops is not analogous to that between raindrops and things in themselves, because ‘thing in itself’ signifies something absolute and not relative, namely what the scholastics called a &lt;em&gt;per se being&lt;/em&gt;, a thing that exists independently of any other thing, and particularly of any sentient thing. If a raindrop really is a &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; being, then it exists independently of any other such being, so cannot be an appearance &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; something. If on the other hand it is not a &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; being, then the analogy collapses: we cannot say that &lt;em&gt;just as&lt;/em&gt; a rainbow stands to raindrops, &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; raindrops stand to raindrops-in-themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;Kant’s argument thus depends on a sleight of hand. “He reaches it by a transition which at first sight seems harmless … while he states the problem in the form ‘Are things in themselves spatial or are they only spatial as appearing to us?’ he usually states the conclusion in the form ‘Space is the form of phenomena’, i. e. phenomena are spatial. A transition is thereby implied from ‘things as appearing’ to ‘appearances’” (pp. 73-4).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;Underlying the mistake, says Prichard, is the identification of &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;judgement&lt;/em&gt;. Our apprehension of what things are is essentially a matter of thought or judgement, and not of perception. “We do not&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;perceive&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;but&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;a thing as it is”. For example, the proposition “the portion of the great circle joining two points on the surface of a sphere is the shortest way between them via the surface” expresses a judgment that is valid for everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt; Kant, however, treats the judgement as a&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt;; for if we apply his general assertion to this instance, we find him saying that what we judge the portion of the great circle to be essentially belongs to the&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;of it, and is valid for the&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;sensuous&lt;/em&gt; faculty of every&amp;#0160; human being, and that thereby it can be distinguished from what belongs to the same perception of a great circle accidentally, e. g. its apparent colour, which is valid only for a particular organization of this or that sense. In this way he correlates what the great circle really is, as well as what it looks, with perception, and so is able to speak of what it is for perception. But, in fact, what the great circle is, is correlated with thought, and not with perception; and if we raise Kant’s transcendental problem in reference not to perception but to thought, it cannot be solved in Kant’s agnostic manner. For it is a presupposition of thinking that things are &lt;em&gt;in themselves&lt;/em&gt; [my emphasis] what we think them to be; and from the nature of the case a presupposition of thinking not only cannot be rightly questioned, but cannot be questioned at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;Simply put, a proposition is true or false depending on whether it agrees with reality or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;&quot;&gt;As I shall argue elsewhere, this ‘Anglospheric’ point by Prichard marks a turning point in the philosophy of perception, indeed in philosophy itself. For nearly 300 years, beginning with the discovery of Descartes and others that the process of vision begins with the retinal image, the focus of philosophy was on perception, i.e. images, and not on language. Indeed, it is hard to find any informed linguistic analysis in the writing of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, Kant and other. Church regarded Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; as marking the very lowest point of the history of logic. In the twentieth century Anglosphere, by contrast, the philosophy of perception is marked by a ‘linguistic turn’ to focus on language and philosophical logic. But that is a separate issue, as is the question of why philosophy on the Continent, much or all of it in the tradition that originates with Brentano and Husserl, took such a different turn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ll leave it to you to work out why. Or else just listen to Tulsi&amp;#39;s commentary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<title>Fetterman Unfettered: Against Ableism</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, John Fetterman is currently competing with Dr. Mehmet Oz for a seat in the U. S. Senate. Any objective person who observes both men in action can see that Fetterman is mentally, morally, and politically unfit for office.&amp;#0160; (I won&amp;#39;t comment on the &amp;#39;hoodie,&amp;#39; the ugly forearm tattoos, the neck bulge, the man&amp;#39;s lack of a career outside of politics, or his &amp;#39;anti-gravitas&amp;#39;: the man&amp;#39;s overall thuggish appearance.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Mentally, he has trouble formulating clear sentences.&amp;#0160; A recent stroke has left him impaired. Morally, he is a brazen liar: he recently stated in a debate with Dr. Oz that he supports fracking when it is obvious from his previous assertions and his overall position that he does not. Politically, he supports destructive hard-Left positions with respect to drugs and crime and everything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;But let&amp;#39;s say you believe in &amp;#39;equity&amp;#39; as wokesters use the word. You believe in equality of outcome and proportional representation regardless of merit and qualifications.&amp;#0160; If &amp;#39;equity&amp;#39; is your concern why shouldn&amp;#39;t a stroke-impaired man be a U. S. senator? After all, if dementia is no bar to high office, why should stroke-impairment be?&amp;#0160; Fetterman&amp;#39;s fit with the Biden bunch couldn&amp;#39;t be tighter. To demand qualifications for high office or for any job at all is to discriminate against the unqualified, and we now know that discrimination is among the worst of sins. We are all equal and the supposed accomplishments and talents of Dr. Oz the heart surgeon really ought to count for nothing in an equitable society. We have made progress in the &amp;#39;progressive&amp;#39; sense of the term. And we are better people for it.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The disabled are just as qualified as the rest of us. For they are not really disabled at all; they are &lt;em&gt;differently abled&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#0160; I myself was born with only one functioning ear. But this birth defect gives me the ability to block out sound in bed by putting my good ear down on the pillow. Clearly, this wonderful ability of mine compensates for all of the drawbacks of monaural hearing such as the inability to tell from which direction a sound is coming. The point generalizes: &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; disabilities are really abilities in disguise. No one should ever be evaluated in any way on the basis of supposed &amp;#39;talents&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;qualifications&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;abilities&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;accomplishments.&amp;#39; What I said in my first paragraph convicts me of the thought crime of &amp;#39;ableism.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160; I ought to check myself into the nearest &amp;#39;progressive&amp;#39; re-education camp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;A tip of the hat to Dmitri Dain for sending us &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3713966-arizonas-libertarian-senate-candidate-dropping-out-of-race-endorsing-masters/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where we read:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Libertarian Marc Victor dropped out of Arizona’s closely watched Senate race on Tuesday, encouraging voters to cast their ballots for Republican&amp;#0160;&lt;span class=&quot;person-popover&quot; data-nid=&quot;112018&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;person-popover__link&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/people/blake-masters/&quot;&gt;Blake Masters&amp;#0160;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;in his challenge to Sen.&amp;#0160;&lt;span class=&quot;person-popover&quot; data-nid=&quot;31182&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;person-popover__link&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/people/mark-kelly/&quot;&gt;Mark Kelly&amp;#0160;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(D).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Polls had shown Victor garnering support in the low single digits, but his small bloc of supporters could provide a critical boost to Masters, as surveys show the Republican only trailing Kelly by a few percentage points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;“Don’t vote for Marc Victor for Senate, vote for Blake Masters,” Victor said on Tuesday. “Blake’s in a very tight race here with Mark Kelly, and I want to see him win.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Victor met virtually with Masters prior to dropping out of the race and&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ismjOQNzsIA&quot;&gt;posted a video of their roughly 20-minute conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Hats off to Marc Victor for his good sense. To vote for him would have been utter folly since it is (a) certain that he would not have been elected and (b) certain that he would have siphoned off votes needed by the impressive Blake Masters to defeat the disgusting Mark Kelly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Once more: politics is a practical game. Without the power to implement your policies, they are nothing but hot air and paper. Don&amp;#39;t throw away your vote on unelectables. Don&amp;#39;t confuse a political party with a discussion society.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Marc&amp;#0160; Victor is a local gun guy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GenVQQoAu6k&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is one of his videos. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XucT-fBZnXE&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is another. He talks sense!&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Libertarian Party is for losers. If you are a conservative who votes Libertarian, you are a damned fool. You say you stand on &amp;#39;principles&amp;#39;? Principles are great. And some of the Libertarian ones are salutary. But principles without power are just paper.&amp;#0160; Politics is a practical game. Wise up and get with the program. Don&amp;#39;t throw away your vote on unelectables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;You have heard me say many times that politics is a practical game. I don&amp;#39;t mean that it is unserious. Some games are serious; chess is one, life is another. Life is as serious as cancer, and the wrong people in power can put a serious dent in your living of your life.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<title>Three Axes of Conflict</title>
<link>https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2022/10/three-axes-of-conflict.html</link>

<description>Antony Beevor in The Spanish Civil War (Orbis 1982, Penguin 2001, p. 279) writes that in the aftermath of the war both sides engaged in gross simplifications for propaganda purposes: As a result, the three axes of conflict (left-right, centralist-regionalist,...</description>
<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Antony Beevor in &lt;em&gt;The Spanish Civil War&lt;/em&gt; (Orbis 1982, Penguin 2001, p. 279) writes that in the aftermath of the war both sides engaged in gross simplifications for propaganda purposes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;As a result, the three axes of conflict (left-right, centralist-regionalist, and authoritarian-libertarian) have often been crudely amalgamated, leaving the ferocity of the war partly unexplained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Philosophers do well to study history to offset their penchant for the bird&amp;#39;s-eye view.&amp;#0160; They need to come to ground from time to time if only to fuel themselves for further flight. Feasting on the carrion of fact, however, is not particularly nutritious. So what caught this philosopher&amp;#39;s eye was the three-axes schema. Philosophers love &lt;em&gt;schemata&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#0160; They love the synoptic and panoptic survey. &amp;#39;Spectators of all time and existence . . . .&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The three-axes schema strikes me as relevant to the current political war in the USA as we teeter on the brink of World War Three thanks to the stupidity and criminality of the Democrat Party and the useful idiots who support it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;1) &lt;em&gt;Left-Right.&lt;/em&gt; It might be useful to distinguish between the Old Left, the New Left, and the &amp;#39;Woke&amp;#39; Left. (Having sneered, I now drop the sneer quotes, at least for the space of this paragraph.) What distinguishes the Woke Left is corporate capitalism, the globalist capitalism of mega-corporations with the economic, and in consequence thereof political, clout to bend both government and the Fourth Estate to their collective will, thereby destroying the independence of both of the latter and eliminating checks on their unbalanced power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;Centralism-Regionalism.&lt;/em&gt; Liberty versus tyranny defines the battle for the soul of America.&amp;#0160; Tyranny emanates from the central government which, while endlessly mouthing &amp;#39;democracy&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;rule of law&amp;#39; respects neither. Liberty, if it can survive, will be defended locally and regionally by citizens with the civil courage to speak out and face &amp;#39;cancellation&amp;#39; and worse. (I am thinking, among other things, of ordinary citizens who attend school board meetings and protest being labelled &amp;#39;domestic terrorists&amp;#39; for rejecting the indoctrination of their children in Critical Race Theory, in 1619-type historical revisionism, in transgender ideology, and in anti-Caucasian ethno-masochism.) Regionalism is or is closely related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2010/07/can-federalism-save-us.html&quot;&gt;federalism&lt;/a&gt;. (The overturning of Roe v. Wade scored a point for the latter; the Left&amp;#39;s febrile outrage clearly demonstrates its anti-federalism and anti-democratic spirit. )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;3) &lt;em&gt;Authoritarian-Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;. American conservatism is not authoritarian but classically liberal. But while &lt;em&gt;classically&lt;/em&gt; liberal, and thus opposed to throne-and-altar paleo-conservatism, it also opposes the anti-religionism and anti-traditionalism of the Left, especially that of the &amp;#39;woke&amp;#39; Left, which is a particularly virulent and lethal strain of leftism. It thus treads the &lt;em&gt;via media&lt;/em&gt; avoiding both the Road to Serfdom (you get the allusion, of course) and the road to anarchy as lately instantiated by Atifa black shirts and BLM Marxist thugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;That something so obvious needs to be stated explicitly shows how far we have fallen.&amp;#0160; But precisely because we have fallen so far, Tulsi Gabbard is to be applauded for having courageously stated it. That it should take &lt;em&gt;courage&lt;/em&gt; to state something so obvious is yet another index of our social decline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;And now, if you can spare ten minutes, listen to Chloe Cole&amp;#39;s story at 47:15-57:50.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<title>Animal Awareness: Aristotle, Galileo, Kant</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Aristotle: Even if all animals were eliminated and thereby all perceptions (since only animals perceive), “there will still be something perceptible—a body, for example, or something warm, or sweet, or bitter, or anything else perceptible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;BV: Evaluation of the above requires that we get clear about the sense of &amp;#39;perceptible.&amp;#39; There are at least the following three senses:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;1) X is perceptible&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =&lt;sub&gt;df&lt;/sub&gt; it is logically possible that x be perceived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;2) X is perceptible&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;=&lt;sub&gt;df&lt;/sub&gt; it is nomologically possible that x be perceived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;3) X is perceptible&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; =&lt;sub&gt;df&lt;/sub&gt; x is able to be perceived by some sentient being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;I suggest that (3) is what we normally mean by &amp;#39;perceptible.&amp;#39;&amp;#0160; What (3) says is that for a thing to be perceptible, there must be at least one existing perceiver with the ability to perceive the thing.&amp;#0160; On (3), then, Aristotle is mistaken. So on a charitable interpretation, he probably means something like (2): many if not most natural things are such that, if there were an able-facultied perceiver on the scene, one or more natural things would be perceived, and would be perceived as having &lt;em&gt;in themselves&lt;/em&gt; such qualities as being warm, bitter, or sweet. Aristotle is a realist about what we now call secondary qualities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Galileo: “tastes, odors, colors, and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we place them is concerned, and that they reside only in the consciousness. Hence&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;if the living creature were removed&lt;/em&gt;, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;BV: Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) belongs to the modern period which he helped inaugurate, along with Rene Descartes (1596-1650).&amp;#0160; &amp;#0160;The main point to note for present purposes is that Galileo reduces the sensory qualities that Aristotle viewed as properties of things themselves to perceiver-relative &amp;#39;secondary qualities.&amp;#39; So if &amp;quot;living creatures were removed,&amp;quot; then at least the secondary qualities would be &amp;quot;removed&amp;quot; along with them. That&amp;#39;s quite the contrast with Aristotle.&amp;#0160; The Stagirite is a realist about warmth, etc,; the Italian is an idealist about warmth, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;What would Kant’s view be? Does he think that if all perceiving beings ceased to exist, then appearances would cease to exist? But appearances, according to him, are things like trees and rocks. Does he then think that if all perceiving beings ceased to exist, trees and rocks, and all other non-sentient things, would cease to exist? We should be told.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;BV:&amp;#0160; Underlying Ed&amp;#39;s questions is the question: Who or what is the knowing subject for Kant?&amp;#0160; For Aristotle, the knowing subject is the concrete man embedded in nature, a hylomorphic composite in which &lt;em&gt;anima forma corporis&lt;/em&gt;. For Kant, however, the concrete man, the man of flesh and blood embedded in nature, with both animal body and animal soul, is &lt;em&gt;blosse Erscheinung&lt;/em&gt;, a mere appearance or phenomenon, and thus an object of knowledge, but not the subject of knowledge, i.e., not the knowing subject.&amp;#0160; For Kant, the knowing subject is transcendental.&amp;#0160; This is Kant&amp;#39;s view whatever you think of it. It is undoubtedly fraught with difficulties, but my sketch is accurate albeit superficial.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;yiv9669569525MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;And so the answer to both of Ed&amp;#39;s questions is in the negative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

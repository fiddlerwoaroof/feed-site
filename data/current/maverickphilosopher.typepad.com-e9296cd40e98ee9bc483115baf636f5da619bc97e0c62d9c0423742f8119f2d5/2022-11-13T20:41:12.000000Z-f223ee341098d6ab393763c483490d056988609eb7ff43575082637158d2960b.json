  "content":"<p><span><em>Substack</em> <a href=\"https://williamfvallicella.substack.com/p/relativism-and-dogmatism?sd=pf\">latest</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span>My <em>Substack</em> snowball is getting bigger and bigger. Time to monetize? Well, it's a labor of love and I've got enough loot to last me my sublunary tenure, assuming the Dementocrat destruction of the economy is kept within certain bounds. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>I believe that <em>Enough is Enough</em> when it comes to material stuff. Whatever we are here for, we are not here to pile up loot and land. You have heard it said that in the end a man needs only six feet. And not even that if the crematorium is his body's last stop.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>On the other hand, as foibled as we are psychologically, people tend to value more what they pay for. And if they are paying, then they may pay closer attention 'to get their money's worth.'</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Or maybe they think like this: &quot;This guy gives away his content for free; he must not think it is worth much.&quot;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>On the third hand, If I sell a product, then I am in thrall to my customers and must cater to their wants and desires. This thrall thwarts my independence. I'm big on the latter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>So you can expect my articles to stay free, free for me and free for thee.</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://ecp.yusercontent.com/mail?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstackcdn.com%2Fimage%2Ffetch%2Ff_auto%2Cq_auto%3Abest%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fwilliamfvallicella.substack.com%252Fapi%252Fv1%252Fpress_kit%252F84343657.jpg%253FbgImage%253Dtrue%2526textColor%253D%252523ffffff%2526hash%253D308662517%2526version%253D9&amp;t=1668370680&amp;ymreqid=539185a9-86c9-e1c1-2f2c-5a00a1016700&amp;sig=oh6EupGVeonXDTpihqa6tw--~D\"></p>"

  "content":"<p><span>Robert Paul Wolff <a href=\"https://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-reply-to-inquiry_27.html\">here</a> replies with wit and lefty snark to a charming request by one Pamela N., a personal assistant, who wants to know who Immanuel Kant is referring to when he writes, &quot;Caius is a man; man is mortal; therefore, Caius is mortal.&quot;  Pamela confesses,</span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>I will admit, I have not read Kant's works. I have, however, spent the last couple of hours combing through post after post after post about this particular quote from the book and cannot find a single soul who would say who they think Caius is.</span><br><br><span>In reading these many posts, I have come to the conclusion that Kant is probably referring to Pope Caius as he has been venerated by the Catholic Church as a Saint. Given that title, and the fact that Saint's [sic] are given to [sic] a quasi-immortal status [sic], I have ascertained that this is who Kant is most likely referring to. My question for you is, do you think that my assumption is correct? or do you have a deeper insight into who he is referring to?</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>"

  "content":"<p><span><span>Arm yourself with your maxims as you quit your cell. They are as important as your <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/beginners-guide-to-edc/\">EDC</a>.

Smile and greet, but pass on. Restrain the social need -- if it is a need. Keep the past at mental arm's length.Â  Live in the present, relaxed, but situationally aware. Guard the mind. Protect the inner citadel from pointless and harmful invasions.</span></span></p>"

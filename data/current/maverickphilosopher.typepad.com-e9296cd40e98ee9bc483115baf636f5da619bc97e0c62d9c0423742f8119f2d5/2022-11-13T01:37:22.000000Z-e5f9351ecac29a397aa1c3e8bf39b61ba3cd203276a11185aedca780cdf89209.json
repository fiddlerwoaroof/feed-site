  "content":"<p><span>&quot;A <strong>torch song</strong> is a sentimental love song, typically one in which the singer laments an unrequited or lost love, where one party is either oblivious to the existence of the other, or where one party has moved on.&quot; (Wikipedia)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Sarah Vaughn, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9I_clmG8Eo\">Broken Hearted Melody</a>.   YouTuber comment: &quot;<span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\">Late 1959. I was in 4th grade, listening to KFWB Los Angeles.&quot;  Same here. Same year, same grade, same station, KFWB, Channel 98! Color Radio! My favorite deejay was <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0715307/bio\">B. Mitchel Reed</a>.  I learned 'semolian' and 'mishigas' from him. His real surname is '</span><span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\">Goldberg,' which means <em>mountain of gold</em>. I will say no more lest I provoke my alt-Right correspondents.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Timi Yuro, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPy-Memj0vE\">Hurt. </a>When I first heard this I was sure <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1889469/bio\">she</a> was black. I was wrong. She's Italian, and her real name is Rosemarie Timotea Auro. What pipes!</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Billie Holliday, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPJuFxl0bxY\">The Very Thought of You</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Roy Orbison, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8Jz3VW7rYk\">In Dreams</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Peggy Lee, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGV0mNb0SPw\">Oh You Crazy Moon</a> </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Ketty Lester, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG7rXv-3phA\">Love Letters</a> </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Etta James, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cbOl96RFM\">At Last</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cbOl96RFM\"> </a> </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Lenny Welch, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPQnIMjOL14\">Since I Fell for You</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Sentimental you say? What would life be without sentiment? You say it's overdone? You suffer from an excess of cool. It's Saturday night, punch the clock, pour yourself a stiff one, and <em>feel</em>. Tonight we feel, tomorrow we think.  About sentimentality and everything else under the sun.</span></p>"

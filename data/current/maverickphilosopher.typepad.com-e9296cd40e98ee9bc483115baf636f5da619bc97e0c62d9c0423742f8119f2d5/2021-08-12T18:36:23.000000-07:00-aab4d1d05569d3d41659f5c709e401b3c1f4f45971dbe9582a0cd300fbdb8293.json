  "content":"<p><span>Returning to the <a href=\"https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2021/08/the-third-way-of-the-ostrich.html#comments\">ongoing thread</a>:</span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>So to summarise the discussion so far. The doctrine of <em>Reference and Identity</em> is that empty names can refer. That is because the verb phrase ‘refers to’ is <em>intentional</em>. That is, “S refers to N” is consistent with “there is no such thing as N”. Contrast with “S touches N” which implies there is such a thing as N.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[. . .]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Do you see any problem with that position?</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><span>When you say, &quot;empty names can refer,&quot; do you mean that some empty names refer and some empty names do not refer? Or do you mean that all empty names refer? (Compare: </span><span>If I said that integers can be either odd or even, that would be equivalent to saying that  some integers are odd and some are even.)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>I will assume that you mean that all empty names refer.  You say that this is because 'refers to' is intentional. It is intentional in the very same way that thinking-of is intentional. To think is to think of something. But 'A thinks of  N' is logically consistent with 'there is no such thing as N.'  If I am thinking of Asmodeus, it does not follow that I am thinking of something that exists.  So far, so good. Now I take it that you hold that the following are all logically equivalent where the substituends for 'N' are proper names such as 'Moses' and 'Asmodeus.' </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>There is no such thing as N</span></li>\r\n<li><span>There exists no such thing as N</span></li>\r\n<li><span>It is not the case that there exists an x such that x = N</span></li>\r\n<li><span>It is not the case that some existing thing is identical to N</span></li>\r\n<li><span>It is not the case that something is identical to N</span></li>\r\n<li><span>No existing thing is identical to N</span></li>\r\n<li><span>Nothing is identical to N</span></li>\r\n<li><span>N is not a member of the class K of existing things.</span></li>\r\n<li><span>N is not a member of class K of things.  </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span>You are making the following additional assumptions. Everything exists. (Quine contra 'Wyman.') 'Is' and 'exists' have the same sense. 'Existential quantifier' and 'particular quantifier' are two different names for one and the same quantifier.  'N does not exist' says just this: it is not the case that something is identical to N.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Your view implies a contradiction:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>1) Empty names such as 'Asmodeus' refer. (R &amp; I, 9-10)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>2) To refer is to refer to something. (R &amp; I, 9-10)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Therefore</span></p>\r\n<p><span>3) 'Asmodeus' refers to something. (As you explicitly state, <em>ibid</em>.)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>4) In the case of 'Asmodeus,' an empty name, 'Asmodeus'  refers to something that does not exist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>5) Everything exists.  (There are no nonexistent things. 'Something does not exist' is contradictory.)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Therefore</span></p>\r\n<p><span>6) 'Asmodeus' refers to nothing.  (3, 4, 5)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Therefore</span></p>\r\n<p><span>7) (3) and (6) are contradictories.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Therefore</span></p>\r\n<p><span>8) One of your assumptions is false.</span><span> </span></p>"

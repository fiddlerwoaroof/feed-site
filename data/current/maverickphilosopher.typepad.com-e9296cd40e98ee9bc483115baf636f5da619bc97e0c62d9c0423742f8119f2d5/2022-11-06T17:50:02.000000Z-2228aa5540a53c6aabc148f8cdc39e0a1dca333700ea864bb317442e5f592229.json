  "content":"<p><span>To make good use of your time in this world, think of your life above all as a quest, a seeking, a searching, a striving.  For what?  For the ultimate in reality, truth, value, and for their existential appropriation.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span>One appropriates reality by being authentic, truth by being truthful, values and norms by living them.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span>It may all be absurd in the end, a &quot;tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&quot;  But one cannot live well on the assumption that it is.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So assume that it is not and seek the truth along all avenues of advance.</span></p>"

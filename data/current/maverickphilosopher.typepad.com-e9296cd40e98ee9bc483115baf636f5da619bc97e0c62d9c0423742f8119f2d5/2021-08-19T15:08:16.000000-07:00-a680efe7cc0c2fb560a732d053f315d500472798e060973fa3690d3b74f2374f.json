  "content":"<p><span>The following argument appears valid:</span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>Some deity is called 'Zeus.'</span><br><span>Zeus is wise.</span><br><span>Therefore, some deity called 'Zeus' is wise. (D. E. Buckner, <em>Reference and Identity</em>, 118)</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><span>Now if an argument is valid, it is valid in virtue of its logical form.  What is the logical form of the above argument? The following argument-form, Buckner correctly states, is invalid:</span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>Ex Fx<br>Ga<br>Ex (Fx &amp; Gx)</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><span>So if the form just depicted is the only available form of the original argument, then the validity of the argument cannot be simply a matter of logical form. And this is what Buckner concludes: &quot;</span><span>It is clearly the anaphoric connection between the premisses that makes the argument valid, but no such connection exists in the formalized version of the argument. &quot;(119)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Buckner seems to be arguing as follows:</span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>a) The original argument is valid. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>b) The only form it could possibly have is the one depicted above.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>c) The argument-form depicted is plainly invalid.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Therefore</span></p>\r\n<p><span>d) The validity of the original argument cannot be due to its logical form, but must be due to the anaphoric connection between its premises.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><span>I do not find this argument rationally compelling. (b) is rejectable.  I suggest that the original argument is an enthymeme the logical form of which is the following:</span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>1) For some x, x is called 'a.'<br>2) For any x, if x is called 'a,' then x =a.<br>3) a is G.<br>Therefore<br>4) For some x, (x is called 'a' and x is G).</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>"

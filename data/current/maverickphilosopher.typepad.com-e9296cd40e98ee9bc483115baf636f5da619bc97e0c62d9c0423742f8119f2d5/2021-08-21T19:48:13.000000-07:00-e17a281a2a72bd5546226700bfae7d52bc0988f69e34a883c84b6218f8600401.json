  "content":"<p><span>As promised <a href=\"https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2021/08/saturday-night-at-the-oldies-my-bob-dylan-top-ten.html\">last week</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akJQX1N65G4\">Baby Let Me Follow You Down</a>, 1962. From Bob's first album. Lord almighty it is good to hear this again. Dylan played better guitar and harmonic in the early days.  The surging, full-throated harp beats the sometimes-annoying tweets and toots of his later harmonic playing.  Dylan opens by telling us that he learned this song from Rick [Eric] von Schmidt when he met him one day in &quot;the green pastures of Harvard University.&quot; Was he thinking of Woody Guthrie's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH2DJvgNlMA\">Pastures of Plenty</a>, 1944? Dylan's effort  apparently derives from von Schmidt's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ooGMnNPOeE\">Baby Let Me Lay it on You</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Here is a real gem of a find: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYIFmHvaqjU\">Bob Dylan Jamming with Eric von Schmidt</a>, May, 1964.  Eric von Schmidt, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHCfRDKa0U\">Envy the Thief</a>. Back to the Dylan top ten.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMFj8uDubsE\">Blowin' in the Wind</a>. From the <em>Freewheelin'</em> album, Bob's second. His best civil rights anthem. Topical but allusive.</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5al0HmR4to\"><span>A Hard Rain's A-</span></a><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5al0HmR4to\">Gonna Fall</a>. Also from The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.  Said to have been written during the Cuban Missile Crisis, October 1962. I remember it like it was yesterday.  Joan Baez's transcendently beautiful <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMalmwupji8\">cover</a>. Forgive me if I gush a bit. I'm enjoying a Saturday night cocktail: Tequila + Aperol. Straight up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aehwEu8SBSo\">Positively Fourth Street</a>. The ultimate put-down song.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y2FuDY6Q4M\">With God on Our Side</a>. From the third album.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><em>Spanish Harlem Incident</em>. Fourth album, We'll make do with the Byrds' <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G3s1vpiSx0\">cover</a>. Not that it isn't good.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4HW33SgZlM\">Its All Over Now, Baby Blue</a>. Fifth album, probably my favorite.  This one goes out to Charaine H., and our bittersweet relationship.</span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you<br></span><span>Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you <br>The vagabond who's rapping at your door <br>Is standing in the clothes that you once wore <br>Strike another match, go start anew <br>And it's all over now, baby blue.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CJHbfkROow\">It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding</a>. Going to a Dylan concert in those days was like going to church. Absolute silence except for the man on stage standing alone singing his own songs and accompanying himself on guitar and <a href=\"https://www.dummies.com/art-center/music/harmonica/why-is-a-harmonica-called-a-harp-when-it-doesnt-have-strings/\">harp</a>. We hung on every word.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1ACh8lzHg\">It Take a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry</a>. From Dylan's 6th album, <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iIS6ZZ9RVA\">I Want You</a>. Blonde on Blonde, Dylan's 7th.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT7Hj-ea0VE\">All Along the Watchtower</a>, John Wesley Harding.</span></p>"

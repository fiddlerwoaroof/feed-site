  "content":"<p><span>Tulsi Gabbard is quite the political phenomenon: personable, very intelligent, courageous, and sensible in her views. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvkrlvYFlEU\">Here</a> she explains how her views on 2A have changed and indeed improved.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Around 9:25 Gabbard quotes from the recently-imploded ACLU: &quot;Racism is foundational to the Second Amendment.&quot;  That's just insane for so many reasons. I'll leave it to you to work out why. Or else just listen to Tulsi's commentary.</span></p>"

  "content":"<p><span>Hector C. asked me to name my top ten favorite Dylan songs. With pleasure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iHhWh9FtsQ\">Don't Think Twice</a>.  I first heard this in the Peter, Paul, and Mary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu-DWUngjhk\">version</a> circa 1962 or '63. Deeply moved by it, I bought the 45 rpm single and noted that the song was written by one B. Dylan. I pronounced the name to myself as 'Dial in' and had a sense that this songwriter was about to speak to me and my life.  And here he is still speaking to my 'lived experience' 60 years later.</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRgk6v2o9RY\"><span>She Belongs to Me</span></a></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfQbSPuxRs4\">Chimes of Freedom</a>.  With Joan Osborne, NOT Joan Baez!  Byrds' <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2nKFmXlY38\">version</a>.  No Dylan, no folk rock.</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGEIMCWob3U\"><span>My Back Pages</span></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4HW33SgZlM\"><span>It's All Over Now, Baby Blue</span></a></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHyMdIXKGgQ\">Farewell Angelina</a>. Joanie's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcwP2ulxDdY\">version</a>. No Baez, no Dylan. She took the scruffy kid under her wing and introduced him to her well-established audience.  </span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwuCF5lYqEE\"><span>Visions of Johanna</span></a></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljbxm_sKC90\">Just Like a Woman</a>.  Better than the <em>Blonde on Blonde</em> version.  </span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oecX_1pqxk0\"><span>Tambourine Man</span></a></p>\r\n<p><span>Few songs capture the 'magic' of the '60s like this one. But you had to have been there, of a certain impressionable age, with the right disposition, with an open mind, and an open heart, idealistic, a seeker, and at least a little alienated from the larger society and the quiet desperation and dead usages of parents and relatives . . . .</span></p>\r\n<p><span>YouTuber comment:  &quot;This Bob Dylan song brings me to tears and I don't know why. I'm 76 years old and remember when it was new. It still is.&quot; Comment on the comment:  &quot;This is a nostalgic feeling for the passing of the time. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade\">saudade</a> of a time whose dreams seem  real. I know about it. I'm 71.&quot;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZgBhyU4IvQ\">Not Dark Yet</a>. YouTuber comment: &quot;All my life, Dylan has been able to touch my soul. This is undoubtedly one of his best.&quot;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>An alternative Dylan top ten next week.</span></p>"

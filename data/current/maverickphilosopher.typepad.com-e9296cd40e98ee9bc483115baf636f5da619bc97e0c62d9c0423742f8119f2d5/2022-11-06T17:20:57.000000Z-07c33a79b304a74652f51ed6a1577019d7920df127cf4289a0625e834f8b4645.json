The day before yesterday I received Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, <em>Christian Perfection and Contemplation: According to St. Thomas Aquinas and St. John of the Cross.</em> Garrigou-Lagrange's </span><span>work is the real deal from perhaps the hardest of the hard-core paleo-Thomists.</span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span><span><span>While reading the chapter on infused contemplation, I thought of Thomas Merton. </span></span></span><span>Merton's sense of the reality of the Unseen Order was weak and underdeveloped because of the strong lure of the secular -- to which, however, he never entirely succumbed, </span><em>pace</em><span> the thesis of David D. Cooper's excellent but mistaken </span><em>Thomas Merton's Art of Denial: The Evolution of a Radical Humanist</em><span> (University of Georgia Press, 1989, 2008).  Cooper attributed the evolution (devolution?) to Merton's failure to achieve infused contemplation. As I read him, however, </span><span>Merton never lost his faith. He did, however, remain to the end deeply conflicted. All the Merton commentators that I have read agree that he came to question the <em>contemptus mundi</em> he expressed in <em>The Seven Storey Mountain</em>.  As for whether or not Merton attained infused contemplation, if he had why are there no references to it in his journal? There is a paucity of spiritual disclosure in those private pages of a monk who one would think would reveal the most intimate secrets of his inner life. I have read all seven volumes of his journal several times over. He is one of those key figures without whom you cannot understand the 'Sixties.</span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span>Thanks for the link.  I read the Ellsberg-Sr. Wendy correspondence with interest.</span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span>Regards,</span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span>Bill</span></div>"

(It’s behind a paywall, sorry.)  It is a reply to all of the criticisms Graham Oppy has leveled over the years against arguments of that sort, not only in his <i>Religious Studies</i>article on my Aristotelian proof, but also in his books <i>Arguing about Gods</i> and <i>Naturalism and Religion</i> and elsewhere.  (Regular readers will recall the two YouTube exchanges I had with Oppy on the program <i>Capturing Christianity</i>, which you can view <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoVDutpB4Cw\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-80lQOlNOs\">here</a>.)<p></p>"

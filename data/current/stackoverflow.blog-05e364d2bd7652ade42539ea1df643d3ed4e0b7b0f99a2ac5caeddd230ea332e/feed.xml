										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every year, we ask developers what the state of software engineering looks like for them, and tens of thousands of you answer. Generously, you tell us all about who you are, how you work, and perhaps most importantly, what languages and tools you use. As in every year, the results are sure to spark a few heated discussions—is Rust really all that great?—as people start reading the results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you know what developers like more than arguing about which programming language is best? Data. Lots and lots of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we’ve shared <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/08/02/2021-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results/">our take on the results</a>, we’re offering you the chance to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey">check out the full data set</a> and come up with your own conclusions. Want to know what countries prefer specific programming languages? Check the data. Think we’re missing the real story? Start analyzing the data set and let us know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results set contains over 80,000 responses from almost every country on Earth. Because of data export restrictions, we were unable to survey developers in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine (including Sevastopol).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In previous years, people have used the data as part of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/razamh/stack-overflow-developer-survey-analysis">data analysis tutorials</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020-programming-language-framework-salary-data/">additional salary insights</a>, and <a href="https://blog.glitch.com/post/discover-insights-explore-developer-survey-results-2019">even more accessible versions of the data</a>.&nbsp; If you’re using the database in any academic research, we love to hear about that as well. Drop us a line and we’ll see about featuring your work on this blog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note you are free to share, adapt, and create derivative works from the public 2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey results as long as you attribute them to Stack Overflow, keep the database open (if you redistribute it), and continue to share-alike any adapted database under the <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">ODbL</a>.</p>



<p>Huge thanks to all of the developers who took the survey and the larger programmer community at large. We wouldn’t be here without you, and we hope to continue to be your number one source for answers to programming questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the third lesson of the series, we’ll continue to incorporate the MVVM architecture and build a view model for our quiz app which mediates communication between the view and the model. Additionally, we’ll build a game model structure and add more questions and functionality for new questions to appear as the user advances through the quiz. </p>

<p>Here are some Stack Overflow questions related to the work we did in today’s session:</p>



<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24003918/does-swift-have-access-modifiers">Does Swift have access modifiers?&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57826430/swiftui-and-mvvm-communication-between-model-and-view-model">SwiftUI and MVVM &#8211; Communication between model and view model</a></p>



<p>If you want to ask any questions or provide feedback on the lesson, you are welcome to leave a comment on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0MEIuOxssE&amp;t=84s">YouTube recording</a> of this lesson. If you’d like to watch a session live, follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/codecademy/featured">Codecademy YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, if you want even more SwiftUI content, you can sign up for the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-ios-apps-with-swiftui">Build iOS Apps with SwiftUI</a> Skill Path this series was based on.&nbsp; The Skill Path goes into much more detail about the Swift language and provides a deeper foundation that you can use to build sophisticated applications.</p>

<p>Our co-host Paul Ford is stepping back from a lot of his technology related duties, including as CEO of Postlight and sadly, as co-host of this podcast. But that means our frequent collaborator Cassidy Williams will be joining us more often. Paul passes the torch on this episode.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As developers, we are always looking for better ways to ensure we ship quality code. Many of us already use processes such as pull requests (PRs), automated integration tests, and monitoring to make sure the code we deliver is well written and working as expected. The popularity of these workflows speaks for themselves, but what happens when they go wrong? (And they will go wrong.) When we are working at larger scales, how do we even know if they <em>are</em> going wrong? The answer is data visualization, when applied properly it’s a powerful tool for getting insight into our workflows.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll discuss three areas that visualization can make it easier to diagnose and solve problems in everyday software engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-flaky-tests">Flaky tests</h2>



<p>When testing new code, you look for tests that fail in order to highlight bugs to fix. But what about tests that only fail some of the time? We’ve all been frustrated with the subtle time-wasting of flaky tests, but how many times do we just write it off as something that just happens to us and accept the time lost as a cost of writing software? What if we were able to see just how flaky our tests were for everyone on the team?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yCzFZPIqP7S1TqP1xK9ziajlnULt-FgvLPgpf0OYR-LZDchkLM-XFyS7bBiSDxkY8ZqAdF5vDlDzoKkCFLTSaRkURVizIPPPkMusuKIVi-fQujE2Fdht7rZwFkGyYCUFGvn-HpXq=s0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The above visualization is taken from <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/integration-test-flakiness">this example open source dashboard</a> showing the status of the test suites run for the <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/actions">sveltejs/svelte</a> repository. This kind of birds-eye-view packs a lot of information in a small amount of space so your eyes can do what they do best, spot patterns. Each row in the visualization represents a single test, while each column represents a run (perhaps triggered by a pull request). If a row has a lot of red circles (test failures) you may start to suspect that test of being flaky. However if a column has a lot of red circles and/or gray circles (tests being cancelled) then it is more likely a problem with the code being pushed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integration tests in particular take a long time&nbsp; to run. If everyone on the team is waiting a few extra minutes every time they push code, those minutes can add up to days worth of wasted productivity pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following visualization shows how long each test took to run and exposes patterns.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UKyPlotZ-TnGnZVQI9aI3hzpO6M5KIf0QC0hGt_Ouuo3DWjh5B__MML5IRh4OtcgiblTL0Z6Zk-KVYlaOwC5g1YHP6CBY1eUmtFdn6F-yJFs4mRR8f7n0WwnHbAF3pY1MSdBlFxo=s0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Something you may notice in both of these visualizations is the lack of aggregation. These visualization techniques emphasize surfacing patterns by showing the underlying data directly. This enables further investigation directly from the visualization. For example, each integration test represented here has an interactive tooltip that gives details as well as deep links to the run on GitHub for further analysis.</p>



<p>Consider where we might be without these visualizations: essentially looking at a table of information. This is the standard interface for the same set of integration tests shown in the visualizations:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_oXXF-7AeQfB2n58xL42mVjZ5tEUf3TSCV5xrH8u9jc70KQ2SfNq5XPA5AyRQwzs-H5qHyUumNFSMnMWfLV-M2zFvqTT8k4JY3lO8OuXGCdNkpRScsz2LXFtIyXDogcjBUKiaGTs=s0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>While this is always a useful interface for getting detailed information and drilling into a specific test run, it does not give us a view of the patterns that can have systemic impact on our productivity.</p>



<h2 id="h-pull-requests">Pull requests</h2>



<p>Pull requests are the way most teams collaborate to ship quality code. They provide a process for giving feedback and ensuring quality, but the process isn’t always balanced. Some teammates may end up reviewing too many PRs, while others could be helping out but don’t get asked. Data visualization can help us surface these patterns in the process so we can help bring them back into balance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MdnbP4B5d6RRvo_68Mx4oUhLXFscrDxPC8C2GasIVLj3M3pKdThRXWOq3yG2GFOOEZg_XOnw7mP4FRGffeSwaH_6ATz_-TGk0beJFWWUFAiA0GVE95r4sARc3g8tDlJ7yZKwK_qW=s0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>We can use visualization to gain a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the open pull requests on a repository and answer a couple of key questions. The first question we may ask is: what is the reviewer workload across the team? It may make sense for senior members to be doing more reviewing, but you may also notice that some teammates are ready for more responsibility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fH40OGT6RVzNmxQRXFAUvvlKVLWbadmFvOZuirZHGnw6okrLPtQB0PtMwGJKcLcD18xZ4PsIdefg_CnDUf996O5hQTj0L1An8AcLjSRLKaELzDiaZUud7P4ox5hhXTg5tljmRSBt=s0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Data visualization enables us to answer another question: where are there stagnant pull requests that need attention? You can also look for patterns in PRs that have been unreviewed or stagnant for a long time. Individual developers may have that nagging feeling that their PR isn’t getting the attention it deserves, but it can be hard to understand where it fits in with all of the other work happening on the team. Seeing the unreviewed PRs in context can help a team decide what needs extra attention.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qpS4cTLMWP0v9lAlb2OYevIv1Z0kC1_FsfaX7OxhjPI41Q95DsU0USK5Ehqz-oFtvLy1vSoN24znH7NXaUrdO7ZhP4lMSejyj3atTTbKGN6sICn0OeaF_nPMmK8Qh2bI6kYC74-F=s0" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-monitoring">Monitoring</h2>



<p>A well known use case for data visualization in the engineering process is for monitoring the status of our systems. Whether it’s keeping an eye on system metrics like CPU usage and network latency or watching for an increase in errors or user signups, most teams have some sort of dashboards to track important metrics.</p>



<p>What you may not have seen is a very compact view of your metrics using what’s called a <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/07/02/changing-price-of-food-items-and-horizon-graphs/">horizon chart</a>. The following visualization shows HTTP status codes per minute for an app over an almost two week period, <em>minute-by-minute</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/n33yDXaehlRy7Bu4dztqV0ponMhhNbAdP7YQb_ARy0mJvc8qiDeWOM8QJ2R4vWGB9LCxJg8A4jla5_1ePwfahrLS_ki_J0sMVHiw-p0uh-5UBwG0JwZSTlknpMomC9cpviz0ZKOA=s0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The principle of doing the least amount of aggregation comes through again. With this compact form, we can get very detailed information while also seeing broader patterns come through. You can see that at some point around April 17th there was a huge increase in 403 errors (due to some buggy code that was deployed). For the same period, you can see that the 200 status is lighter, indicating fewer successful requests.</p>



<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3.js">D3-based </a>open source component called a <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/timechart">TimeChart</a>, which is intended to make it easier to see patterns in dense time series metrics. It supports interaction, so you can see the exact values for any minute in the time range.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FDt0ySmz6Ims9tMpk678hrt9wh7aiT-Di2rzf-eZYqL9SdkxLrJzlTW17HGLZMJwnFJwhhRpIsIpO_IX0nKom9a9vB7G0EThv4AL7dZbsio8EZocw5dFcMVef7s_ny1zaj7SEmx0=s0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Ultimately, we all want to be productive and ship quality, working code, but it’s not always easy to see how we are doing. Data visualization can be a powerful way to direct our energies and achieve a clearer view of how our processes are functioning. Aggregating as little data as possible can give us even sharper insight into what is happening in our systems. Have you used data visualization to manage your team’s engineering process? What data visualizations do you think would be beneficial to your workflow? Let us know in the comments what works for you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk to Julianna Lamb, co-founder and CTO of Stytch, about building a password-free world. Every password that you can remember can be compromised.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" height="200px" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless="" src="https://player.simplecast.com/49486019-e10b-4cf0-bc6e-bfd36d3b441d?dark=false"></iframe>



<p>Every password can be compromised. Stytch helps companies build authentication flows that don&#8217;t need user passwords. </p>



<p>Julianna grew up in Idaho, where she didn&#8217;t even know what computer science was. After stints as a software engineer and product manager, she found a role where could figure out what the organization should be building: CTO and founder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their first product was email magic links, which is more complicated than you think. Most importantly, how do you always avoid the spam folder? Copy changes in an email can make all the difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developer tooling is undergoing a renaissance now that smaller companies are getting into the game with API offerings. The big thing that differentiates good tools from bad is easy to understand &nbsp;documentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The right metaphor for API services isn&#8217;t SaaS, it&#8217;s eCommerce. Plug it in into your app without giving up design and user experience.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Like many families dislodged by the pandemic, my wife and I sent our children to a new school last year. They had to make new friends, and they had to do it while wearing masks that hid their faces and staying six feet apart on the playground. Social distancing, as the name implies, is not conducive to creating strong new social relationships.</p>



<p>Luckily, my children and their peers had a world where they could hug, jump, and run together. After school, they would meet up in the virtual world of Brookhaven, a digital city you can explore inside the Roblox universe. When it came to building rapport with their peers, the clothing, vehicles, and dwellings you can purchase inside of this app were more important to them than what they actually wore to school, the kind of car we drove, or the kind of home we lived in.</p>



<p>There has been a lot of chatter lately about the Metaverse, sparked by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">Mark Zuckerberg’s repeated declarations that building a virtual world is his company’s next big ambition</a>, and the announcement of Horizon Workrooms brings that ambition closer to reality. A question worth asking is, why now? The concept of the Metaverse was coined by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson decades ago, and technologists have been writing about it on and off ever since. Facebook isn’t the first major company to declare its ambition to build the metaverse; see for example this tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1157841800385695744">Epic Games in 2019</a> or <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/forwardtothemetaverseprimer">this wonderful essay</a> from Matthew Ball published at the beginning of 2020. Have we reached some meaningful inflection point in our journey towards this dream? </p>



<p>I think the answer is yes, and I think the tipping point is two fold. First, an ongoing pandemic has driven many to more fully adopt remote work. Companies like Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/can-facebook-make-virtual-reality-happen-for-real-this-time.html">are betting</a> that will lead to a boost in offices&nbsp; relying on virtual reality and digital avatars to forge connections and recapture some of the spark that comes from face to face interactions. A plethora of other digital tools and worlds will also try to improve the quality and immediacy of remote work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, but perhaps more novel, is the growing appetite for digital artifacts like <a href="https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/142866/why-do-nfts-have-value">NFTs</a> (non-fungible tokens). Most of us already live in a Metaverse to varying degrees, and it’s increasing presence in our lives will be fostered by a slow accumulation of digital worlds and goods growing deeper roots into our personal and social selves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unique digital assets with potentially enormous monetary value have broken free of the siloed worlds created by gaming companies and come into their own on the open web. The rise of the crypto economy has generated new forms of currency and collectibles, allowing creatives new ways to monetize, and encouraging humans to do what comes naturally to them, seeking out new ways to grow their social and financial capital.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-creeping-spread-of-the-metaverse">The creeping spread of the Metaverse</h2>



<p>The Metaverse slips into daily life differently depending on who you are. Let’s say you’re a hermit who lives in a cabin surrounded by woods. Life for you resembles a contest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alone_(TV_series)">Alone</a>. You spend each day attending to the basic needs of food and shelter. Your contact with the Metaverse is nil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What about a senior citizen who grew up in an age before the internet? Maybe you spend as much time away from a screen as in front of it, or more. The bridge game with your friends and the early bird special with your neighbors are as important to you as the number of likes on your occasional Facebook post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you might also be a grandmother who spends as much time posting on Facebook as potting plants. The conversation around an anonymous figure like Q, who has no material form, might be your guiding maxim these days. Without noticing, you have allowed an entirely digital entity to become the center of your life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, take a geriatric millennial like me. Growing up, I cared deeply about what video games my friends played, but we had to be in the same room to enjoy Nintendo’s multiplayer experience, and we cared about the cartridges someone physically owned, not the clothes the characters wore. I’ve paid money to own digital cards in a game like Hearthstone, but their purpose is to help me enjoy the game, not to act as a status symbol to others I meet online. I can’t deny however, that some of my identity is bound up in my status, or lack thereof, on social media. I crave attention and adulation there, even if it comes in the form of likes from total strangers.</p>



<p>You may believe NFTs are a flash in the pan, but the value of digital artifacts has been growing for decades. Teenagers understand the money they can make t<a href="https://joshkaufman.net/everything-i-know-about-business-i-learned-from-world-of-warcraft/">rading virtual sword and shields in World of Warcraft</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/animal-crossing-video-game-sales-diablo-ii-virtual-economies-131547613.html">selling bells they harvested in Animal Crossing</a>. Top players in esports like League of Legends are earning six and seven figure salaries. And people well outside the world of tech are paying for moments on NBA Top Shot, giving them ownership of a GIF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am still struggling to accept that a patch of pixels could be worth millions, but my kids won’t have these same reservations. From the time they entered primary school, digital objects and virtual interactions had as much significance as real world playdates or toys. Adults, sensing opportunity or simply curious to create and explore, are venturing into this same mindset. I have many friends and acquaintances in the world of media and technology who have stepped more deeply into the Metaverse. They have spent thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars on their digital avatars. They collect and trade NFTs, which hold value to them as an investment and a signal of one’s social status and disposition. The value of the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nft-trading-surges-8x-penguins-212053864.html">NFT market continues to swell</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NFTs gave me ________ .</p>&mdash; ⟠⟠⟠ tommyk.eth ⟠⟠⟠ (@tommyk_eth) <a href="https://twitter.com/tommyk_eth/status/1425098014167871499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>NFTs extend the logic that has been driving the value of in-game items. Create a digital artifact, but don’t limit it to the universe of a single game with a corporate overlord. Make it something that can be used across the open web and give it at least the veneer of a unique, singular object by tokenizing it. Sure, anyone can copy paste your $50,000 <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-bored-ape-avatars-are-taking-over-twitter">bored ape</a> avatar or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html">pudgy penguin</a> PNG. But only you can resell it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-life-lived-online">A life lived online</h2>



<p>There is a <a href="https://builtin.com/design-ux/virtual-world-design-ethics">grand vision</a> of a network of fully realized virtual worlds where users connect as believable avatars and carry their digital lives between VR, AR, and IRL. That’s not how most people live today, but we’re moving along a continuum where more of everyday life is mediated through digital worlds and personas with each passing year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As someone who has struggled with an addiction to video games, I’m afraid of the world my children are growing into. It seems likely that, the earlier you step into the Metaverse, the greater the chances it will hold a deep and lasting significance as you age. While virtual connections were a lifeline during a pandemic lockdown, when seeing each other in person was dangerous, I’m troubled by research that indicates teenagers whose everyday lives are dominated by their social interactions online are <a href="https://www.psycom.net/social-media-depression-teens">more likely to experience depression</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What gives me hope is that there seems to be a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/29/teens-desert-social-media">cohort of young people</a> who understand the risks and are rejecting a life lived completely online. And <a href="https://theconversation.com/flawed-data-led-to-findings-of-a-connection-between-time-spent-on-devices-and-mental-health-problems-new-research-162585">new research</a> indicates that the connection between a life lived online and mental health struggles may not be as significant as early work claimed. The pandemic has been a powerful reminder that video calls and multiplayer games can only provide so much social sustenance. Once it’s safe to gather again, I think we’ll see a swell of offline activities. Meanwhile, the building blocks for the Metaverse continue to be laid into a foundation.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk with Quincy Brown, the head of programs at AnitaB.org and former computer science professor. This organization supports women in engineering and organizes the Grace Hopper Celebration, while providing scholarships, advocacy, and policy support for women in engineering.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" height="200px" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless="" src="https://player.simplecast.com/9cac1891-9097-445d-bcb6-0a4d2253f5c7?dark=false"></iframe>



<h2 id="h-show-notes">Show notes</h2>



<p>In 1987, Anita Borg, AnitaB.org&#8217;s namesake, saw how few women were at a &#8220;systems&#8221; conference. A few casual chats turned into the listserv, Systers, which continues to offer a place for women in engineering to meet and discuss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grace Hopper—that&#8217;s Navy Rear Admiral Hopper to you, civilian—was the first to devise a theory of programming languages that were machine-independent. She created the FLOW-MATIC programming language, which served as the basis for&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COBOL</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quincy started in electrical engineering and learned FORTRAN. That experience with how computers operate on hardware helped her teach C++. The difference is like listening to vinyl vs. mp3s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Should UX designers create technology that you need to adapt to or adapts to you? And will different generations create different interaction paradigms?</p>



<p>We&#8217;re out of lifeboat badges, so we summoned a Necromancer winner! Congrats to&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/9143529/stealth">stealth</a>&nbsp;who was awarded the badge for their answer to the question,&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27195977/adding-multiple-columns-in-mysql-with-one-statement">Adding multiple columns in MySQL with one statement.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s been 13 years since Stack Overflow was founded. It began with a simple mission, to serve as a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. It’s become a place where anyone could ask for help or share some knowledge and where all the content created by the community would be open and accessible to the public. The landscape of software and technology has evolved tremendously in the decade since, and Stack Overflow has become a central hub in the day-to-day practice of software development for coders around the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this seed, an entire universe of Q&amp;A sites blossomed, becoming the Stack Exchange Network. Some of these sites focused on topics closely related to software development, but many others centered on topics—cooking, parenting, home repair—that had nothing to do with computer programming, but fostered a devoted community of experts who built up tremendous libraries of knowledge in their particular field. Now we’ve got over 175 sites building individual libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we are celebrating a group of sites that passed their 10th birthday during the first half of 2021. They have helped millions learn new languages, repair their cars, and sharpen their skills at code review. If you have a favorite question, answer, or experience from one of these sites, please share it in the comments. We’ll add our favorites to the post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Most companies aim to build high-performing teams that have motivated engineers. One of the best ways to achieve this is through creating an environment that allows your engineers to constantly grow and develop their skills. Assigning your engineers some stretch work assignments will help with creating this growth-based work environment.</p>



<p>Stretch work assignments are tasks or projects that are a bit beyond an engineer’s current skill or knowledge level and that allow them to improve and learn new things. When done correctly these assignments serve a dual purpose of providing learning opportunities for your engineers, while at the same time completing a project or task that will help your company.</p>



<p>Some examples of stretch work assignments for engineers:</p>



<ul><li>Taking the lead on a project outside of their current duties.&nbsp;</li><li>Mentoring interns.&nbsp;</li><li>Working on a project with a tight deadline that forces quick and pragmatic decisions.&nbsp;</li><li>Joining a project that uses a different programming language/technology to the one they are used to.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>When setting up stretch work assignments for your engineers, you want to identify tasks that are at the appropriate level: a little bit more than what an engineer has shown themselves capable of. You also want to ensure you don’t set up your engineers for failure by assigning them with stretch work assignments that are impossible or overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, I will discuss how to assign effective stretch work assignments for your engineers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-keep-stretch-work-assignments-small-and-manageable">Keep stretch work assignments small and manageable</h2>



<p>Breaking down stretch work assignments into smaller pieces allows engineers to receive faster feedback on their learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A small stretch work assignment allows engineers to measure their progress and receive useful feedback in short cycles: every few days or every week. Small stretch assignments have a defined achievable goal for each cycle.&nbsp; You should deconstruct extremely ambitious stretch work assignments for your engineers into several short-term stretch goals and include multiple cycles. Achieving small wins will help your engineers maintain motivation and engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While doing stretch assignments helps engineers grow faster, tackling large tasks that take a long time can easily backfire. Your engineers may lose motivation along the way or can suffer from burnout. If being stretched means your engineers are falling behind in parts of their work, then anxiety can build up. It also lowers the impact failing can have on the engineers. Failing fast on a small project is less painful than on a long-running project. That is why it is important to keep stretch work assignments small.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-make-stretch-assignments-temporary">Make stretch assignments temporary</h2>



<p>Stretch work assignments are effective when they are a safe way for your engineers to take on additional responsibilities and an opportunity for growth and feedback. Stretch work assignments that are temporary additional responsibilities for your engineers allow them to experiment, learn, and grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ensuring the additional responsibility is temporary makes it safer as there is no fear of carrying that additional responsibility permanently. It also makes it safe to fail, as not every stretch work assignment is going to be a success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With any additional workload, you increase the chances of burnout for your engineers. Temporary stretch assignments minimize that. To get ahead of any burnout, you could scale back to their usual day-to-day responsibilities during stretch work assignments. You could even assign the responsibilities that you scaled back to another engineer as an additional stretch work assignment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-set-realistic-stretch-assignments">Set realistic stretch assignments</h2>



<p>Stretch work assignments have to be realistic to get engineers to stretch without breaking. A realistic stretch work assignment is one in which you have a high degree of confidence your engineer can succeed if they put in the work. It is a task that is possible to achieve in your environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When leadership is over-excited and sets goals that are impossible to reach, significant damage can be done to the engineers’ careers. When talented engineers become overwhelmed or set up for failure, they can end up looking for a better work environment outside your company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stretch work assignments must be carefully designed. Combine engineer self-assessment and manager assessment to determine the appropriate stretch assignments.</p>



<p>From the managers’ perspective, you should first really understand the strengths and interests of an engineer and then work to identify which stretch work assignments are a good fit. You should aim to challenge the engineer with a project that would sound interesting to them and be difficult but doable. Ask the following questions about an engineer before assigning them a stretch work assignment:</p>



<ul><li>Is the engineer ready for the change?</li><li>Is the engineer ready to be uncomfortable?</li><li>Is the engineer ready to make mistakes and learn from them?</li></ul>



<p>From the engineers’ perspective, a self-assessment can determine if they are ready to take on a stretch work assignment. The engineer should be honest with themselves and assess the following:</p>



<ul><li>Whether there is a risk they will overreach, take on too much, and compromise their ability to fulfill their regular responsibilities well.&nbsp;</li><li>What trade-offs it might take in their personal life to accommodate extra hours at work.&nbsp;</li><li>Whether the stretch work assignment aligns with the growth they are interested in.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Realistic and effective stretch work assignments are just above an engineer’s current skill or knowledge level and force them to improve and learn new things.</p>



<h2 id="h-provide-management-support">Provide management support</h2>



<p>For a stretch assignment to succeed, you can’t just throw a project to an engineer and hope for the best; management must provide support to these engineers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Managers should set clear expectations about stretch work assignments. When do they start? What is their expected outcome? How much time is expected to be dedicated to them? When do they end? This will help provide clarity to engineers and permit them to work within a defined scope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Managers should also give engineers the resources and authority they require to succeed. If an engineer requires resources such as a monetary budget or elevated access to IT systems to complete their stretch work assignment, their manager should make those resources available to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineers have a better chance at succeeding when there is support from senior leaders across the company.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-match-stretch-work-assignments-with-engineer-passion">Match stretch work assignments with engineer passion</h2>



<p>Stretch work assignments are challenging, additional responsibilities on top of an engineer&#8217;s existing role. Strong motivation is required for engineers to be willing to take on these additional responsibilities and succeed at them. How do you motivate your engineers to take on additional responsibilities? Align the additional responsibilities with the engineers&#8217; passions.</p>



<p>Engineers are more likely to succeed if stretch work assignments align with their passions. Every engineer has something career-related they are passionate about, an area they would like to grow further in and will enjoy working on. Assigning engineers with projects they are passionate about will reduce the risk of them failing. The old adage applies—“choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.”</p>



<p>The ideal stretch work assignments fuel your engineers’ passions, play to their strengths, and allow them to make a measurable business impact. Below are some questions you can ask to determine if an assignment aligns with an engineer’s passion.</p>



<ul><li>Does it align with the engineer’s personal mission?&nbsp;</li><li>Does it align with the engineer’s career aspirations?&nbsp;</li><li>Does it truly spark the engineer’s passion?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>To answer the above questions, you need to have a career conversation with the engineer to help with understanding their short-term and long-term goals. This is a meaningful discussion between an engineer and another party—most often a manager—about aspects of their career that the engineer feels are of significant positive value. It should connect an engineer&#8217;s past – gaining a detailed understanding of who they are and what motivates them at work through their life story – with their future – the wildest dreams they have for themselves at the pinnacle of their career. Only with a detailed understanding of both the path behind them and the dream in the distance is it possible to plan a path forward right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-keep-stretch-work-assignments-voluntary">Keep stretch work assignments voluntary</h2>



<p>Stretch work assignments exist as extra work on top of an engineer’s regular day-to-day responsibilities. Some engineers may want to focus on getting better and doing well at their day-to-day responsibilities as opposed to taking on stretch work assignments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forcing engineers to take on stretch work assignments by making them compulsory will likely result in demotivated engineers. Engineers may not be interested in the area you are pushing them to grow. They may not have capacity due to other commitments. If they take on the stretch work assignments despite these concerns, they will likely fail at them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep your stretch work assignments voluntary for your engineers; stretch work should never be given to an engineer without them first asking for it. The voluntary nature of it means that engineers can step into the role for a project they feel comfortable with. Engineers will likely volunteer for stretch work assignments they have some interest in and believe they can accomplish. This helps with assigning stretch work that is at the appropriate level and not overwhelming for the engineers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Stretch work assignments are designed to help your engineers improve and learn new things. When done correctly, these assignments serve a dual purpose of providing learning opportunities for your engineers and completing a project or task that will help your company.</p>



<p>But the key is to hand out stretch work assignments that are at the appropriate level for your engineers to ensure they do not get overwhelmed and break. Failure is part of these assignments, but frustration and burnout shouldn’t be. Apply the suggested approaches to constantly grow and develop your engineers. Over time, your company will have highly skilled, well-rounded engineers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SwiftUI is Apple&#8217;s newest framework for building iOS applications.&nbsp; It uses the best features of the Swift language to enable writing performative, declarative code.&nbsp; If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to build your own iOS applications, now is an excellent time to get started.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/codecademy-live-build-ios-apps-with-swiftui/">Codecademy Live: Build a Quiz App with SwiftUI series</a> will be hosted by Codecademy Curriculum Developers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-stone-7859b637/">Ben Stone</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/galina-podstrechnaya/">Galina Podstrechnaya</a> who created the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-ios-apps-with-swiftui">Build iOS Apps with SwiftUI course</a> on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The live series will start with an introduction to Xcode and building simple views.&nbsp; Over the course of the series, we&#8217;ll create a fully functional quiz application.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be building off of the skill path, but making adjustments to cover some additional content.</p>



<p>In the first lesson of the series, we&#8217;ll walk through what tools are needed to start developing apps for iOS.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll learn how to use Xcode, how to add views to your app, and how to customize them using view modifiers.</p>

<p>Here are some Stack Overflow questions related to the work we did in today’s session:</p>



<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56452250/whats-with-constraints-in-swiftui/56471369#56471369">What&#8217;s with Constraints in SwiftUI?</a></p>



<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56437036/swiftui-how-do-i-change-the-background-color-of-a-view">SwiftUI &#8211; How do I change the background color of a View?</a></p>



<p>If you want to ask any questions or provide feedback on the lesson, you are welcome to leave a comment on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFT21IzGW1w">YouTube recording</a> of this lesson. If you’d like to watch a session live, follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/codecademy/featured">Codecademy YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, if you want even more SwiftUI content, you can sign up for the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-ios-apps-with-swiftui">Build iOS Apps with SwiftUI</a> Skill Path this series was based on.&nbsp; The Skill Path goes into much more detail about the Swift language and provides a deeper foundation that you can use to build sophisticated applications.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Not every domain is serious business. Here's a few of the fun ones that we at Stack Overflow owned, as well as those owned by our community. </p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/08/11/the-strange-domain-names-that-developers-bought/">The strange domain names that developers bought</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stackoverflow.blog">Stack Overflow Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>These days, a domain name is about as easy to acquire as it is to conceive of. If no one else already has your idea, you can get whatever nonsense you can think of for less than US$20 per year. When it comes to developers, it turns out that twenty bucks is not that much to pay for a joke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years we noticed that asking about domain names was always a great conversation starter at Stack Overflow. So we asked around on Twitter and Facebook, as well as our engineering team, to see what everyone’s strangest domain purchases were.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the record, I’ve had my share of goofy domains. Before joining Stack Overflow, I had robertstackoverflow.com, a stray thought that I decided to take too far and then gave up on when I couldn’t suss out the video editing software. Speaking of dumb jokes, I also have allis.horse, after a conversation about horse cults. For my dad’s birthday one year, he asked me to get him faciebookie.com because he hates Facebook and wanted to put up counter-programming there. Place your bets on its future, but nothing has happened with it so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the responses that we got, there was a common theme: a playful idea that someone purchased on a whim but never took any further. Heck, here at Stack Overflow, the company has bought its share of weird domains. A selection of them are presented here without comment:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2012/10/29/se-podcast-35-a-biscuit-away-from-jerry-stiller/">abiscuitawayfromjerrystiller.com</a></li><li>diablo3acts.com</li><li>hatfight.com</li><li>isstackoverflowdownforeveryoneorjustme.com</li><li>liehound.com</li><li>ninjawanted.com</li><li>stackofdice.com</li><li>stackosphere.com</li><li>vast-and-endless-sea.com</li></ul>



<p>Our adoring fans had plenty of ridiculous domains to share as well. Note that there are strange domain names here and some that have lapsed ownership, so no direct links will be given. Visit them at your own risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-joke-made-real">A joke made real</h2>



<p>A large number of the oddball domains that we heard about were little jokes people took from their heads to a domain registrar, like my own robertstackoverflow.com. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/go4prateek?comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoxMDE1MTQzODA4NDUwOTk3MV8xMDE1MTQzODA5MjkzOTk3MQ%3D%3D&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWsgpbUu5nRW4NQ5Vmf8eiVtWel37xDpaspUnsD3PJewE4X9UbbQy9820AAsUM4rf0XZxYms8m_XlgZqXLEHhtkUlYRRKwLFDr-KOIBmK2shjyVPyWYYfiDMYlcMIb7sdPoSrYE6rmJeDP3mlFNOpvDDyPBeZRzWwVaFffP9qs-Lg&amp;__tn__=R]-R">Prateek Singh</a> on Facebook was on my level here, admitting to purchasing heapunderflow.com.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The king of the joke domains was <a href="https://twitter.com/jessejjohnson">@jessejjohnson</a> on Twitter. He shared takemetoprom.com, opensourceidiots.com, buffmasterflex.com, and, threateningly, “so many more.” One wonders how many of these actually had a website behind them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our own Director of Brand Design, David Longworth shared his internal joke. “I bought planofasnack.com based on an impulse while looking for dinner one night after a few drinks ‘Whats our food plan of attack? Wait, our plan of a snack?!’&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Senior Software Engineer Michael Stum had the nerdiest joke: “I used to own 14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459.net, with one subdomain, 3. Made for a fun email address for a bit.”</p>



<p>Sometimes you can’t get the joke you want. Site reliability engineer Jade Sprague told us about her consolation prize of a domain: “I have xebec.ws, but there&#8217;s not really a story behind that one, other than at the time, krabouillator.ws was taken and that&#8217;s the one I really wanted. In Warhammer 40K, the Orks faction have a big robot called a Stompa, but in French it gets translated as ‘Krabouillator’ for some reason. The Stompa looks nothing like a crab, so nobody remembers why it got translated to ‘Krabouillator.’ The Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian translations are nothing like that. As for Xebec, it&#8217;s a type of sailing ship, but mostly it&#8217;s an odd-looking word that&#8217;s memorable.”</p>



<p>Most of these domains shouldn’t be followed. That goes double for <a href="https://twitter.com/NNekoru">@NNekoru</a>’s friend, who owned suspicious.link.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever had a typo for breakfast? <a href="https://twitter.com/medium_bot">@medium_bot</a> had Buscuit.org.</p>



<p>This next one is really childish, but not inaccurate. <a href="https://twitter.com/Henok45724681">@Henok45724681</a> shared assfart.gas.

<p>Beyond just jokes, some of our responders had some very niche business and website ideas. We’re just waiting for science and/or public policy to catch up. .&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://app.slack.com/team/U0244S42TDK">Vlad Jimenez</a> had himself a gold mine if he could pair his domain tacobeam.me with a teleporter of some sort.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/readcodesing">@readcodesing</a> got idiotdarts.com to implement someone else’s joke. “I wanted to implement Gallagher&#8217;s idea where you got several darts a month and could shoot them at other cars.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/diginaresh">@diginaresh</a> must have figured that the market was saturated for smart hackers. So he got dumbhacker.com.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/raddevus">@raddevus</a> bought quotimal.com to increase the number of cute and inspirational cats on the internet. “It’s quotes with animal pictures of course.”</p>



<p>I assume <a href="https://twitter.com/HKLilhore">@HKLilhore</a> was tired of how long the world was taking, so he made his own at Fiveminuteworld.com.</p>

<h2 id="h-a-professional-website-but-sillier">A professional website but sillier</h2>



<p>Several people shared the weird places where you can find their professional presences. For some, you can thank the wonders of new&nbsp; TLDs in the tradition of walmart.horse. Others were poorly thought out domain names that professional companies wanted to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surprisingly (or not surprisingly, depending on how mad you are at us right now), several Stack Overflow developers have ridiculous TLDs with their name attached. Developer Benjamin Hodgson has benjamin.pizza as his personal site. Software Engineer Gabe Breda Koscky has gabe.fail but has failed to do anything with it. And Staff Engineer Adam Lear regrets his choice of website domain name:</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not super weird, more of a ‘that seemed like a good idea at the time.’ I own lear.rocks, which allows me to have an email address that&#8217;s honestly too awkward to give out and is also quite likely not to be accepted by various websites. For example, Ubisoft can&#8217;t send a recovery email to it, and Goodreads would only allow me to log in on the web, but not on the mobile app.”</p>



<p>Other folks thought a long and clever domain name was the way to go. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pawel.mach0?comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoxMDE1MTQzODA4NDUwOTk3MV8xMDE1MTQzODMxMTcxOTk3MQ%3D%3D&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWsgpbUu5nRW4NQ5Vmf8eiVtWel37xDpaspUnsD3PJewE4X9UbbQy9820AAsUM4rf0XZxYms8m_XlgZqXLEHhtkUlYRRKwLFDr-KOIBmK2shjyVPyWYYfiDMYlcMIb7sdPoSrYE6rmJeDP3mlFNOpvDDyPBeZRzWwVaFffP9qs-Lg&amp;__tn__=R]-R">Paweł Mach</a> said, “I own notimplementedexception.pl. This is what I called my business. I thought it was funny until I had to spell it out for the fourth time.” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mdxd3d4d674541540054544r45gfgfghh6ffh5klg35ogr?comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoxMDE1MTQzODA4NDUwOTk3MV8xMDE1MTQzODI2MTc4OTk3MQ%3D%3D&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWsgpbUu5nRW4NQ5Vmf8eiVtWel37xDpaspUnsD3PJewE4X9UbbQy9820AAsUM4rf0XZxYms8m_XlgZqXLEHhtkUlYRRKwLFDr-KOIBmK2shjyVPyWYYfiDMYlcMIb7sdPoSrYE6rmJeDP3mlFNOpvDDyPBeZRzWwVaFffP9qs-Lg&amp;__tn__=R]-R">Michael Blanco</a> ran into the same problem with blueorangetekknologee.com. “I used to own it for my portfolio because I wanted to buy a cheap domain name, even if it&#8217;s difficult to memorize.”</p>



<p>Even companies aren’t immune from having silly domain names. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/neil.prestemon?comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoxMDE1MTQzODA4NDUwOTk3MV8xMDE1MTQzODA5MjcyNDk3MQ%3D%3D&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWsgpbUu5nRW4NQ5Vmf8eiVtWel37xDpaspUnsD3PJewE4X9UbbQy9820AAsUM4rf0XZxYms8m_XlgZqXLEHhtkUlYRRKwLFDr-KOIBmK2shjyVPyWYYfiDMYlcMIb7sdPoSrYE6rmJeDP3mlFNOpvDDyPBeZRzWwVaFffP9qs-Lg&amp;__tn__=R]-R">Neil Prestemon</a> bought klak.click for his employer at the time. “At that time, &#8216;.click&#8217; was one of the cheapest TLDs you could register.”</p>



<h2 id="h-camping-trips">Camping trips</h2>



<p>Last but not least are the domain names that people bought as strange speculations, miners on a digital gold rush. Not all of them paid off, but some of them did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Software Engineer Ben Kelly told us about his brush with fortune. “Not me personally, but I know a guy that owned stovetop.com (in 2016!). He foolishly let it lapse (I wanted it) and Kraft foods bought it. It is now on every box of stuffing you see in the grocery store.”</p>



<p>Our own ancient mariner and Architecture Lead Nick Craver told us about Stack Overflow’s own camped domain. “We had <a href="http://thenewnewnewipad.com/">thenewnewnewipad.com</a> as a business strategy for a while but Apple never bit.”</p>



<p>Software engineer Kristina Lustig jumped at the chance of having a politically relevant typo domain: “Once during a presidential debate, Biden garbled his attempt at telling people how to learn more about him, and I looked up right away and bought that domain name. I never did anything with it and can&#8217;t remember what it was anyway.”</p>

<p>We chat with Andrew Mason, a serial entrepreneur who has worked on Groupon, Detour, and now Descript. His latest company harnesses machine learning for automatic transcription, but also for more unique features. Messed up a line or mispronounced a name? Descript can generate new words from scratch that match a speaker&#8217;s voice.</p>



<h2 id="h-episode-notes">Episode Notes</h2>



<p>Mason began his career as a developer, went on to be a CEO, but also found time to produce&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/andrew-mason-raises-your-hands-up-in-the-air/#:~:text=If%20you're%20a%20tech,how%20to%20run%20your%20startup.">80s alt rock album</a>&nbsp;full of advice on how to run your startup.</p>



<p>Slack began life as a video game company, eventually pivoting to make an internal chat tool it had built into its main business. Descript had a similar journey, taking &nbsp;the editing software Mason and his team developed at Detour, and moving it to become the center of a new business after&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/detour-dot-com/detour-the-next-chapter-6f1aa2d97a14">Detour was acquired by Bose</a>.</p>



<p>Headquartered in Montreal,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.descript.com/lyrebird">Lyrebird</a>&nbsp;is the AI division of Descript . It was founded by PhD students studying under Yoshua Bengio, who won the Turing Prize in 2019 for his pioneering research into deep learning and neural networks.</p>



<p>Our lifeboat badge of the week goes to Avinash, who explained what to do with a&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51259814/invalid-syntax-error-on-running-aws-command/51298492#51298492">invalid syntax error that arises while running an AWS command</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I didn’t take a single English class to receive my undergraduate engineering degree. It’s a shame because writing has been arguably one of the most important skills I’ve had in my career as a software engineer and team leader.</p>



<p>I got my second internship in college thanks to a strong cover letter. As a new graduate, I got my first job by sending a cold email to an interesting startup I found online. When I was put in charge of an engineering team a few years later, two of my first few hires knew me through my blog before applying. And, in 2020, I left my role as a CTO to <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">start a technical writing business</a> because so many companies were asking me to write developer-focused content.</p>



<p>While my experience might be unique (very few engineers go on to become professional writers), writing is an important skill for all of us in software development. According to <a href="https://procomm.ieee.org/the-writing-engineer/">an IEEE article</a>, engineers spend a large part of their day writing, and it only increases as they get more senior:</p>



<p>“In their ﬁrst few years on the job, engineers spend roughly 30% of their workday writing, while engineers in middle management write for 50% to 70% of their day; those in senior management reportedly spend over 70% and as much as 95% of their day writing.” &#8211; Jon Leydens as cited in <a href="https://procomm.ieee.org/the-writing-engineer/"><em>The Writing Engineer</em></a></p>



<p>The move towards remote work over the past year has also reminded many managers of how important it is for their teams to be able to write. 30% of respondents to <a href="https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/the-future-of-remote-work">Upwork’s Future of Work Survey</a> cited communication issues as one of the biggest challenges in going remote.</p>



<h2 id="h-software-engineering-is-a-team-sport">Software engineering is a team sport</h2>



<p>If you’re new to engineering, you might have the misconception that software development is largely done in quiet rooms full of developers independently writing code.</p>



<p>While writing code is part of the job, the other, often larger component is deciding what code to write and how to write it. This portion is largely collaborative as business, technical, and interpersonal interests must work in tandem to produce any significant piece of software.</p>



<p>“Every industry has truths that are obvious to those who have spent time working in the industry, but may be surprising to those on the outside. One such truth for software engineers: our jobs involve an awful lot of writing.” &#8211; <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">Ben McCormick, Engineering Manager at Kustomer</a></p>



<p>Most production-ready software projects are built by large groups of people, and those people have to communicate. Whether you are creating technical documentation, giving another team member feedback on their pull request, planning a new project, or answering a question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, it’s likely that you’ll spend at least a little time writing something every day as a software developer.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-writing-can-advance-your-career-as-a-developer">How writing can advance your career as a developer</h2>



<p>Writing ability might be a baseline requirement for many software development jobs, but it’s not a skill that developers typically think about improving for their careers. While it’s tempting to invest all your spare time learning new frameworks and languages, improving your writing might actually be a better way to advance your career and stand out in tech.</p>



<p>For this piece, I spoke to eight software developers to learn more about how writing has helped them advance their careers. I then distilled their stories into five specific benefits that writing has given them throughout their careers and added a bit of my own experience as well.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-writing-reinforces-learning">1. Writing reinforces learning</h3>



<p>As software engineers, we have to constantly be learning new things. According to the most recent <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020">Stack Overflow developer survey</a>, “75% of respondents noted that they learn a new technology at least every few months or once a year.”</p>



<p>Educators have understood the value of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/developing-assignments/cross-discipline-skills/using-writing-learning-tool">writing as a learning tool</a> for years, and everyone I talked to mentioned that writing helped them reinforce new concepts too. If you write publicly, you get the dual advantage of possibly teaching other engineers some of the concepts you’ve learned.</p>



<p>“Writing code to solve a problem is one thing, but explaining that solution to a community of developers on the internet is another. You want to make sure you absolutely know what you&#8217;re saying; which means research, lots of research!” &#8211; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/malgamves/">Daniel Phiri</a>, Developer Relations at <a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezesundayeze/">Eze Sunday</a>, a software developer and freelance writer, agreed, adding, “if you can&#8217;t teach it, then you don&#8217;t really know it.”</p>



<p>I’ve never been a note-taker, but I’ve always tried to write blog posts about new things that I’m learning. Very few of these posts got a lot of readers, but they were a great way for me to reinforce new technology or tools that I had recently learned. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duvander/">Adam DuVander</a>, a developer, consultant, and author of <a href="https://everydeveloper.com/developer-marketing/book/"><em>Developer Marketing Does Not Exist</em></a>, gave me similar advice:<br></p>



<p>“Look back at your most recent commits. Pick a fun technical challenge you faced and share how you fixed it. If you do this every month or two, you’ll have more technical posts than almost any other working engineer.” &#8211; Adam DuVander</p>



<h3 id="h-2-writing-can-help-you-find-jobs-and-clients">2. Writing can help you find jobs and clients</h3>



<p>Writing can help reinforce topics that you know, but it’s also <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1416840540151234560">a window into your skills as a software engineer</a>.</p>



<p>“[Writing] is social proof of my ability to learn in public,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mooreds/">Dan Moore</a>, Head of Developer Relations at <a href="http://fusionauth.io/">FusionAuth</a> told me. “My writing was instrumental in getting my first job in developer relations, as I met the company at a conference and was able to show them work examples.”</p>



<p>“I owe my entire career to a couple of articles I wrote,” Adam DuVander told me. “A tutorial I wrote on <a href="https://www.webmonkey.com/">Webmonkey</a> led to my first developer job. They saw how I discussed the technology and knew before we even chatted that I could handle the work.” He went on to add that writing helped him get a job with <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> among other career opportunities. “My whole career really all comes back to writing,” he said.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/radiomorillo">Stephanie Morillo</a>, a technical program manager and author of <a href="https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/product-page/the-developer-s-guide-to-content-creation"><em>The Developer’s Guide to Content Creation</em></a>, had several examples of how writing has helped her on her career journey:</p>



<p>“I once got a full-time offer to join a cloud computing startup as a copywriter on the strength of a few blog posts I&#8217;d written. I wrote a few articles about tech culture in the mid-2010s and was able to secure conference speaking engagements from them. I was offered a role as a part-time technical writer for an open-source organization, and I even started doing freelance copywriting on the side for [software development] agencies.” &#8211; Stephanie Morillo</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgramila/">John Gramila</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keanankoppenhaver/">Keanan Koppenhaver</a>, both software consultants in Chicago, had similar stories of getting new clients thanks to articles they’ve published about various software engineering topics. “People want to engage and want to reach out,” Keanan said, “but if you never put yourself out there with something you&#8217;ve written, you won&#8217;t see many of those opportunities.”</p>



<h3 id="h-3-writing-can-lead-to-book-authorship-and-public-speaking-opportunities">3. Writing can lead to book authorship and public speaking opportunities</h3>



<p>Back in 2017, I challenged myself to write something every day. Most of the pieces that came out of that experiment were random programming topics I was learning, but for about three months, I focused on a series of articles about using PHP with Docker.</p>



<p>This led to a <a href="https://leanpub.com/first-php-docker-application">short, self-published book</a>, conference speaking opportunities, and lots of consulting offers over the years. I didn’t feel like I was an expert on PHP or Docker, but because very few people were writing about the topics publicly, my work stood out.</p>



<p>Dan Moore had a similar experience, turning a collection of his blog posts into a full-length book (<a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/the-book/"><em>Letters to a New Developer</em></a>). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesmhickey/">James Hickey</a>, a Senior Software Engineer and Microsoft MVP, echoed similar opportunities thanks to his writing. “I have had many people reach out to me about doing contract work simply by reading my blog and had many offers to write books in the last couple of years.”</p>



<p>Adam DuVander pointed out that taking on projects like writing a book or speaking at a conference is a career differentiator as well. “Instead of competing with all other engineers, you become <em>The Choice</em> in your area,” he told me. “Write about it and if there’s enough business interest, you’ll find a great role.”</p>



<h3 id="h-4-preserves-your-personal-historical-record">4. Preserves your personal historical record</h3>



<p>If you work for a company with restrictive intellectual property rules, you might not be able to share much about your day job publicly, but even writing privately can be valuable.</p>



<p>Stephanie Morillo told me that she recommends developers try journaling. “Journaling gives you the opportunity to write without being self-conscious because you&#8217;re not writing with an audience in mind; you&#8217;re doing it for yourself.”</p>



<p>Dan Moore added that “Writing serves as a historical record, but more importantly it clarifies your thoughts. I often write down a question or issue I&#8217;m facing and find that I see new avenues for exploration.”</p>



<p>Recording your logic at a point in time is also important because it’s likely to change (and hopefully improve) over time. I’ve found myself coming back to the same ideas and engineering problems repeatedly over the years.</p>



<p>This revisitation of the same topics is now <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/technical-content#6-invest-in-interesting-ideas">part of my writing process</a>, as each time I write about something, my ideas and arguments get a little stronger. In the same way that <a href="https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs5500f14/Notes/Prototyping1/planToThrowOneAway.html">Fred Brooks warns us</a> that “In most projects, the first system built is barely usable,” I find the first piece I write about a topic is much less compelling than later iterations.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-writing-opens-up-new-career-opportunities">5. Writing opens up new career opportunities</h3>



<p>Finally, having both writing and programming skills opens you up to entirely new career options. Whether you’re experiencing burnout or simply want to look for new challenges, developers who can write have a lot of options for <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/alternative-career-paths/">alternative career paths</a>.</p>



<p>“The options are almost infinite, but include product, technical account management, marketing, sales engineering, and more. You can combine your authentic technical background with the ability to communicate it in a role where those skills are both much needed and rare.” &#8211; Adam DuVander</p>



<p>While writing may not be quite as lucrative as software development, there are plenty of hybrid roles like technical writing, developer relations, and technical training that offer very good salaries and career advancement opportunities.</p>



<p>I don’t expect many developers to take these alternative pathways, but it’s helpful to know these roles exist. Many people who get burned out of software development have a hard time deciding what they can do with their skills, but if you enjoy writing, there are plenty of unconventional options.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-started">Getting started</h2>



<p>Writing is an essential part of modern software development, and it’s only getting more critical as remote work becomes increasingly common. That said, you don’t have to start a public blog just to get started. Taking on small projects like answering Stack Overflow questions, writing Twitter threads, keeping a journal, or taking extra time on your company’s internal documentation are all good ways to get started.</p>



<p>If you want to start your own blog, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, <a href="https://dev.to/">Dev.to</a>, and <a href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> are all popular options for developers. Or, if you’d prefer to get paid to write, there are many great <a href="https://github.com/malgamves/CommunityWriterPrograms">technical blogs that pay contributors</a>.</p>



<p>However you do it, I’d encourage you to just get started. When you do, <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">let me know about your journey on Twitter</a>. I’d love to follow along!</p>

<p>We chat with Mark Porter, CTO of MongoDB, about his history using and building some of the foundational databases of the last four decades. We walk through his time at Oracle and AWS, then delve into the trends he&#8217;s focused on at MongoDB, such as time series capabilities and serverless instances.</p>



<h2 id="h-episode-notes">Episode Notes</h2>



<p>Mark started out on a 4k TRS-80 Model I. He had to program it in assembly language, as there wasn&#8217;t enough memory to use the local Basic copy.</p>



<p>Throughout his career, he&#8217;s oscillated between using databases and building databases. He started at Caltech and NASA, using databases to store and organize space data and chip data. Then he built databases at Oracle, including versions, 5 6, 7, and 8.</p>



<p>After that it was back to using databases at NewsCorp for huge student data systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He built databases at AWS with Amazon RDS, then moved to Grab Taxi, the Uber of Southeast Asia, and finally back to MongoDB, where he is building again.</p>



<p>You can find Mark on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/marklovestech">here</a>.</p>



<p>This week&#8217;s lifeboat badge goes to Erik Kalkoken, who answered the question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42662450/in-a-slack-is-there-a-way-to-see-all-the-members-that-is-part-of-that-channel/42663087#42663087">In a Slack, is there a way to see all the members that is part of that channel?</a></p>

<p>We chat with David Gibson, the data analyst who led this year&#8217;s Developer Survey, to understand the techniques that went into crafting our results. He also breaks down some of the most interesting trends and insights derived from new questions and comparisons we haven&#8217;t done before.</p>



<h2 id="h-episode-notes">Episode Notes</h2>



<p>This year over 80,000 respondents took the time to share their feedback on the tools and trends that are shaping software development.</p>



<p>We learned a lot about the way developers learn. ﻿For the rising cohort of coders under the age of 18, online resources like videos and blogs are more popular than books and school combined, a statistic that doesn’t hold for any of our other age cohorts. ﻿﻿</p>



<p>Roughly a third of respondents responded to our question on mental health. This is twice the percentage that offered feedback in 2020 and may reflect a growing awareness of the importance of mental health’s and the impact of the ongoing pandemic.</p>



<p>Another trend that may be linked to the pandemic is work status. We see a greater percentage of respondents working part-time or in school, while those indicating full time employment decreased. This may reflect the effects of the pandemic, which saw workers from all industries stepping back and reevaluating their relationship to a five day work week and in-person employment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>It's a big day at Stack Overflow! Our Prosus deal has closed and our latest Dev Survey is live.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In June, I wrote to announce that Prosus, one of the world’s leading technology operators and investors, had agreed to acquire Stack Overflow. Today, I’m pleased to say that the <a href="https://www.prosus.com/news/prosus-closes-acquisition-of-stack-overflow-for-us18-billion/">deal has been finalized</a>. This is a tremendous milestone for our company and community, a testament to the hard work and dedication that have built Stack Overflow over the last 13+ years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re excited to continue working towards our existing goals and priorities with no changes to our focus on creating and maintaining a vibrant community and our core SaaS business model. With Prosus, we can accelerate plans and be even more ambitious about scaling our public and private platforms.</p>



<p>Over the last quarter, we revisited our mission statement to reflect our unwavering commitment to knowledge sharing and consolidated the many versions that have surfaced over the last several years into one:</p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center" id="h-empower-the-world-to-develop-technologythrough-collective-knowledge">Empower the world to develop technology<br>through collective knowledge.</h1>



<p>We, and Prosus, understand that our commitment to spreading knowledge and building community is the engine of our success. Democratizing information is the only way to empower learners to develop the future of technology. We hope to further invest in the community so an even wider group can benefit from it &#8211; technologists in countries around the world who are all on their unique learning journeys.</p>



<h2>Public Platform and Community</h2>



<p>Q2 was a time of strong growth for our public platform. We saw more new accounts being created than ever, with April, May, and June trending at or above our highest levels from last year. Part of the credit here certainly goes to our public platform and community teams, which continue to push improvements to the user experience and work to ensure our sites are becoming more welcoming, inclusive, and diverse. But there are also macro trends at work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we join Prosus’s edtech portfolio, we do so alongside companies like Udemy, Brainly, and Codecademy. The number of people around the globe seeking careers as software developers is increasing. So too is the number of professions, from finance to life sciences to climate studies, where writing code is not the primary task, but is fundamental in transforming those professions to become more automated and to drive innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As our community grows, we must continue to invest in supporting it. As I’ve outlined to all our employees, <strong>keeping the community at our center</strong> is a core value. We’re pleased to announce that we’ve recently hired a new VP of community, Philippe Beaudette. Philippe has a storied career, beginning in the days of AOL chat rooms, through the early days of Wikipedia, and most recently at Reddit. He brings a great wealth of experience in building safe, inclusive communities where users feel empowered to express their curiosity and share their knowledge. We’re thrilled that Philippe, with his deep community background, will be hyper focused on working closely with the community to help make the Stack Exchange ecosystem even more vibrant. You can read his blog post on <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/29/the-loop-our-community-public-platform-roadmap-for-q3-2021/">our upcoming roadmap</a> and listen to a podcast interview with him below.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" height="200px" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless="" src="https://player.simplecast.com/235db03f-7d3c-4266-a048-ccb1345d244b?dark=false"></iframe>



<p>Speaking of hiring, we have over <a href="https://lnkd.in/eBV_G5i">100 open roles</a> across our company. If you want to be part of a high growth organization that works to accomplish a powerful mission at global scale, take a look and see if there is an opportunity available that speaks to you.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We want to communicate through the work that we’re doing and not create more meetings, more time spent figuring out where to look or who to ask. Stack Overflow for Teams plays a big role in InnerSource because it helps us document all these answers that are needed for engineers to move quicker. Stack Overflow helps on unblocking engineers, and that&#8217;s a big thing we didn&#8217;t use to have.”</p><cite>Rocio Montes, Staff Software Engineer, Intuit</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Product</h2>



<p>Q2 saw the launch of a new product, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/collectives">Collectives<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> on Stack Overflow</a>, which aims to increase value for our users, community, and clients by organizing Q&amp;A and Articles around a certain technical topic, for example a programming language or cloud services platform. We had two great customers come onboard to help us launch this product: Google Cloud and Google’s Go Language, and we will be announcing many more Collectives in coming months. Our approach to development is product-led AND community-driven. By learning from and serving our community, we can be a force multiplier for companies that want to empower users of their technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The two Collectives we’ve launched for Google Cloud and GOLang are reaching hundreds of millions of Stack Overflow users.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1896" height="1307" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-google-cloud-go-stats.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18549" srcset="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-google-cloud-go-stats.png 1896w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-google-cloud-go-stats-300x207.png 300w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-google-cloud-go-stats-914x630.png 914w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-google-cloud-go-stats-768x529.png 768w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-google-cloud-go-stats-1536x1059.png 1536w " sizes="(max-width: 1896px) 100vw, 1896px" /><figcaption>Statistics from the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/google-cloud">Google Cloud</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/go">GOLang</a> Collectives. August 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’re excited for this new approach to organizing knowledge and community on Stack Overflow, and have already seen over 10,000 users sign up to follow our Collectives. I believe that Collectives will help our community to organize and share knowledge around clusters of technology, for example the wide array of development happening in the blockchain space. We recently ran a survey on this topic, and got some <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/07/most-developers-believe-blockchain-technology-is-a-game-changer-3/">fascinating results</a>. There are Stack Exchanges focused on <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://cardano.stackexchange.com/">Cardano</a>, <a href="https://iota.stackexchange.com/">Iota</a>, <a href="https://eosio.stackexchange.com/">EOS.IO</a>, <a href="https://tezos.stackexchange.com/">Tezos</a>, and <a href="https://monero.stackexchange.com/">Monero</a>. I’m sure more will emerge as this space continues to grow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/07/most-developers-believe-blockchain-technology-is-a-game-changer-3/"><img loading="lazy" width="2400" height="1256" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pulse-survey-social-want-to-develop.png" alt="Results from the Blockchain survey: 61.85% of those of you who have not developed with blockchain want to." class="wp-image-18552" srcset="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pulse-survey-social-want-to-develop.png 2400w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pulse-survey-social-want-to-develop-300x157.png 300w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pulse-survey-social-want-to-develop-1200x628.png 1200w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pulse-survey-social-want-to-develop-768x402.png 768w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pulse-survey-social-want-to-develop-1536x804.png 1536w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pulse-survey-social-want-to-develop-2048x1072.png 2048w " sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /></a></figure>



<p>Collectives is part of our Reach and Relevance product offerings, and we’ve had an incredible start to this line of business in 2021. Earlier this year we combined our Advertising and Talent products under one umbrella. We moved away from discrete hiring to focus more on advertising and brand awareness. We are seeing tremendous traction in this space, with firms like AWS, JP Morgan Chase, and Accenture coming on board for brand awareness campaigns.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-logos-1.png" alt="AWS, JP Morgan Chase, and Accenture logos" class="wp-image-18557" width="600" height="222" srcset="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-logos-1.png 1200w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-logos-1-300x111.png 300w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-logos-1-768x284.png 768w " sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Some of Stack Overflow’s recent <meta charset="utf-8">brand awareness campaign clients</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Just as there are an ever growing number of new users signing up for the public platform, there is a steady increase in the number of organizations that want to reach developers. Some are looking to hire great talent, others want developers to try their product, and others simply want developers to use their platform, tools, or ecosystem. We can help them do it all, and we do it while respecting developer’s privacy and avoiding invasive tracking.</p>



<p>As I’ve written before, <strong>Predictable and Reliable Financial Performance</strong> is one of our strategic priorities. In Q2 we introduced another new product, sponsored podcasts, and our content marketing business is on track to more than double in size over last year. Put together, Advertising and Collectives delivered an exceptional quarter, the biggest in the company’s history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“The number of daily searches stood out as a healthy sign of people changing their behavior and coming to Stack Overflow for answers. Anecdotal evidence showed that even at this early stage, many actually found what they were looking for and therefore gained value without actively participating. Even the SMEs, who had to put in some extra effort up front, reported noticeable time savings, specifically when a ’hot topic’ had a good SO answer they could just point people to instead of repeating the answer on Slack”</p><cite><meta charset="utf-8">Tzach Zohar, System Architect, Skai</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Q2 also saw continued traction towards our other strategic priority for 2021: <strong>Product-led Transformation</strong>. After our launch of our Freemium Teams tier in Q1, we saw a steady stream of thousands signups and users trying out the Teams product. From storied innovators like <a href="https://stackoverflowsolutions.com/teams/xerox-case-study">Xerox</a> to rising unicorns like <a href="https://stackoverflowsolutions.com/teams/doctolib-case-study">Doctlib</a>, we continue to see an ever growing cohort of organizations leveraging Stack Overflow for Teams in a range of use cases to ultimately innovate faster through knowledge sharing and collaboration.</p>



<p>One key metric we focus on as we evaluate how our users see value in our Teams product is&nbsp; something we call <strong>Knowledge Reuse</strong>. While the number of questions and answers added to a Team are meaningful, we believe the true value is best quantified by understanding how often users are able to quickly find a solution to the problem at hand. On our public site, we note how many people a particular user has reached with their answers. It’s incredible to realize that the contributions of an individual can help tens, even hundreds of millions of others learn and grow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-1200x630.png" alt="Illustration of a Stack Overflow user" class="wp-image-18564" width="840" height="441" srcset="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-1200x630.png 1200w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-300x158.png 300w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-768x403.png 768w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-1536x806.png 1536w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/q2-2021-ceo-user-2048x1075.png 2048w " sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>The same outsized impact happens within private Teams. At companies like Xerox, Doctolib, and Unqork, knowledge is reused hundreds of times a month. That’s hundreds of emails or chat messages avoided, time saved for the person asking the question and for their colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of our most viewed questions on Stack Overflow is a question that asks “What is a NullPointerException, and how do I fix it?” That was asked 12 years and 7 months ago. It has 31 different answers or solutions provided. That question has been viewed 3.2 million times. That&#8217;s 3.2 millions times that knowledge was reused. We have one piece of knowledge on our own internal instance that&#8217;s had more than 1,000 views in the past two years &#8211; How do I submit a Salesforce Case?</p>

<p>Another major impact Teams can have is to break down silos within an organization. Great solutions may not come from the teammate or department you expect. We continue to use Teams internally, where it helps us <strong>learn, share, and grow. </strong>There are great conversations happening across legal, marketing, sales, product, and engineering. <a href="https://stackoverflowsolutions.com/teams/wisetech-case-study">Wisetech Global</a> tells us that at their company all hands, Stack Overflow for Teams has been used to help discuss and debate the best ways to implement some of the company’s core mantras and values. “We have recently been running a program where we&#8217;re taking a number of the mantras that we hold dear in the business and we&#8217;ve been amplifying that to the global audience,” explains Ian Larsen, GM of software operations. “We&#8217;ve been using Stack Overflow for Teams as a discussion forum. It’s a place for people to raise questions, get additional clarity, or just discuss the nuances. So I think that has been great.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We have a highly complex and proprietary tech stack and have recently expanded rapidly. Our senior engineers were spending a lot of their very valuable time answering the same questions to different people. Having our own Stack Overflow (for Teams) setup means they only have to answer it once and can provide code samples, details descriptions etc. It also has the benefit of this knowledge being available outside of our time-zone&#8217;s working hours so our engineers in the US and Asia can get quick, detailed answers without having to wait until our UK office opens. It has significantly helped boost our productivity”</p><cite>Global Cyber Security Provider</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h2>



<p>A year ago I made a commitment to include updates on our diversity and inclusion progress in these quarterly posts. We are making a significant investment in DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) at the company. We are compiling and preparing to share DEI metrics with employees, evolving our hiring practices, rolling out inclusion training to all employees, and we are in the process of hiring a Director of DEI to lead these efforts. We’ve also committed to a quarterly DEI newsletter compiled by our growing number of affinity groups collectively, which is launching this week.</p>



<p>Over the last three months, we’ve also hosted panels featuring employees and external experts open to the full company on issues and experiences facing our Asian &amp; Pacific Islander community and our LGBTQIA+ community. Hearing shared and individual experiences was eye opening, and I truly believe learning about others’ experiences makes us a stronger, more thoughtful organization in the long run.</p>



<p>There is so much work to be done, but we’re continuing to take steps towards a diverse and inclusive culture that we believe sets the tone for the community we foster online.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As we look out to the second half of 2021, there are many big opportunities we are considering. How can we leverage the global scale of Prosus to expand our business and bring a broader cohort of users, from around the world, onto our public platform? How do we enable beginner developers to leverage Stack Overflow so they become engaged participants, not just casual visitors? What kind of strategic partnerships and alliances are possible with other edtech companies, leveraging our scale and their expertise so that Stack Overflow can offer a wider variety of options for finding solutions and learning new skills?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The completion of our deal with Prosus isn’t the only exciting news I get to share today. Today we <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021">published our annual Developer Survey</a>. It contains many fascinating insights, but one in particular stood out to me. For the rising cohort of coders under the age of 18, online resources like videos, websites, and blogs are more popular than books and school combined, a statistic that doesn&#8217;t hold for any of our other age cohorts. Overall the developer profession is full of new joiners, with more than 50% indicating they have been coding for less than a decade, and more than 35% having less than five years in the trade.</p>



<p>So much of what drives us is the desire to empower this new generation of developers and technologists. The resources available to us through this acquisition and the continued growth of our product and public platform give me great confidence that we will continue to unlock new potential, and that we will grow Stack Overflow into an enduring global brand with a vibrant community that continues to empower the world to develop technology through collective knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hello and welcome to the 2021 Developer Survey. This year over 80,000 respondents took the time to share their feedback on the tools and trends that are shaping software development. As always, we are so grateful to those who took the time to participate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year’s survey was a little different than ones in years past. We opened our 2020 survey in February, and by the time we got around to publishing the results, the reality of work and daily life had shifted dramatically for people around the globe. The pandemic continues to exert a strong influence on the shape of our economy and society, so we tried to keep this year’s survey shorter and focused on things outside the traditional office.</p>



<p>We learned a lot about the way developers learn. ﻿For the rising cohort of coders under the age of 18, online resources like videos and blogs are more popular than books and school combined, a statistic that doesn&#8217;t hold for any of our other age cohorts. ﻿﻿Overall the developer profession is full of new joiners, with more than 50% indicating they have been coding for less than a decade, and more than 35% having less than five years in the trade.</p>



<p>Roughly a third of respondents responded to our question on mental health. This is twice the percentage that offered feedback in 2020 and may reflect the growing awareness of mental health&#8217;s importance and the impact of the ongoing pandemic.</p>



<p>Another trend that may be linked to the pandemic is work status. We see a greater percentage of respondents working part-time or in school, while those indicating full time employment decreased. This may reflect the effects of the pandemic, which saw workers from all industries stepping back and reevaluating their relationship to a five day work week and in-person employment.</p>



<p>As always, there were a few new languages on our leaderboards and some interesting shifts among the most Loved, Dreaded, and Wanted technologies. We also introduced a new insight to this section, measuring technologies developers have <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/410519/what-is-worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-and-loved-dreaded-wanted">Worked With vs. Want to Work With.</a> There are some very cool, interactive visuals showing the languages, databases, and frameworks that existing developers want to migrate towards.&nbsp;</p>

</iframe>



<p>Be sure to check out all the data and insights from the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021">full Dev Survey here</a>. Beyond this annual event, we are expanding our research efforts and planning to run a number of smaller, more topically focused surveys throughout the year. We published one on <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/07/most-developers-believe-blockchain-technology-is-a-game-changer-3/">blockchain technology</a> earlier this year and have one about the cloud coming up soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recently updated our mission statement at Stack Overflow. As an organization, we strive to empower the world to develop technology through collective knowledge. Your contributions allow us to build and refine our knowledge of the developer community and the state of software. As always, we will make the data from the survey available to the public shortly, so stay tuned for information on how to download. Thanks for helping us to create this report, please enjoy and share, and we’ll see you again next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hello everyone &#8211; for those who don’t know me yet, I’m Philippe, and I’m the new VP of Community here. Long time listener, first time caller…</p>



<p>I’ve been working with online communities since the days of AOL chat rooms, and have held community roles at Wikipedia and Reddit. You can hear more about my experience and why I’m so excited for this opportunity in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/23/podcast-360-from-aol-chat-rooms-to-wikipedia-reddit-and-now-stack-overflow/?_ga=2.252973706.2055806798.1627566121-2082570158.1626252055">recent podcast episode</a>.</p>





<p>Ok, enough about me. I&#8217;m going to take you through what the Community Management and Public Platform teams accomplished in Q2 and what to expect during Q3.</p>



<h2 id="h-q2-2021-recap">Q2 2021 recap</h2>



<p>Our Community Management team &#8211; directly supporting moderators, curators, and the general user base &#8211; is growing and changing! We’ve added two new community managers, have two more starting in August, and have moved one staff member (me) to a VP role. We’re also opening up two positions on Trust and Safety, the sub-team that investigates various threats to the site and behavioral issues. Check out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here/3299086/community-manager-trust-safety">the job posting</a> and apply if you are qualified!</p>



<h4>Q2 was a busy time for us.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>On the community project side, we completed a number of initiatives: we <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/364556/208518">reset the community ads program</a>, wrote guidance for mods about how to use the mod tools, and began research into reasons for closed questions. We also rewrote some mod templates that were unclear or outdated. The changes will be rolled out to the public platform soon. Along with projects handled largely by our team, we also supported a number of other initiatives throughout the company, such as the deployment of Collectives and the 2021 Dev Survey. Last but not least, after a successful launch last year, we’re excited to be supporting the 2nd annual “<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/367628/the-2021-community-a-thon-has-begun">Community-a-thon</a>” for staff right now.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Public Platform, the product development team that builds features for Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange communities, accomplished the following in Q2:</p>



<ul><li>launched a crazy-fun <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/">April Fool&#8217;s prank</a> that produced some <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/04/19/how-often-do-people-actually-copy-and-paste-from-stack-overflow-now-we-know/">interesting insights</a>.</li><li>wrapped up a multi-quarter initiative to <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/366408/moderator-elections-tools-for-community-managers">make it easier for Community Managers (CMs) to manage moderator elections</a>.</li><li>released <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/363485/new-onboarding-for-review-queues">onboarding guidance</a> to make it easier for both new and experienced users to understand how Review Queues, our system for handling problematic posts, work.</li><li>continued product discovery on the issue of outdated answers on Stack Overflow by <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/407613/outdated-accepted-answers-flagging-exercise-has-begun">collecting and analyzing a data set</a> of less-than-optimal answers.</li></ul>



<h2>Q3 2021 Community Management team roadmap</h2>



<p>Below are the major initiatives we&#8217;ll be focusing on in Q3.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="647" height="295" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-8.30.43-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18502" srcset="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-8.30.43-PM.png 647w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-8.30.43-PM-300x137.png 300w " sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></figure>



<h3>Community Operations</h3>



<h4>Moving some support tickets to Community Ops</h4>



<p>For the operations team, led by <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/943183/">Rosie</a>, one major piece of work that’s happening is that we’re taking over a large support responsibility. For the last half-decade or so, the Stack Overflow support team has been triaging and handling community support emails that really should be handled by community managers. It’s a decent sized lift — about 2,000 a month — and it will require that we update our existing templates as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Three vote closure adaptation</h4>



<p>We will also continue our experiments with the three-vote closure adaptation, which allows for three votes on a close/reopen task rather than the customary five. We ran a pilot program for this last quarter, and we’re into an analysis phase at this point, prior to making decisions about where and how to implement the adjustment.</p>



<h4>Site life-cycle analysis</h4>



<p>I know that many of you will be thrilled to know that we’re looking at site lifecycles &#8211; from the beginning of the nascent site in<a href="https://area51.stackexchange.com"> Area 51</a> through the beta process and into graduation as a “full” site. We’ll be trying to standardize some practices for sites to establish a clean and clear roadmap for new sites. We are also hoping to create a fair and repeatable process for evaluating sites that are in danger of being shut down.&nbsp; This will include determining what the process should be for having their members join a similar community (while importing their questions and reputation there). A component of this work is evaluating sites that are currently flagged as “beta” and determining whether they should have that label removed.</p>



<h3>Trust and Safety</h3>



<h4>New employee onboarding refresh</h4>



<p>We’re updating a ton of documentation for new team members. The “ramp” time to get a new hire to become fully functional as a community-facing Stack employee is a long one, but history tells us that the better organized and carefully crafted the onboarding process, the easier onboarding is for new teammates. Trust and Safety work has traditionally not been an area of focus for us, so <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/508266/cesar-m?tab=profile">Cesar’s</a> team will be helping to update the onboarding process to reflect their work and to give solid advice to those who join the company.</p>



<h4>Closed question reasons&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The T&amp;S team is also working on evaluating closed questions and the reasons why they are closed. They’re looking into whether it makes sense to standardize some options for this — for instance, should all sites have an option to close questions for a particular set of reasons? If so, what should those reasons be? What are the requirements to have a question reopened once closed under those reasons? Once this work is done, they will work to create a set of guidelines for closing that are standardized across the network.</p>



<p>Oh, and with a little bit of luck, we will onboard a couple of new community managers to this team as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Curator Support</h3>



<p>At the same time, the curator support team, led by <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/296470/juan-m?tab=profile">Juan</a>, will continue its focus on our moderators and power users. This quarter, they’ll be onboarding two new community managers, in addition to their standard work (mod surveys, swag, mod/staff quarterly meeting), so they will take on only one additional project: mod tenure (the emeritus program), which is a project that looks at the overall arc of tenure for moderators. It also looks at ways to honor those who have done excellent work for the communities they serve for some time who may wish to step down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will likely form the corpus of a “moderator emeritus” program, one which will allow communities to recognize and honor those who have served as moderators, while also giving them a consistent and recognizable stable of mentors for new mods and new users. We will recognize these emeritus moderators with some icon similar to the diamond that mods wear today. They will also retain access to a more limited set of the moderator tools, to allow them to surge in and support existing moderators if needed, but also allow them a graceful transition out of the role.</p>



<h2>Q3 2021 Public Platform roadmap</h2>



<p>These are our top priorities for Q3.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="638" height="259" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-8.34.08-PM-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18504" srcset="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-8.34.08-PM-1.png 638w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-8.34.08-PM-1-300x122.png 300w " sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /><figcaption>Q3 2021 Public Platform roadmap</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Review queues</h3>



<p>We are wrapping up the final phase of this longstanding project by making changes to how posts flow through the various queues. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>splitting up the First posts queue into First questions and First answers, so that experienced users can more easily evaluate the quality of new users&#8217; posts.</li><li>redesigning how <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/367231/changing-the-question-reopening-experience">closed posts become eligible for reopening</a>.</li><li>Making it easier for reviewers to take concrete actions in the First questions, First answers, and Late answers queues.</li></ul>



<h3>Outdated answers</h3>



<p>We are continuing our product-discovery work on Stack Overflow answer quality by conducting experiments related to how we sort answers. We will be testing the effect of sorting by highest score vs. pinning the answer that the question asker viewed as most helpful to the top. This is a long-standing community request that we hope to finally address. We will also be exploring the concept of a Trending sort that weights recent votes more heavily than older votes.</p>



<h3>New user onboarding</h3>



<p>We are continuing product discovery on how to best guide new users through the process of successfully asking their first questions. We will experiment with the copy shown to new users when asking questions to help them learn about site mechanics and successfully complete their tasks. In addition, we&#8217;re conducting extensive research on different ways new users can engage with the Stack Overflow community and get the support and information they need to start off on the right foot.</p>



<h3>Stacks editor alpha test</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/index.html">Dwarf Fortress</a> is one of those oddball passion projects that’s broken into Internet consciousness. It’s a free game where you play either an adventurer or a fortress full of dwarves in a randomly generated fantasy world. The simulation runs deep, with new games creating multiple civilizations with histories, mythologies, and artifacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has become notorious, and rightly so. Individual dwarves have emotional states, favorite gems, and grudges. And it all takes place in an ASCII interface that looks imposing to newbies, but feels like the text crawl in <em>The Matrix</em>: craftsdwarf, river, legendary megabeast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entire game is product of one developer, Tarn Adams, aka Toady One, who has been working on Dwarf Fortress since 2002. For the first four years it was a part time project, but since 2006 it’s been full time. He writes all the code himself, although his brother helps out with design and creates stories based on the game. Up until now, he’s relied on donations to keep him going, but he’s currently working on a version with pixel graphics and a revamped UI that will be available for purchase on Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I reached out to Tarn Adams to see how he’s managed a single, growing codebase over 15+ years, the perils of pathing, and debugging dead cats. Our conversation below has been edited for clarity.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: What programming languages and other technologies do you use? Basically, what&#8217;s your stack? Has that changed over the 15-20 years you&#8217;ve been doing this?</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: DF is some combination of C and C++, not in some kind of standard obeying way, but sort of a mess that&#8217;s accreted over time. I&#8217;ve been using Microsoft Visual Studio since MSVC 6, though now I&#8217;m on some version of Visual Studio Community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use OpenGL and SDL to handle the engine matters. We went with those because it was easier to port them to OSX and Linux, though I still wasn&#8217;t able to do that myself of course. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;d use something like Unity or Unreal now if I had the choice since I don&#8217;t know how to use either of them. But handling your own engine is also a real pain, especially now that I&#8217;m doing something beyond text graphics. I use FMOD for sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this has been constant over the course of the project, except that SDL got introduced a few years in so we could do the ports. On the mechanical side of the game, I don&#8217;t use a lot of outside libraries, but I&#8217;ve occasional picked up some random number gen stuff—I put in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne Twister</a> a long while ago, and most recently I adopted <a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/misc/splitmix64.c">SplitMix64</a>, which was featured in a talk at the last Roguelike Celebration.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: What are the challenges in developing a single project for so long? Do you think this is easier to do by yourself? That is, because you wrote every line, is it easier to maintain and change?</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: It&#8217;s easy to forget stuff! Searching for &#8216;;&#8217;, which is a loose method but close enough, we&#8217;re up to 711,000 lines, so it&#8217;s just not possible to keep it all in my head now. I try to name my variables and objects consistently and memorably, and I leave enough <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/">comments</a> around to remind myself of what&#8217;s going on when I arrive at a spot of code. Sometimes it takes several searches to find the exact thread I&#8217;m trying to tug on when I go and revisit some piece of the game I haven&#8217;t touched for a decade, which happens quite a bit. I&#8217;d say most changes are focused only on certain parts of the game, so there is kind of an active molten core that I have a much better working knowledge of. There are a few really crusty bits that I haven&#8217;t looked at since before the first release in 2006.</p>



<p>Regarding the relative ease of doing things by myself, certainly for me, who has no experience working on a large multi-person project, this is the way to go! People obviously get good at doing it the other way, for example over in the AAA games context, and clearly multiple engineers are needed over there to get things done on time. I&#8217;d be hesitant to say I can go in and change stuff faster than they can, necessarily, since I haven&#8217;t worked in that context before, but it&#8217;s true that I don&#8217;t have any team-oriented or bureaucratic hurdles to jump through when I want to make an alteration. I can just go do it. But I also have to do it alone.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: What&#8217;s the biggest refactor/change that you had to make?</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: There have been some refactors that have lasted for months, redoing certain data structures and so forth, though I&#8217;m not sure anything is ever a refactor strictly here since there&#8217;s always opportunities to push the mechanics forward simultaneously and it makes sense to do so when the code knowledge is fresh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding the Z coordinate to make the game mechanically 3D (while still being text) was another one, and really the most mind-numbing thing I&#8217;ve probably ever done. Just weeks and weeks and weeks of taking logic and function calls that relied on X and Y and seeing how a Z fits in there.</p>



<p>Making the item system polymorphic was ultimately a mistake, but that was a big one.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: Why was this was a mistake?</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: When you declare a class that&#8217;s a kind of item, it locks you into that structure much more tightly than if you just have member elements. It&#8217;s nice to be able to use virtual functions and that kind of thing, but the tradeoffs are just too much. I started using a &#8220;tool&#8221; item in the hierarchy, which started to get various functionality, and can now support anything from a stepladder to a beehive to a mortar (and pestle, separately, ha ha), and it just feels more flexible, and I wish every crafted item in the game were under that umbrella.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do a lot of procedural generation, and if we wanted to, say, generate an item that acts partially like one thing and partially like another, it&#8217;s just way harder to do that when you are locked down in a class hierarchy. Adding things like <a href="https://jlbp.dev/what-is-a-diamond-dependency-conflict">diamond dependencies</a> and all that just end up tying you in knots when there are cleaner ways to do it. If different components can just be turned off and on, it&#8217;s easier, and allows you to do more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think some game developers refer to this as an entity component system, though it&#8217;s my understanding that harder-core optimizer people think of that as something else where you&#8217;re actually breaking things down by individual fields. Using a single object with different allocated subobjects is almost certainly worse for cache misses, which is a whole other thing, but the benefits in organization, flexibility, and extensibility just can&#8217;t be ignored, and the different subfields of the tool item aren&#8217;t used so often that it becomes an optimization issue.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: Did you run into any issues moving from 32 bit to 64 bit? That feels like one of those things that was huge at the time but has become pretty accepted.</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: Not at all! I&#8217;m struggling to think of a single issue. Fortunately for us, we already had our byte sizes under control pretty well, since it comes up saving and loading the worlds; the format needed to be nailed down back when we set that up, especially because we&#8217;ve had to deal with endian stuff between OSes and all that. And we don&#8217;t do any gnarly pointer operations or other stuff that might have gotten us in trouble. It just ended up being really good code for 64 bit conversion due to our other practices, entirely by accident. The main issue was just getting the time together to make the change, and then it didn&#8217;t end up taking nearly as long as I thought it would.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: I&#8217;ve seen other games similar to DF die on their pathfinding algorithms.What do you use and how do you keep it efficient?</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: Yeah, the base algorithm is only part of it. We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*</a>, which is fast of course, but it&#8217;s not good enough by itself. We can&#8217;t take advantage of some of the innovations on that (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_point_search">jump point</a>) since our map changes so much. Generally, people have used approaches that add various larger structures on top of the map to cut corners, and because of the changing map, these just take too long to maintain, or are otherwise a hassle. So our approach has been to just keep track of connected components reachable by walking. These are pretty easy to update even when the map changes quickly, though it does involve some flood-filling. For instance, if water cuts the fortress in half, it needs to flood out from one side and update a whole half of the fortress to a new index, but once that&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s good, generally. Then that allows us to cut almost all failed A* calls from the game—our agents just need to query component numbers, and if the component numbers are the same, they know the call will succeed.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fast to maintain, but the downside is that the component indices are maintained for walking only. This means that flying creatures, for instance, don&#8217;t have global pathfinding intelligence that&#8217;s any different from a walker. In combat and a few other situations, we use short-range flood fills with their actual logic to give them some advantages though. But it&#8217;s not ideal for them.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ll attempt other structures here to make it work any better. For our map sizes, they&#8217;ve all failed, including some outside attempts. Of course, it might be possible with a really concerted effort, and I&#8217;ve seen other games that have managed, for instance, some rectangular overlays and so forth that seem promising, but I&#8217;m not sure how volatile or large their maps were.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most simple idea would just be something like adding a new index for fliers, but that&#8217;s a large memory and speed hit, since we&#8217;d need to maintain two indices at once, and one is bad enough. More specific overlays can track their pathing properties (and then you path through the overlays instead of the tiles), but they are hard and slow to maintain as the map changes. There are various other ideas floating around, like tracking stairs, or doing some limited path caching, and there are probably some gains to be made there. We are certainly at the edge of what we can currently support in terms of agents and map complexity, so something&#8217;ll have to give if we want to get more out of it.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: On that note, you&#8217;re simulating a lot of things all at once—how do you manage so many so many actors asynchronously (or do you)?</em></p>



<p>A: If we&#8217;re talking about asynchronous as in multithreading, then no, we don&#8217;t do any of that, aside from the graphical display itself. There&#8217;s a lot of promise here, even with microthreading, which the community has helped me out with, but I haven&#8217;t had time to dive into. I don&#8217;t have any experience and it&#8217;s a bug-prone thing.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: Have you tried other projects/technologies alongside DF?</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: Sure! The side project folder that&#8217;s migrated between computers for the last ten years or so has about 90 projects in it. Some of them lasted for days, some for multiple years. They are mostly other games, almost always in other genres, but there are also a few DF helper projects, like the myth generator prototype. Nothing close to seeing the light of day, but it&#8217;s fun to play around.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: With your ~90 side projects, have you explored any other programming languages? If so, any favorites?</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: Ha ha, nope! I&#8217;m more of a noodler over on the design side, rather than with the tech. I&#8217;m sure some things would really speed up the realization of my designs though, so I should probably at least learn some scripting and play around with threading more. People have even been kind enough to supply some libraries and things to help out there, but it&#8217;s just difficult to block side project time out for tech learning when my side project time is for relaxing.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong><em>: You have the most interesting release notes. What&#8217;s your favorite bug and what caused it?</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: It&#8217;s probably boring for me to say, but I just can&#8217;t beat the drunken cat bug. There&#8217;ve been a few videos made about it by this point. That was the one where the cats were showing up dead all over the tavern floor, and it turned out they were ingesting spilled alcohol when they cleaned their paws. One number was off in the ingest-while-cleaning code, and it sent them through all the symptoms of alcohol poisoning (which we added when we spruced up venomous creatures.)</p>

<p>This week we chat with Max Horstmann, a software developer at Stack Overflow. He details our company&#8217;s experience setting up a Kubernetes cluster, turning that into a managed service through cloud providers, and more recently, using Kubernetes to host what we call PR Environments. Based on this, Max argues that Kubernetes is no longer too challenging for startups to consider using early on.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last month, we announced the launch of Collectives<sup>TM</sup>, places within Stack Overflow that are a little bit more concentrated, a little bit more specialized. They’re mini communities around certain programming languages, products, or services in Stack Overflow where developers can engage directly with the companies and individuals who know the technology best. Each Collective is smaller than a full exchange, larger than a single tag, and an easier way of narrowing down all of the content on Stack Overflow when working with specific tech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re excited that this product is finally live in front of our community of users, and we wanted to take a deep dive into how we designed Collectives, starting from the initial ideation to all the decisions and considerations that led to what it is today. This should give you some insight into how we thought about the product and its use.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-public-version-of-our-private-version">A public version of our private version</h2>



<p>Collectives was an idea that had been kicking around for a while. For years, we had seen individuals share knowledge about technical products freely. Some companies even provided unofficial (or <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/30/why-sencha-is-moving-its-support-forums-to-stack-overflow/">official</a>) tech support by answering questions on their products. We had explored the idea of providing a home page for a technology or company within Stack Overflow, but never figured out a good implementation of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, at the Stack Overflow meetup in Austin, Texas, the product team did a buildup and tear down of that idea, an exercise where we collectively &#8220;tear down&#8221; an idea by identifying potential pitfalls and risks, and then build it back up stronger by addressing major concerns and incorporating additional perspectives. One of the biggest problems we found with the idea was that you’d either be moving or duplicating content. Moving content would remove years of curation from Stack Overflow and remove credit from those that helped create the content. Duplicating the content would create two repositories that needed upkeep and add unnecessary cognitive load to users on where to go for the information. In either case, you’d need to create a new user base for this content in the new location.</p>



<p>But in the buildup, the folks on the Reach and Relevance team saw this as an opportunity for companies to make a positive contribution to the site without taking anyone outside of the public Stack Overflow site or moving content around. The idea was to organize content and put companies around the already built communities, which is where they want to be.</p>



<p>When we got back from the meetup, we started a traditional five-day design sprint: the first day was understanding, the second day diverging, third converging, fourth day prototype, and fifth day test. During this sprint, we came up with the problems that this product would solve:</p>



<ul><li>Enable organizations to build relationships with the Stack Overflow community in a way that <strong>improves</strong> Stack Overflow as a resource for developers.&nbsp;</li><li>Provide unique data showing trends and insights to companies so they can better <strong>understand developer needs</strong>, measure impact, and see our unique value.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>At the end of the sprint, we had a few different ideas, including allowing users to post on behalf of an organization, an organization recommending an answer, a homepage to curate and interact with the organization, and a dashboard for the organization to learn about their community and users.</p>



<p>Our initial solutions were presented to a small group of potential clients and users with positive results. It took a few months before we garnered enough interest from customers to justify moving forward. We had to move quickly in order to get the product ready for an upcoming conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to meet this new deadline, we ran research sprints. Every two weeks, research and product design would get together and decide what we wanted to tackle, then research would design a study, run it, and come back with recommendations. Then we would design based off those recommendations. Altogether there were nine<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/25/user-research-behind-collectives/"> research sprints</a>.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest takeaways from these sprints were that users didn’t want Stack Overflow to feel like a social network and that they wanted the answer ranking to remain the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-a-name-recognized-members">What’s in a name: Recognized members</h2>



<p>Looking back at the problems we defined during the design sprint, we wanted Collectives and the organizations that took part to improve Stack Overflow. Recognized Members was our first feature planned to solve that problem. This role is intended to increase the quantity and quality of contributions from an organization to the community. This applies not only to employees, but allows organizations to recognize and discover users that already contribute to Stack Overflow successfully.&nbsp; We were trying to get more people to answer the right questions or recommend the right answers. The idea that these subject matter experts of the organization could be new users of Stack Overflow and would contribute high quality answers and recommendations alongside seasoned community members at the same level within the collective was a driving motivator for this project.</p>



<p>Originally, the term for “Recognized Members” needed to include both experts within the community and employees of the organization. It started as “Verified;” that was too close to social media. We also tested affiliate, partner, expert, and more. There were terms that the clients really liked, like expert, but then we showed it to users and they disliked it immediately. Users felt that “Expert” was a weighted title that added too much pressure—you’re expected to know absolutely everything about the technology. They also felt it was disrespectful to other experts on the site that wouldn&#8217;t have this badge.</p>



<p>By the time we went back the fifth time, “Recognized” was one of the original ideas that had tested fairly neutral—it wasn’t picked as a favorite, but didn&#8217;t get any negative feedback. We tested it again. That&#8217;s the term that best fit the expectation of what we wanted that role to be. So wording was fun.</p>



<p>The other challenge was how to highlight these users and their answers in the collective. We started with “Recognized Member” written in bright orange text. When you start peppering that around the site in different areas, it gets very long. Then we paired the user name with an icon that shows up alongside it so that when space is limited, we could display the icon by itself. Originally, it was a checkmark, but that just didn&#8217;t fly—too much like Twitter. We tried colored backgrounds, but that felt too bold. We wanted to make sure the weighting was appropriate, but still recognizable. Eventually, we settled on a star as the icon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our first design sprints, we made the decision to not do employee labels in order to reduce cognitive load and minimize the amount of new user types that we were introducing. However, our potential clients wanted to differentiate between actual employees of the company versus somebody from the community that they&#8217;re recognizing. Some potential clients even had this as a legal requirement. We tested this with users, and they agreed that the information should be upfront and transparent so users know who is official and who is a community user that knows their stuff.</p>



<p>At this point, some of the nuances around Employees and Recognized Members began to reveal themselves. If someone leaves the company and are no longer an Employee, what happens to the badge on their answer? Do Employee and Recognized statuses stay on the question if that was true when they answered? We don&#8217;t want to label somebody as an employee when they&#8217;re not—there can be legal repercussions around that as well. Alternatively, if someone was Recognized when they answered a question, we want to keep highlighting that answer because they were still a recognized authority at the time they answered.</p>



<p>On top of all this, we had to work around the existing codebase. We had to be mindful of our developers and public users, especially anything that would need extra time from the Public Platform or Architecture team; we couldn&#8217;t make large changes. Plus, our engineering team had spent the last three years eliminating tech debt and improving stability; they didn’t want to endanger that by making large codebase changes. Just because we&#8217;re introducing this new feature quickly, it doesn&#8217;t mean we could disturb existing community functionality. This is supposed to add additional value to Public Platform users, not mess with their experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-new-content-type-for-the-community">A new content type for the community</h2>



<p>We knew from survey results that Articles were of interest to users, something that we had already been using successfully in Teams. Articles were present in most of the research sessions, and it went through a lot of iteration and discovery. Phase one was pretty easy: port Articles over from Stack Overflow for Teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We heard very early on in research about our <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/07/21/introducing-stack-overflow-documentation-beta/">Documentation project</a> and how it was painful for the community when that failed. Along with the designer that originally worked on documentation, we examined why it failed and what went wrong. When that feature first came out, some users flooded the site with low quality documentation in order to inflate their reputation. Much of the design effort here was to make sure that the quality was going to be higher and there wasn&#8217;t going to be the same reputation grab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The power of these Collectives isn’t just in the people who run them, it’s in the Members. We want any Member to be able to propose or submit a draft to the Collective for review. In the near future, we’ll launch an Article proposal flow, but we’re still sorting out the nuances of moderation and review. During user research, we heard from a lot of users who don’t want this to become just another blog site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to get higher quality Articles, we’ll also want to enable other users to propose edits.&nbsp; Part of this future feature, will allow authors to add any Member as an editor. But we need to put in extra safeguards when a Member goes back and makes edits to their article. This involves another type of approval queue. We want to avoid someone sneaking malicious content into an article without external review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, there&#8217;s a lot of research into outdated answers and downvoting on the public site. People just tend to close, delete, or downvote questions if they&#8217;re wrong or duplicate. Newer users feel like this poses a barrier to the site—they don’t know why their question was downvoted so it feels a little hostile. Imagine how that feels on an Article that someone put a lot of work into. We&#8217;re trying to promote the feedback mechanism on Articles to avoid that. If you&#8217;re going to downvote, explain why and help the author.</p>



<p>A concern with the feedback mechanism is that the feedback goes to the author in a private section. Only the author, collective Employees, and Recognized Members can see it. There&#8217;s definitely moderation concerns because anywhere that someone can send a private message to somebody on the internet usually turns bad. One of our clients was concerned that some of their members might not want to write an article in fear of just getting downvoted or worse because of their gender or their race. They&#8217;re opening themselves up to potential backlash just based on who they are, which they&#8217;ve seen before in the developer community.</p>



<p>Unlike questions, Articles can’t be answered. They still have comments, though comments on questions are for flagging something, edits, or feedback on the question. That doesn&#8217;t really make sense on Articles. Typically, people use comment sections to discuss ideas that were written in the Article. We tested calling comments on articles ‘discussion,’ and it tested pretty well. But there&#8217;s a lot of new stuff coming with Collectives. So we pulled back on that plan to wait and see how Articles does in the first place. For now, we still want to encourage interaction with these Articles, so instead of the small “Add a comment link,” we auto-expanded the comment text box to give it more visual weight.</p>



<h2 id="h-collective-health">Collective health</h2>



<p>Stack Overflow has a heavy gamification component, so we wanted to use that within a collective. When we went to look at designing a Member’s page, we wanted it to be more than a list of members; it should be a little bit more interactive and have a little bit of that competitive spirit. So we pivoted the feature into a leaderboard. We have several leaderboards—the overall one on Stack Overflow, tag-specific ones, ones on Stack Overflow for Teams—so we looked at these and external leaderboards to see what worked and what didn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest change is that we highlight where you are on the leaderboard. Not everyone will be on the first page, even the first five pages, but it&#8217;s still fun to be able to track your progress as you learn and level up. The top three on the leaderboard will get a trophy beside their user card throughout the collective. Employees and Recognized Members will be competing on the same leaderboard; our research showed that users appreciated seeing these users high up on the leaderboard. It meant that the organization behind the collective was actually engaged and putting something back into the site and into the community.</p>



<p>On the client side of things, we still wanted to provide that insights dashboard. We’d heard from users of our Stack Overflow for Teams dashboards that the information in them was great, but that they didn’t know what to do with it. At first, we tried cutting the amount of information down—location, time of day, and other pieces of data got cut. But still, clients ran into the same problem: here’s the info, now what? If my Collective is doing badly, what can I do to make it better?</p>



<p>We were constantly prioritizing during the design of this dashboard. The deadline kept moving, so we always felt like we were up against this tight deadline and we constantly needed to prioritize over other items. Sometimes, one thing would be the most important and other times, it was something else. Constant communication, prioritization exercises, and time management were our daily lives. One of our biggest trip-ups was the amount of times that we had to go through and iterate on it. The team was split on whether to do it at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just reports and metrics could help prove return on investment with clients. But we wanted something that would ensure that Collectives succeeded, so the insights dashboard evolved into Actions for you, a list of tasks that we think the collective experts should do to make the place successful. It highlights problem areas, so if a Recognized Member has a little bit of time, they know where their efforts will pay off the most. Maybe there’s a lot of unanswered questions. Maybe questions have answers, but those answers need recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with these highlights, we included a weekly tasks list, steps that the collective team should take every week to help their space thrive. The collective Recognized Members and Admins know exactly what they need to do—write two articles, answer ten questions—and tick off those boxes as the tasks are completed. Next week, it refreshes. It helps level set what a reasonable amount of effort looks like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the future, the task list may have more dynamic items supported by data, nudges to invite more Recognized Members or encourage more edits. When we tested that feature with some of the moderators and high rep users, they all really liked it and requested that we bring it to the mod review queue, which was a good confirmation we were on the right path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting the dashboards up and running was one of design&#8217;s biggest challenges, but it was worth it—it looks great.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-we-re-just-getting-started">And we’re just getting started</h2>



<p>Google Cloud and the Go programming language were the first Collectives to launch and those organizations and their users are seeing the value of the work we put in. More technology providers and more features are on the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, we’re looking at the ability to pin certain content to the top of the list, perhaps as a way for the collective to promote a certain article for a limited amount of time so that everybody can see the official answer immediately. We’re also looking for ways that the organization can ask and discuss topics with their collective Members. But we want to make sure this adds value to users and it remains within the confines of the collective.These are a few of the features that will really make Collectives feel unique.</p>



<p>As always, we’re trying to lower the friction between technology workers and the answers that they need to get the job done. Technology companies want to be able to engage with those people directly, and Collectives gives both groups a space to interact and share knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;re starting a new project from scratch—a new app, service, or website—your main concern usually isn’t how to operate it at web scale with high availability. Rather, you’re likely to focus on building the right thing for the customer you’re targeting or finding product market fit. If you’re creating an MVP for a startup, you need to get to that before scaling, otherwise, who are you scaling for? If you’re a developer at an enterprise, you want to make sure that you’re meeting the expectations and needs of the business. Operating at scale is, at best, a tomorrow problem.</p>



<p>Hence, when it comes to choosing the right set of technologies, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/29/why-kubernetes-getting-so-popular/">Kubernetes</a>—commonly associated with large, distributed systems—might not be on your radar right now. After all, it comes with a significant amount of overhead: setting up and operating a cluster, containerizing your app, defining services, deployments, load-balancers, and so on. This may look like massive overkill at the early stage, and you might think that your time would be better spent on other tasks, such as coding the first couple of iterations of your actual app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we started building Stack Overflow in 2008, we didn’t have that choice. There was no Docker (2013), no Kubernetes (2014). Cloud computing was in its infancy: Azure had just launched (2008), and Amazon Web Services was about two years old. What we built was designed for specific hardware and made a lot of assumptions about it. Now that we’re modernizing our codebase and moving to the cloud, there’s a fair amount of work we have to put in to make Kubernetes and containers work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going through this process has given us a new perspective. If you’re building a new app today, it might be worth taking a closer look at making it cloud-native and using Kubernetes from the jump. The effort to set up Kubernetes is less than you think. Certainly, it’s less than the effort it would take to refactor your app later on to support containerization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are three reasons why building your app on Kubernetes from the start might not necessarily be such a bad idea anymore.</p>



<h2 id="h-managed-kubernetes-does-the-heavy-lifting">Managed Kubernetes does the heavy lifting</h2>



<p>At Stack Overflow, when we set up our first in-house Kubernetes cluster a couple of years ago, it took us close to a week to get everything up and running: provision virtual machines, install, configure, configure, configure. Once the cluster was up, there was ongoing maintenance. What we ultimately realized was that Kubernetes was great for us—but we wanted somebody else to run it.</p>



<p>Today, managed Kubernetes services such as Amazon’s Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Microsoft’s Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Google’s Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) allow you to set up your own cluster literally in minutes. For example, in AKS, you can just click a few buttons in the portal and fill out a couple of forms:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xLyJO49MtMQUGP0e7HGS-GmcEtKd3qRq6TyKtt6ep5NZjfX4VUq8fEgoz27uQgLKsDwpb6TP8jQrnM5vS4_joH7FAiNEIEgFNoVHEeP4pW9Jp8K-r41rwTdycZX3r3rsof5vMqjT" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is convenient, but you might wanna stop short of actually creating the cluster at the end of the workflow. Go through the wizard, but don’t click that blue “Create” button at the end! Instead, download the configuration you just created as an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/">ARM template</a> and check it into your source control system. Now you have the best of both worlds—ease of use and infrastructure as code (IaC)!</p>



<p>Once you’re set up here, there’s little left to do once you start scaling your application except write bigger checks to your cloud provider. Any additional resource allocation is easy. The problems that come with scale—fault tolerance, load balancing, traffic shaping—are already handled. At no point will you hit that moment of being overwhelmed with success; you future-proofed your app without too much extra effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-stay-somewhat-cloud-agnostic">You can stay (somewhat) cloud agnostic</h2>



<p>If your project is successful, chances are that technology decisions made in the early stages will still have an impact months or years down the road. Stack Overflow, for instance, was <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/09/21/what-was-stack-overflow-built-with/">originally written</a> in C#. 13 years later, it’s still written in C#, but it used to be, too. Occasionally someone (ahem) suggests that we rewrite it in Node.js. That’s still never happened.</p>



<p>The same can be said about dependencies on cloud services. You might build your new app on top of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) products like Amazon’s EC2. Or maybe you’re starting to take dependencies on platform as a service (PaaS) offerings such as Microsoft’s Azure SQL. But are you willing to make a long-term commitment to the cloud providers behind them at this stage? If you don’t know yet where your journey is going to take you, maybe you’d prefer to stay cloud agnostic for a little longer.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to infrastructure as code: throwing a tool such as <a href="https://www.terraform.io">Terraform</a> into the mix is going to help you with staying cloud agnostic to some degree. It provides a unified toolkit and configuration language (<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl">HCL</a>) to manage your resources across different cloud and infrastructure providers. Your app is unlikely to be truly cloud agnostic, however, in the sense that you’ll be able to just switch your cloud provider as easily as your internet or electricity provider at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a good discussion on this topic in HashiCorp’s forum: <a href="https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/is-terraform-really-cloud-agnostic/5980">Is Terraform really cloud agnostic?</a> As one of the commenter points out:</p>



<p>&gt; “A Kubernetes cluster is a good example of an abstraction over compute resources: there are many hosted and self-managed implementations of it on different platforms, all of which offer a common API and common set of capabilities.”</p>



<p>This sums it up nicely! It’s still not a perfect abstraction. For example, each cloud provider is likely to have its own custom way of implementing things like public load balancers and persistent volumes in Kubernetes. It’s still be fair to say if you’re building on Kubernetes, you’re going to stay cloud agnostic to a certain degree.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-easily-spin-up-new-environments-as-many-as-you-like">You can easily spin up new environments—as many as you like!</h2>



<p>Kubernetes is usually seen as a way to manage your production infrastructure. But here at Stack Overflow, we’ve been using it to manage our test environments on the fly. We&#8217;re using Kubernetes to host what we call <em>PR Environments</em>. Every pull request can be run in an isolated test environment at the push of a button:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VMEnAyZjE5zyUkOdwnxAOQ9FEYf5SkP5O7cAlS6887oHqmBEgU7gH5TE2DUDT49XOk2x_77ik-lAnDw705__6zBbVLtVeE2Ja6zmEgXnqbQa1aOzhCu1lRRsLGZoL81OpGyvcYXS" alt=""/></figure>



<p>And when we say “isolated environment”, we mean <em>everything</em>: the app itself (with the code changes in the PR branch) with its own dedicated instances of SQL Server, Redis, Elasticsearch, and additional services pieces. All spun up from scratch within minutes and running in a handful of containers in a dedicated <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/">namespace</a>, just for you and anyone who’s interested in your PR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn’t something we invented; other organizations have been using this concept. The idea is that every code change goes into a version control system like Git through a pull request. Other developers will review the code, but the code won’t tell the whole story. You want to see the code in action. Normally, you’d have to download all the code locally, compile, and run it. That could be simple, but if you’re running a large application that draws code from multiple repos or—have mercy—a microservice architecture, then you may run into several hours of debugging.</p>



<p>Even better, let’s say you’ve squashed all of the commits for a new feature into a single one and are committing it as a single PR. Send that PR environment to sales or marketing as a single link so that they can preview the feature in action. If your sales team wants to demo the app with specific features or custom builds, send them a PR environment link. You won’t have to spend time walking your less technical colleagues through the build process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of groundwork was required to get to this point. First off, running classic .NET Framework in Windows Containers wasn’t really an avenue we wanted to pursue. It’s possible in theory—Windows support has been available in Kubernetes since v1.19—but the Docker/Kubernetes ecosystem is really more centered around Linux. Thankfully, our migration to .NET Core was already underway, so we decided to bet on Linux containers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, of course, came with its own set of challenges. When you’re dealing with a 10+ year old codebase, you’re likely going to find assumptions about the infrastructure it’s running on: hardcoded file paths (including our favorite: forward slash vs. backslashes), service URLs, configuration, and so on. But we got there eventually, and now we’re in a place where we can spin up an arbitrary number of test instances of Stack Overflow, the Stack Exchange network, and our Teams product on our auto-scaling Kubernetes cluster. What a time to be alive!</p>



<p>Looking back at the early days of Stack Overflow, having this kind of tooling available back then would have been a game changer. In the early stages of building a product, you typically want to build, measure, and learn as much and as fast as possible. Using containers and Kubernetes will allow you to build the tooling for that <em>and</em> future-proof you in case you’re going to scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, should you use Kubernetes from day one? Maybe! It still depends, of course, on your specific project, your requirements, and your priorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But have you been saying “we don’t need Kubernetes because we don’t have product market fit yet”? Take a closer look, and maybe you’ll find yourself saying “we need Kubernetes <em>because</em> we don’t have product market fit yet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“Move fast and break things” sounds great on a t-shirt when you’re building a calculator and the greatest risk is a minor miscalculation. Consider a civil engineer working on bridges and tunnels—would we be comfortable if they wore a t-shirt with the motto “known shippable”?&nbsp;</p>



<p>No, because we want to be assured that those engineers whom we entrust to build these critical systems have designed them for structural integrity, safety of the users, and the longevity to serve a generation of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We software engineers are in the same boat now. The things our community builds are awe-inspiring and wonderful, and the world is eager to participate in our invention. But with that comes a duty of care to those that don’t understand the inner workings of software or data processing, to build systems that respect those individuals, and to ensure the integrity and safety of the systems we provide society. The term of art for this consideration is “data privacy,” but in practice it’s the “respect” concept that may be more apt. Respectful systems are ones where choices are presented transparently to users, and the information users elect to share with the system remains under their control at all times. It doesn’t seem like too much to ask, right? In our field, it’s becoming table stakes.</p>



<p>The good news is, it doesn’t mean we can’t move fast. To quote the endlessly thoughtful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Patil">DJ Patil</a>, we can “move purposefully and fix things.” <strong>The key to combining privacy and innovation, rather than pitting them against one another, is baking privacy into the SDLC. Analogous to application security&#8217;s (AppSec) upstream shift into the development cycle, privacy belongs at the outset of development, not as an afterthought.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-compliance-vs-respect">Compliance vs. respect</h2>



<p>There are two ways to look at the recent emergence of regulatory interest in our field: an oppressive tax on the agility of our industry (compliance), or an opportunity to build better software that respects its users first and foremost. I’m an optimist so I choose the latter, but this requires implementing fundamental engineering principles and tools. A great reference for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Cavoukian">Dr. Ann Cavoukian</a>’s seven principles for Privacy by Design, which are:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design#Proactive_not_reactive;_preventive_not_remedial">Proactive not reactive; preventive not remedial</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design#Privacy_as_the_default">Privacy as the default setting</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design#Privacy_embedded_into_design">Privacy embedded into design</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design#Full_functionality_%E2%80%93_positive-sum,_not_zero-sum">Full functionality—positive-sum, not zero-sum</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design#End-to-end_security_%E2%80%93_full_lifecycle_protection">End-to-end security—full lifecycle protection</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design#Visibility_and_transparency_%E2%80%93_keep_it_open">Visibility and transparency—keep it open</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design#Respect_for_user_privacy_%E2%80%93_keep_it_user-centric">Respect for user privacy—keep it user-centric</a></li></ol>



<p>Today, data privacy for most engineering teams is something tackled after software is shipped to production. It’s a little like application security a decade ago, where you’d complete implementation, and then security would happen after the fact by pen testing and fixing issues as they were identified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However over the last few years, AppSec has “<a href="https://www.credera.com/insights/shift-left-create-a-fast-secure-development-lifecycle">shifted left</a>” to be part of the SDLC. Well-built software is secure before it leaves the repo you were working in, and security is achieved through a change in engineering mindset and a suite of awesome tools for static code analysis, application security testing, and threat modeling that ensures the code you ship is as secure as it can be. Engineers are increasingly proud to have a security mindset and understand defensive design and zero trust principles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But again, today privacy is after-the-fact. For example, if you’re in an early-stage team, you iterate on an MVP until you find product market fit. That lean approach makes business sense, but as soon as you have traction—and customers—you’re collecting data. Because you didn’t plan for this part, you’re instantly exposing your users to risk and accumulating a form of data planning debt that’s nearly impossible to climb out of. The more successful your trajectory, the faster your growth, the more data you accumulate, and the more acute this problem becomes. You can’t go backwards and unpack the debt, so now you’re building unscalable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk">mechanical turks</a> to mitigate risk but unable to fix the underlying problem.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-problems-of-privacy">The problems of privacy</h2>



<p>Let me give some real-world technical problems this yields:</p>



<h3 id="h-real-world-problem-1-orphan-data-sets">Real world problem #1: Orphan data sets</h3>



<p>In large tech companies, “orphan data sets&#8221; refer to datasets that exist in their infrastructure that are still in use but there’s no clear understanding of <em>what</em> is in there, <em>where</em> the data comes from, and <em>how</em> it’s used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re all familiar with this story: you build your first product quickly, so perhaps your documentation isn’t perfect or your data model evolves organically. You find success and start growing, so more engineers join the team. Team hierarchy is pretty flat and can spin up a database and start working—awesome, we’re the essence of agile!</p>



<p>Then you’re concerned about system availability and scaling so you start to chunk things into a more elegant service-oriented architecture: different engineers pick pieces off as you add functionality to meet customer demand. Some of your early engineers leave the company, new ones join, the cycle repeats, and before long you have a platform of 500+ microservices and hundreds of databases without any consolidated annotations or metadata. You have no certainty in what serves which purpose and there’s lots of grey areas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/f76_b1Uw7z062Y2-ZepeGD6rKJwOrc5QCYCr_4ElIVq81wzaCghVDOLFSq5jC1MqugP15Np8Qqzdmvu8oNWU9GamTgBnc3iNkCnJr5AXS-5GfVGSUFjxZjeV9vpQPOYhM5C3QLqF" alt=""/></figure>



<p>How’s this solved today? A team of dedicated data engineers sift through these systems, starting from the dataset and working back forensically through the services layer to understand what data is being stored, what the services are doing, and what business function is being performed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because you haven’t changed your engineering practices—you’re still shipping code the way you were—it’s a Sisyphean problem. Your data engineers are constantly untangling systems to try and understand where data is and how to govern it safely on behalf of your users.</p>



<h3 id="h-real-world-problem-2-enforcing-a-user-s-rights">Real world problem #2: Enforcing a user&#8217;s rights</h3>



<p>In order to respect your users, you must respect their rights and, increasingly, these are backed by legal requirements, like with Europe’s GDPR, California’s CCPA, and Brazil’s LGPD.</p>



<p>These rights vary by location, but the basic principle is that when a user of your system wants to, they can access all the information you have about them, they can update it, or they can delete themselves completely. In addition to this, users have rights on how you are permitted to use their data. This creates requirements to be able to suppress an individual user&#8217;s data from being used in a specific process in your systems if they disagree with it.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GeOFWZG6PQoiLMRFlCHSBW5ri-z1LvjW1CCSP_IHN9fMNk821EZMpgXV_6EJ2wqOCNwF3gH8467bkCPr5pKFYeHuRp5XPjpPTVNGsvb9mT0GoSFuyidYFXxs0MRoKVljgNX95MIK" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Imagine you have a really elegant, service-oriented architecture of 400 services, each responsible for a distinct piece of business logic. If user A in your platform opts out of processing for 27 of the things you do, you need to be able to identify that individual, a single entity in your dataset, and enforce a constraint that may only apply to specific attributes of their entity recordset on a single process—just one services request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a 10,000 ft view, this is all possible if you’ve designed your architecture and data model to support this level of granularity and policy enforcement from the start within the SDLC. But that’s not what usually happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a production reality, you’re left with manual policy enforcement, new policy tables being joined to entity records at runtime in an ad hoc fashion to start to enforce specific constraints. It becomes a Rube Goldberg machine of your users submitting their consent preferences and checking boxes. It looks good in the UX at least, but in the backend it’s a bunch of unscalable manual processes, workflows and runbooks to update users&#8217; preferences and ensure they’re excluded from certain pipeline jobs. It also generates reports for legal teams to ensure that when a user has said “no” to something, their consent preference was enforced across your complex data plane. For a successful business, there’s the possibility that they’ll have to do this thousands, even millions of times.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-if-these-are-the-symptoms-what-s-the-cause">If these are the symptoms, what’s the cause?</h2>



<p>As I wrote earlier, privacy cannot be truly fixed with a bandaid after a system is built. The cause of data privacy failures happen upstream in the SDLC, long before most of us think of privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like application security, the source of problems and the locus of best prevention is where software is being designed, implemented, and tested. This is where instituting design decisions, implementation practices, and privacy devtools can mitigate privacy risks like the ones we so commonly see.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yqhyHCPeitowtKNq1Z5jeiP9vQzgOyF66-zDVV38ZeNJQPpnx36ZMTHii2ogt5qkQMTBQi--le-l9pH9ckIP_8STn4FpljCHM0WY4cqHTMoBHzhohBYVojX24Tn0dnaBgerfde45" alt=""/></figure>



<p>To put it simply: if privacy was part of the software development process, the example of trying to unpack orphan datasets would never materialize, because code merged in a privacy-centric SDLC will describes its purpose, the types of data it uses, and its data I/O so that you can easily observe across the data plane. You’d have a complete map of the data passing through every piece of code—because of steps like thorough annotation at the code level, you know explicitly the substance, source, and purpose of the data in your systems; every dataset has a home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An SDLC with privacy baked in results in a system that respects its users rights out of the box without bandaids or manual processes. The system identifies data flows clearly such that data discovery and mapping efforts are redundant; your product stack self-describes its data operations immediately upon deployment.</p>



<p>Treating privacy as an afterthought results in a vast waste of engineering resources in production-related privacy and data compliance operations, which could be obviated with better tooling in the CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="h-a-proposed-solution-to-data-privacy">A proposed solution to data privacy&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The core privacy problem of our age is that systems aren’t built to be respectful from the bottom-up. Some of the reasons for that are cultural, sure, but some are related to the tools at engineering teams’ disposal. Simply put, up to now they haven’t been fit for the task. I’ve been considering this problem at length, and have some ideas for how this problem could be solved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/R-GxDO-pvf1s5gh4ot-yJcNY9wrAfHFIFzJRHolN3SiwLO-GGbAkJISpZ9ggKGOCsX0ur7opOoaiwhVayYOWAj_ImYIwEO1yCScCFAxhIyPUiCvmA_UoV99Q9rKTv4W_aP4Vj_HQ" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 id="h-1-low-friction-privacy-dev-tools">1. Low-friction privacy dev tools</h3>



<p>The first step is ensuring engineers have a form of ‘privacy grammar’ or a shorthand, low-friction way to describe what their code does and what types of data it uses and make this part of their editor and CI process. Code comments and documentation are a good start, but a thorough tooling solution is both human and computer readable, integrated into both manual and automated workflows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When implementing a given functionality in their project with integrated tools, developers can easily describe the context of what their code is doing and on what types of data it’s acting.</p>



<p>Also, in the same way that security/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing">SAST</a> tools are now an accepted component of a well-built CI/CD process, tools that provide CI hooks that enable the privacy grammar and data classifications to be evaluated on each commit and MR, providing easy to apply nudges to developers on how to ensure their work is privacy respecting.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-automated-risk-evaluation">2. Automated risk evaluation</h3>



<p>At least for the foreseeable future, I don’t believe we can or should remove humans from the loop. However, the current process for most companies creates a lot of friction between engineers trying to ship code and the manual privacy review process, while also occupying valuable bandwidth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automation in the commit and merge phases can better groom high-risk and low-risk issues for human oversight and remove the need for engineers to completely async privacy review forms. Privacy risk evaluation can be an elegant part of the CI pipeline.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-a-global-personal-data-taxonomy">3. A global personal data taxonomy</h3>



<p>So much of privacy starts with understanding the data your software uses. One of the most common issues with healthy privacy is agreeing to a standard for the types of data in a system. Too often, data types are created by the teams that use them, leading to a hodgepodge of formats. Legal requirements in different geographies make standardization a challenge but this can be achieved by taking the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71670.html">ISO27701 PIMS</a> standards, specifically<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79573.html"> ISO/IEC DIS 19944-1</a>, and building a single view of personal data classification that can be modeled by every engineering team.</p>



<p>Using a single standard to classify data across a system, we can simplify interoperability of systems for privacy operations and users&#8217; rights requests as well as achieve uniform inter-system governance.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-a-privacy-policy-enforcement-engine">4. A privacy policy enforcement engine</h3>



<p>Today policy and governance enforcement requires extending an existing Role-Based Access Control (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">RBAC</a>) or Access Control List (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list">ACL</a>) type system to roll your own fine-grained governance solution, and it still typically acts at the abstract dataset or system level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A fine grained data policy model should be designed from day one to enforce data access at the individual field level for each entity based on policies managed at the entity level. This granularity is the only way to ensure that privacy rights can be truly enforceable. For this to be possible, however, it needs a scale of interoperability, so integration with a standard policy enforcement model like <a href="http://openpolicyagent.org">Open Policy Agent</a> is a key step.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-make-consent-part-of-validation-in-front-end-frameworks">5. Make consent part of validation in front-end frameworks</h3>



<p>Today consent is generally dealt with through cookie banners or individual flags set at runtime in a form flow. Consent can and should be a part of the validation module of all front-end frameworks. If we already know at runtime what data is being collected (because we’re validating for it) these same validators could be used to check for context. Tools like the fine-grained data policy model described above would permit any engineer to extend these validations to sensibly check for data type <em>and </em>consent.</p>



<p>We already use validation against field types to generate business logic checks for data type, structure, etc. This must be extended to ensure that field labels ascribe whether consent should be collected automatically and provide a central consent tracking service at application runtime so that user consent is unified throughout application usage. These steps make it harder for systems to accidentally fail to register consent choices or communicate a user&#8217;s rights.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-an-immutable-privacy-log">6. An immutable privacy log</h3>



<p>Every application should persist a hashed record of privacy related actions. Such a log would enable engineers to reliably track user rights and privacy activities through application and user lifecycle and demonstrate the decisions made in the privacy CI pipeline.</p>



<h3 id="h-trust-through-transparency"><strong>Trust through transparency</strong></h3>



<p>Transparency and privacy might seem strange bedfellows, but they&#8217;re actually closely linked. Think back to Dr. Cavoukian&#8217;s sixth principle of privacy by design: visibility and transparency. A commitment to building trustworthy systems applies to the very tools building those systems. Then every engineer, even without deep training, can do a better job of baking privacy into their code while also reducing friction between engineering and legal teams.</p>



<p>As software engineers, we build the systems that billions rely upon for their finances, safety, health and wellbeing. Our tools and processes must reflect the seriousness of our responsibility to respect users&#8217; data. A post-hoc approach to privacy is labor-intensive and risky. It is fundamentally reactive, unable to scale with the rapid growth of the systems that power our world.</p>



<p>By equipping engineers with the tools to implement privacy by design within the SDLC, we build better, safer and more respectful systems. On an operational level, we reduce the pain of fixing issues in production, enabling our teams to focus on innovation instead of scrambling to achieve after-the-fact compliance. On a cultural level, we deliver systems that genuinely earn users&#8217; trust, which are the only systems worth building in the 2020s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For years, engineers left AppSec as an afterthought. Today, it&#8217;s almost impossible to think of the typical SDLC without AppSec embedded into it. We can and must follow a parallel approach with privacy.</p>

<p><em>In this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the Stack Overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. Up now, #3 on our list: Python.</em></p>



<p>Python is consistently featured amongst the top <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved">most loved languages</a> in our Developer Survey. In 2020, 66.7% of respondents said they want to keep working with Python. Conceived in the late 80s, it’s one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers Rust (2010) and TypeScript (2012)—evidence that original designer Guido van Rossum got a lot right.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/z33enWLy5CoqqAblq9AMq0qCHJFQHI0BIV31SJ8-wpKjiHqFnwTPGYqvb3lA6hGWG48D62CjkZxKtOsR9cGAauw7ryjJLdVSZpXM0Gu3GgU2vlOWnm8g-Zol4QZ2fKjj1bjnkTs0" width="292" height="382">.</p>



<p><em>Most loved languages in 2020 in the </em><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved"><em>Developer Survey</em></a></p>



<p>Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python">quirky name</a>—in honor of the cult comedy show, <em>Monty Python</em>—belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. While it’s not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, it’s often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. This makes it ideally suited for applications like <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/">data science</a> and web development, and it’s used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to VFX and AI.</p>



<p>Some&nbsp; regard it as <a href="https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/">an ideal language for beginners</a>: many terms are expressed using English words rather than symbols, its strict rules about <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements">whitespace</a> mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in Python is often more <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comparison-of-python-with-other-programming-languages/">concise</a> than the equivalent in other languages.</p>

<p>Although Python has been around since the 1.0 release in 1991, its usage has ballooned in recent years. Indeed, as our former data scientist David Robinson <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/">noted</a>, since 2012, it has risen above the five other major languages (C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript and C#) in usage as estimated by the number of Stack Overflow question views per month. <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE’s 2021 index</a> ranks Python as third in popularity at 10.86%, rapidly gaining on C and Java (16.34% and 11.29% respectively). Today, 44 % of <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology">developers</a> and technologists around the world are using Python.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person—Dutch computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a>, who stepped down as Python’s “Benevolent Dictator For Life” in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/graphs/contributors">day</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-using-it"><strong>Who is using it?</strong></h2>



<p>Python is more or less ubiquitous—it would be faster to list industries that <em>don’t</em> use it in some form. While it’s not the language of choice for consumer applications like 3D games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use Python for tools and utilities. It is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes—for example, in the VFX field, nearly all of the major software packages (Maya, 3Ds Max, Houdini, Cinema 4D, Blender, and Nuke) have embedded Python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. It’s used more or less everywhere on Earth and, well, <a href="https://nasa.github.io/fprime/">even on Mars</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, if you’re reading this on a Mac, you already have Python <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/406244/will-macos-big-sur-remove-the-default-python-installation-for-good">installed</a> on your computer—just go to Terminal, type ‘python’, and away you go&#8230;</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-it-for"><strong>Who is it for?</strong></h2>



<h3 id="h-students"><strong>Students</strong></h3>



<p>The use of short English keywords instead of symbols makes Python particularly friendly for beginners. See the <a href="https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/python-java-a-side-by-side-comparison/">example</a> below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Python</td><td>Java</td></tr><tr><td># print the integers from 1 to 9<br>for i in <code>range(1,10):    </code><br>         <code>print i</code></td><td>// print the integers from 1 to 9<br>for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++){   <br>        System.out.println(i);<br>}</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Additionally, Python handles a lot of memory management <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11596371/how-does-python-memory-management-work">automatically</a>, so you’ll spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like C++.</p>



<p>It comes bundled with a free IDE (integrated development environment), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE">IDLE</a>, so you can get started quickly. In case you’re wondering, yes, IDLE is a reference to <em>Monty Python’s </em>Eric Idle—if you use Python you’re going to be bombarded with references to vintage British comedy.</p>



<h3 id="h-developers-who-prioritize-ease-of-programming-over-execution-speed"><strong>Developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed</strong></h3>



<p>While Python typically runs slower than other common languages like C++ or Java, it’s often much quicker to write—indeed, <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons/">some estimates suggest</a> a typical program in Python is three to five times shorter than its Java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the C++ version.</p>



<p>This is one of the reasons it’s often used as a “support language”—software developers rely on it for <a href="https://www.python.org/about/apps/">tasks</a> like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. For the same reason, it’s also used for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37084289/what-is-meant-by-prototyping-in-python">prototyping</a>—code can be “hacked together” quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language.</p>



<h3 id="h-developers-working-with-text-or-numbers"><strong>Developers working with text or numbers</strong></h3>



<p>Python’s <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/TextProcessingSolutions.html">powerful</a> String and List manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. And it’s a great tool for exploring data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact that it doesn’t need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running Python <a href="https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/#:~:text=A%20widely%20used%20way%20to,installation%2C%20and%20then%20hit%20Enter%20.">interactively</a>, you can intuitively manipulate data step-by-step, examining it at each stage.</p>



<p>Python’s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of ‘packages’, many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. These include the venerable <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> (mathematical functions and data analysis), <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> (for science), <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> (data visualization) and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> (data analysis), and more recently <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> and <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> (Machine Learning/AI), as well as <a href="https://pypi.org/">tens of thousands of others</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-web-developers"><strong>Web developers</strong></h3>



<p>Another key area of Python use is backend development. It has built-in support for common protocols like HTML, XML, and JSON, and frameworks like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, and <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Bottle</a> are used widely—for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/34d7cl/why_is_reddit_written_in_python_why_not_ruby_or/">Reddit</a>’s backend is Python. Python powers advanced content management, email <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/automate-email-with-python-1e755d9c6276">automation</a>, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-you-shouldn-t-learn-it"><strong>Why you shouldn&#8217;t learn it</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a lot to like about Python, but it’s not always the perfect tool for the job.</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, Python is an <em>interpreted </em>language, as opposed to a <em>compiled</em> language like C++. While that means there’s no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. So you’re probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster 60FPS first-person shooter in Python, but it’s perfect for situations like data manipulation where you’re likely to spend more time writing the program than running it.</p>



<p>Additionally, Python’s somewhat unusual syntax means that—if it’s your first language—not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. For example, the reduced reliance on<a href="https://lerner.co.il/2018/06/08/python-parentheses-primer/"> brackets and braces</a>, the use of English words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in Python may be <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Python">visually structured</a> in a very different way to the equivalent code in Java or C++.</p>



<p>However, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity.</p>



<h2 id="h-key-concepts"><strong>Key concepts</strong></h2>



<p>The core philosophies are summarized—in Pythonic fashion—in “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">The Zen Of Python</a>.” These include:</p>



<ul><li>“<a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/">Readability</a> counts</li><li>Simple is better than complex</li><li>There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it”</li></ul>

<p>On this episode we chat with Samuel Simões, the developer behind <a href="https://www.pokernow.club/">Poker Now</a>. Simões created the project so he an his friends could play poker during the pandemic lockdown. It became such a success, growing 100X, that he left his job building hospital management software and is now focused on trying to make a living as the sole author and architect of Poker Now.</p>



<h2 id="h-episode-notes">Episode Notes</h2>



<p>We discuss how Simões learned to code and the feature set that allowed Poker Now to differentiate itself in a crowded space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simões shares the tech stack he used to craft the first version of Poker Now, and how he rebuilt the service after it crashed under the weight of a massive wave of new users. During the peak of lockdown, his site went from an average of 100 concurrent users to more than 10,000 at a time.</p>



<p>Lastly, we chat about the allure of leaving a regular job behind to work on a passion project, and about the challenges of maintaining a service and earning a living as a solo developer.</p>



<p>Today we&#8217;re celebrating Divakar, who was awarded a lifeboat badge for answering the question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36522220/searching-a-sequence-in-a-numpy-array/36535397#36535397">Searching a sequence in a NumPy array.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Biometric authentication, which allows you to authenticate to a software system with a fingerprint or facial recognition, has been around for a while. In 2003, IBM Thinkpads had a fingerprint reader which let you log in to your computer. In 2013, Apple included a fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 5S, though there were other phones that had it first (hello Motorola Atrix!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But biometric authentication hasn’t been easily available to web applications until recently.</p>



<p>New web browser APIs&nbsp; make it easy to add strong biometric authentication to your web application.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-biometric-authentication">What is biometric authentication</h2>



<p>First, let’s talk about authentication in general. Biometric authentication is the general term for any authentication method which depends on a user’s physical attributes, such as a fingerprint, face, or voice.</p>



<p>There are three categories of authentication:</p>



<ul>
<li>Something you know, like a password</li>



<li>Something you have, like a device</li>



<li>Something you are, like a fingerprint</li>
</ul>



<p>Biometric authentication has significant advantages over other options:</p>



<ul>
<li>It is difficult to lose</li>



<li>It is hard to steal</li>



<li>It can’t be shared</li>



<li>You can’t forget it</li>
</ul>



<p>Letting your users authenticate using their biometrics has significant security and convenience advantages. According to “<a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4969&amp;context=sis_research">Biometric Authentication on iPhone and Android:</a></p>



<p><a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4969&amp;context=sis_research">Usability, Perceptions, and Influences on Adoption</a>,” a paper published in 2015, “&#8230;participants found Android face unlock and iPhone fingerprint unlock to be easy to use in a number of common usage scenarios.” By their very nature, biometric methods are more difficult for attackers to obtain than knowledge based authentication methods such as passwords.</p>



<p>You also don’t have to use biometric authentication alone. When combined with other authentication methods, such as a password or a magic link, biometric authentication can provide additional security without adding friction to the user experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-add-biometric-functionality-to-your-webapp">How to add biometric functionality to your webapp</h2>



<p>The easiest way to add biometric authentication to your web application is to use a standard called <a href="https://webauthn.guide">WebAuthn</a>. This is supported by every major browser (except IE, sorry IE users!) and links a friendly JavaScript API to a variety of hardware based authentication methods, including biometric options supported by desktop and mobile operating systems.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XPg5YauvJvgI8HeulyeSY0S8o207BAEXEEGj6ii89Uhe6mwoRelDks882LK44S0rtiApDa3cZ26QfnYhsEJ3mQD4dbUIT2h3QZ3fxdLyEYMdWdHuk1zX2eFl2c8F3rQ4JsxzmoZIQanmooF_xPDo4ZYB4by_OrhwNmmU77-VThw6Eb6impyp26ZOrslrLQ" alt="A chart from CanIUse.com illustrating which web browsers support the WebAuthn API. All modern browsers except IE and Opera Mini do so."/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Most web browsers support WebAuthn.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To add strong WebAuthn-based authentication, including biometric options, take the following high level steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Check to see if WebAuthn is supported using a JavaScript API to test the current browser.</li>



<li>Prompt the user to add a biometric authentication method</li>



<li>Associate the method with the account</li>



<li>At next login, identify the user in some fashion
<ul>
<li>Set a cookie when they add the method</li>



<li>Ask for their username</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>When you know who they are, prompt a WebAuthn login</li>



<li>The biometric authenticator (the phone or operating system) will issue an authentication challenge</li>



<li>The user answers it by providing their fingerprint or whatever biometric proof is needed</li>



<li>Your JavaScript receives and interprets a message from the browser</li>



<li>If the message indicates successful authentication, log the user in</li>
</ul>



<p>The actual code is pretty straightforward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To confirm that the browser supports WebAuthn, run this code:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>if (window.PublicKeyCredential) {
  // do your webauthn stuff
} else {
  // wah-wah, back to passwords for you
}
</code></pre>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, to add a biometric authentication method, you call this JavaScript method:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>navigator.credentials.create(options);</code></pre>



<p>To prompt a biometric login, use this JavaScript:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>navigator.credentials.get(options);</code></pre>



<p>The <code>options</code> object is critical and includes information about what type of credential you are asking for, a nonce that prevents replay attacks, and information about the requesting website. Full details are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">covered in the specification</a>, but we’ll also cover the <code>options</code> object in detail below.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-ve-got-standards">We’ve got standards&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It’s worth understanding the standards that allow a web application to leverage something like a user’s phone’s TouchID system for login. There are three main standards you should know about:</p>



<ul>
<li>WebAuthn, as already mentioned</li>



<li>CTAP2</li>



<li>FIDO2</li>
</ul>



<p>WebAuthn is also known as the Web Authentication API. This is the standard mentioned above, and as a web developer, the main one you’ll interact with. This API lets you communicate with browsers, such as Chrome or Safari, to request biometric and other means of authentication.</p>



<p>The second is <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20190130/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20190130.html">CTAP2</a>, which dictates how the browser interacts with what’s called an authenticator. An authenticator is the piece of hardware that authenticates a user with cryptographic certainty. In a biometric scenario, this might be an iOS device or Windows Hello. In general, as a web developer, you won’t be concerned with this standard, as the browser insulates you from it, but it is worthwhile to know it is in the mix.</p>



<p>If you are confused about how WebAuthn and CTAP2 interact, here’s a diagram. In this diagram, the user is the smiley face, the orange box is an authenticator like TouchID or Android Fingerprint Sensor, the white globe is the browser, and the blue box is a website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qR7pmji_I7Dv3m0RXRrtrz_rO9rXc0hqnf0kBm0q3Eeg4U98RTceWrfK7eZQB2UwHdzFjaPm1GzhlAmZMb2zUtvOdy_dYSaRwFyKi4rXj6H1cmvV3n0hlP8leHBj9y8frBPOyTfeuAzYa7HPDer4yeKvD6paOkGSP-nE_hcluwndMXVUet55Y5bwP4Rf3g" alt="A diagram showing the entities that take part in WebAuthn, with different entities being grouped. The WebAuthn protocol is concerned with the browser to website communication and the CTAP2 protocol addresses communication between the browser and the authenticator."/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The WebAuthn protocol is concerned with the browser to website communication and the CTAP2 protocol addresses communication between the browser and the authenticator.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, last but not least, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">FIDO2 is the umbrella standard</a>. FIDO2 includes both CTAP2 and WebAuthn. (CTAP1, the first version of CTAP, is supported for backwards compatibility.)</p>



<p>What is an authenticator?</p>



<p>Authenticators are what actually perform the biometric or other form of authentication. While this article focuses on biometric authentication, authenticators offer other methods to authenticate the user. At the heart of each authenticator is a way to generate and store public/private key pairs. The public key is shared with the web application and the private key is held securely by the authenticator.</p>



<p>An authenticator can be implemented in hardware or software, but software authenticators such as the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/webauthn/">one available in Chrome DevTools</a> are only recommended for testing, not for production use.</p>



<p>There are two main categories of authenticators, cross-platform and platform. Cross-platform authenticators can be used on more than one device. Platform authenticators are tied to a specific device, such as a phone. Most consumer-focused biometric authenticators are integrated into an operating system such as iOS, Android, or Windows. This means they are tied to a given device and are therefore platform authenticators.</p>



<p>The other important aspect of an authenticator is whether they test for user presence or user verification. User presence simply indicates that someone interacted with the authenticator (this interaction is called an “authorization gesture”) perhaps by clicking a button. Such a test of presence is useful if you are using an authenticator as part of a multi-factor authentication process.</p>



<p>User verification, on the other hand, offers assurances that the user who authenticated is actually who we think they are. This can be done by providing something they know, or, in the biometric case, using an attribute of the user such as the dimensions of their face. In most cases, you’ll be interested in user verification, which is what the common biometric authenticators provide.</p>



<h2 id="h-choices-choices">Choices, choices</h2>



<p>Due to the abstraction of the WebAuthn API, you can’t be certain the user is authenticating via a biometric. You can take certain steps to encourage it, but you can’t force it.</p>



<p>However, biometric authentication tied to popular operating systems are a quite prevalent form of WebAuthn-compatible hardware, so it is likely that if you encourage your users to set up WebAuthn logins, they’ll be using biometrics. You can also encourage this via the messaging on your website.</p>



<p>Even if they aren’t using biometrics, if you use WebAuthn, you can rest assured that they’ll be using a secure hardware solution for their authentication needs.</p>



<p>If the WebAuthn authentication succeeds, you won’t know what method was used. What you can control:</p>



<ul>
<li>If you’d prefer a cross-platform or platform authenticator to be used.</li>



<li>Asking for either user presence or user verification.</li>
</ul>



<p>Next, let’s dig in deeper to the flow of a user who is using WebAuthn-enabled biometric method to log in.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-ceremonies">What are “ceremonies”?</h2>



<p>If you read up about WebAuhn, you might hear the word “ceremony.” Ceremonies, in the context of WebAuthn, are prescribed interactions between software, hardware, and physical entities such as human beings or devices. You can think of ceremonies as network protocols extended to the physical world.</p>



<p>There are two types of ceremonies defined in WebAuthn, and both are required for biometric authentication to work with your web application.</p>



<h3 id="h-registration">Registration</h3>



<p>The first ceremony is registration, where the authenticator is, well, registered with your website. Likewise, your website is registered with the authenticator. The end result of a registration is a credential, which is used in later ceremonies.</p>



<p>To register an authenticator, use this code:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>navigator.credentials.create(options);</code></pre>



<p>As promised above, let’s dive into this in more detail. The <code>options</code> object looks like this:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>options =  {
  publicKey: {
	rp: { id: "cosmosclownstore.com",
      	name: "Cosmo’s Clown Store" },
	user: { id: "1234",
        	name: "krusty@example.com",
        	displayName: "Krusty The Clown" },
	challenge: "...",
	pubKeyCredParams: &#91; { type: "public-key", alg: -7 }],
            authenticatorSelection: {}
	//...
  }
}
</code></pre>



<p>&nbsp;Let’s look at this <code>options</code> object in more detail.</p>



<p>First, the <code>rp</code> field contains data about your web application. WebAuthn includes built-in security constraints such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Requiring all API calls to take place from a page served up by HTTPS.</li>



<li>Forcing the identifier of the website at registration to match the current hostname.</li>
</ul>



<p>When you are registering, you as the webapp developer can specify a broader domain if you’d like to be able to accept the new credential across multiple subdomains.</p>



<p>For example, if I register with an <code>rp.id</code> of cosmosclownstore.com, but later request a biometric login from a webapp hosted at app.cosmosclownstore.com, it will be allowed.</p>



<p>However, if I register with an <code>rp.id</code> of app.cosmosclownstore.com, then try to start a biometric authentication session from an app hosted at store.cosmosclownstore.com, it won’t.</p>



<p>Second, you have the <code>user</code> field, which contains information about this user. This ties the credential that is created on the authenticator to the account on the website. You may notice this implies that the user already has an account on the website, and that the new WebAuthn credentials are only another means of authentication, not the primary one. That is generally true, though there are authenticators that support something called “discoverable credentials,” which work around this limitation.</p>



<p>Third, there’s a <code>challenge</code> field, which is a nonce to prevent replay attacks. It’s a unique high-entropy string you as the web app developer must provide. This challenge will be returned in the response and you must verify they are the same.</p>



<p>Fourth, there’s the <code>pubKeyCredParams</code> field, which indicates what kind of public private key algorithm you are interested in supporting. The values of the objects in the array are defined in <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml">this IANA document</a>, but -7, indicating ECDSA w/ SHA-256, is guaranteed to be supported—it’s required by the specification.</p>



<p>Finally, there’s the <code>authenticatorSelection</code> field, which lets you indicate certain attributes of the authenticators for this ceremony. This includes the cross-platform/platform category as mentioned above.</p>



<p>After you build the <code>options</code> object and call <code>navigator.credentials.create(options);</code>, the user will be prompted by the authenticator to add a credential for your website. They’ll see information about you website from the <code>rp</code> object, as well as information about their account in the <code>user</code> object. If they choose to register, you’ll get back a response. Here’s an example response:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>{
  response: {
    clientDataJSON: { 
      type: “webauthn.create”,
      challenge: ... // should match initial challenge
      origin: ... //
    },
    attestationObject: {
      authData: {
        attestedCredentialData: {
          credentialId: ..., 
          credentialPublicKey: ...,
        }
      }, // other stuff about attestation 
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>



<p>&nbsp;The interesting parts are the <code>clientDataJSON</code> object, which has a couple of fields you should validate, including the <code>type</code>, <code>challenge</code>, and <code>origin</code>. Make sure these are as expected.</p>



<p>The confirmation of successful registration occurs in the <code>attestationObject.authData.attestedCredentialData</code> object, which includes the <code>credentialId</code> and the <code>credentialPublicKey</code>. These values must be associated with the user’s account; they’ll be used by the next ceremony—authentication—which will be discussed in detail below.</p>



<p>Just like a username/password credential, multiple users may register using biometric authentication on a given website. Below, the website for Cosmo’s Clown Store holds public keys from multiple users’ authenticators:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uPQQ4C0dvLmJtVSz8jqX4GYz8YNJbvgfBsmqmHCPQO8gCjYtilr1uSUJU8xMMZkn5EgVXE65HQgsVnnF7n5skClmPt-kyTAu1a--aGFzuZ1rxi9syckBMJNcX_3WqMskvQ94e3rS61bDxde4L4NhP_4JinmHSW8k4GttP5srcNW3HEBVhRIkqG-bPAO0JQ" alt="Three authenticators each have a private key that corresponds to a specific public key stored in the Cosmo’s Clown Store website."/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Each authenticator has a private key and a corresponding public key on a site where it has been registered.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But, crucially, each different website gets a different registration and credential (also called a “passkey”) on the same authenticator. Below, multiple websites hold a public key matching one of many private keys on a single user’s authenticator:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LupToLG03G5zknraOiwELXtdeh2YTsTWMDFiG0hBKRD7yugR6XVJPFh7HKEe810zAKIXOxjULsh_3i1C1Hw-dIcWfL4EdKyy32_bFQc5PZMEn_dhdriQUG_tGtyt3k2a3DYlfmWrdzRIXBySG_AjUXFe9OxbcFBVMecy5ipS_SH2WyBoWP_ULuRxoSQV4Q" alt="An authenticator can hold multiple private keys, each corresponding to a different website. In this picture, one authenticator has three private keys which match a single public key at one of three different websites."/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An authenticator can hold multiple private keys, each corresponding to a different website.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-authentication">Authentication</h3>



<p>Once your user has registered a biometric authentication method, they can now log in with their face or fingerprint. To prompt a biometric login, use this JavaScript:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>navigator.credentials.get(options);</code></pre>



<p>Again, the <code>options</code> object is critical. Here’s a sample <code>options</code> object:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>credentialId = // value pulled from data stored at registration 

options = {
  publicKey: {
	rpId: "cosmosclownstore.com",
	challenge: "...",
	userVerification: "preferred",
	allowCredentials: &#91;{ type: "public-key", id: credentialId }]
	//...
  }
}
</code></pre>



<p>Here, the <code>rpId</code> is the website identifier previously registered. The challenge again is a random string. <code>userVerification</code> specifies if we want the user to be verified or only test for user presence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <code>allowCredentials</code> field includes the list of allowable credentials for this login. The value of <code>credentialId</code> was stored by the server during the registration process. Therefore, you must have some other way of identifying the user before making the <code>navigator.credentials.get(options);</code> request so you can retrieve the correct credential id from the server side data store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Options include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Set a cookie when they register</li>



<li>Ask for their username</li>
</ul>



<p>After you build the <code>options</code> object and make the <code>get</code> request, you’ll be returned a response. That might look something like this:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>{
  authenticatorData: {
	rpIdHash : ..., // hash of the requesting party Id
	flags : ..., // bit array including authentication results
	// other info
  },
  clientDataJSON: {
	type: "webauthn.get",
	challenge: ... // should match initial challenge
  }
}
</code></pre>



<p>&nbsp;Similarly to the registration ceremony, verify the values, such as the <code>challenge</code> and the <code>type</code>, in the <code>clientDataJSON</code> object to make sure they are what you expect.</p>



<p>In addition, examine the <code>authenticatorData.rpIdHash</code> to make sure that the value matches a SHA256 hash of the <code>rpId</code> presented in the request. This value is the hashed <code>rpId</code> that the browser saw. If it is different than what the webapp presented, you may have a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>



<p>Finally, the <code>authenticatorData.flags</code> field is a bit field which contains the results of the authentication. Bit 0 is set if the user was present, and bit 2 is set if the user was verified.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-beyond-the-ceremonies">Beyond the ceremonies</h2>



<p>Integrating biometric authentication into your webapp without extensive integration work is pretty cool, especially since almost everyone with a smart phone now has such an authenticator in their pocket.</p>



<p>However, there’s other work to do to build a full biometric login system. Additional items to be aware of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Unless you do certain things beyond the specification (“passkeys” managed by a central server), each credential is tied to a specific authenticator. This means that while biometric authentication is great as an alternative authentication method, it shouldn’t be the only one, unless you have a robust account recovery process. Otherwise a lost phone will mean an abandoned account.</li>



<li>While the JavaScript code to register and log a user in is pretty straightforward, there’s some work to determine if the user has a valid biometric authenticator, store the credentials safely after registration, and prompt the user to log in using their biometric credentials. This scaffolding is required, but I haven’t seen libraries which help with it; be prepared to write your own logic.</li>



<li>You can use WebAuthn as a second part of an MFA process, as mentioned above. It is remarkably phishing resistant, since you must have possession of the authenticator to complete the authentication ceremony.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SPONSORED BY SAP</h2>



<p>These days, developers are under pressure to meet heightened productivity demands. Many tech experts are used to receiving requests from other departments—sales, marketing, finance—asking if it would be possible to build a new tool or create an integration. “Sorry to bother you, but we were wondering if you might be able to build us X for Y.” Business requirements are accelerating demand for cloud solutions and limited development resources are inhibiting digitalization.</p>



<p>Aside from adding headcount, there is not a straightforward way to add lots of highly trained coders to your organization. There is, however, another path to take. What we need are tools that can enable developers to work more efficiently and non-developers to produce their own technical solutions—and alleviate some of the pressures on IT as a result.</p>



<p>Developers with a background in computer science and engineering will continue to push innovation forward with code-first approaches as technology evolves. However, low-code/no-code (LCNC) tools can give them efficiency advantages while additionally opening doors for more non-technical employees to be a part of the development process, leading to increased collaboration.</p>



<p>Developer skills are powerful. But they are also scarce. If companies want to continue to improve efficiency, LCNC tools are a must. For context, consider a common environment that pro-devs are working in: Data and processes are fragmented, legacy systems have long backlogs, and they cannot leverage emerging technologies and stay agile without risk. LCNC tools that leverage a single cloud foundation enable developers to accelerate the pace of innovation that they can deliver.</p>



<p>Furthermore, LCNC makes software development more accessible to people with less, or even no, technical skills. Platforms that offer LCNC development make collaboration between the pro-devs and non-devs possible as “fusion teams.”</p>



<p>SAP has a long history of customer projects that combine technical developers and business experts, especially for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> implementations.&nbsp;We have witnessed the value of collaboration:&nbsp;developers gain greater knowledge and direct access to business domain knowledge, while the business users gain a better understanding of the underlying technology aspects. This accelerates the requirements definition, testing, and troubleshooting phases.</p>



<p>The same kind of value and even more can be realized with business experts becoming citizen developers and collaborating with professional developers to build solutions. However, getting LCNC right means being mindful about what works and what does not – here are some key takeaways we have learned about LCNC and how to strike the right balance on fast-paced development teams that include business users.</p>



<h2 id="h-tips-for-building-with-low-code-no-code-tools"><strong>Tips for building with low-code/no-code tools</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/research-increased-use-of-low-code-no-code-platforms-poses-no-threat-to-developers/">According to a TechRepublic survey</a>, respondents expect LCNC platforms to improve their productivity (15%), reduce application development time (14%), and automate manual processes (12%). Technical and non-technical teams can work together to make these expectations a reality by implementing some of the following suggestions.</p>



<h3 id="h-create-a-group-of-citizen-developers"><strong>Create a group of citizen developers</strong></h3>



<p>We see citizen developers as people who do not code for a living—product managers, process experts, business analysts, designers, and MBA program graduates. These are all smart people from all backgrounds with diverse perspectives to solve problems and uncover pathways to solutions. Plus, these individuals may be solving their own problems, so they have a greater connection to the solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because non-technical teammates may be new to development ecosystems, they will need training to understand the possibilities and how to best implement their latest ideas. Through learning, inexperienced builders gain the confidence to step into a new field, opening the door for collaboration that only benefits the organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One step that companies can take is to create clear incentives for adopting LCNC solutions. That means being clear about the benefits and outcomes of LCNC. Why should citizen developers be inspired to keep learning and trying out new tools? What are some potential outcomes that make life better at work?</p>



<p>Kickstarting this level of buy-in is rooted in raising awareness of LCNC opportunities throughout the organization. For companies to leverage LCNC, they must ensure the availability of learning and development resources to their staff—opening the door for a new level of problem solving.</p>



<h3 id="h-focus-on-key-lcnc-projects-that-make-strategic-sense"><strong>Focus on key LCNC projects that make strategic sense</strong></h3>



<p>Business teams are usually motivated to take on LCNC for several reasons. They want to offer new products and solutions and take ideas to market faster. They want to create stronger, more connected, customized experiences for customers. And they feel the pain of expending time on manually inputting the same information repeatedly and other inefficient, analog activities.</p>



<p>Business users with expertise in the activity they want to digitalize and a willingness to apply themselves to learn visual programming can create straightforward use cases for their day-to-day work, regardless of their line of business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When getting started, business users may or may not already have an exact use case in mind for automation or application development. To find ideas, they can explore known pain-points in daily business activities and industry-specific requirements, or they could start in the pre-built content marketplace and see some commonly-used solutions. Once they have a list of ideas, there should be a strategic prioritization process based on predicted business impact.</p>



<p>Another way for business users to get started is to participate in proof-of-concept (POC) prototype development projects for transformation of a more complex process or activity that has already been assigned a high strategic priority by the IT department. POC prototypes can be an excellent way for business users such as designers to share their vision of the end-product with a developer colleague or project team to validate requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyday issues and requests are some of the best candidates for LCNC solutions. Business professionals should be empowered to build needed extensions and applications. With the shortage of IT resources and professional developers, LCNC tools can allow anyone to improve their own workflows and automate manual work as well as maximize speed, agility, and innovation when producing working prototypes that solve business problems.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-expand-access-to-new-roles-and-opportunities-through-lcnc-learning-resources"><strong>Expand access to new roles and opportunities through LCNC learning resources</strong></h3>



<p>While LCNC tools are more accessible than programming languages, learning is required before getting started—especially for business users who are new to software development—or else the first automations and applications that are built will be sloppy, unscalable, and even create IT risks.</p>



<p>LCNC courses open the door for inexperienced users to gain a basic understanding before diving in. They cover conceptual things like identifying use cases and how to prioritize where to start. They include insight into software structure, design, and logic flows as well as planning for the user experience before the building work even begins. And then of course a thorough hands-on review of the capabilities while building simple training cases ensures the product knowledge is gained through practical experience.</p>



<p>As a result, learning tools and courses are becoming increasingly leveraged by individuals interested in jumping into LCNC technology. LCNC learners make up around 19% of all people making use of the <a href="https://learning.sap.com/?source=blogs-stackoverflow-prdteng-&amp;utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=prdteng">free SAP’s Learning site</a> for upskilling on SAP solutions. These learning programs are expanding access to LCNC tools, opening the door for new roles and opportunities that lead to a more diverse and inclusive developer community.</p>



<p>Through SAP’s free offerings, SAP provides a <a href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/utilize-sap-build-for-low-code-no-code-applications-and-automations-for-citizen-developers?source=blogs-stackoverflow-prdteng&amp;utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=prdteng">LCNC Learning Journey</a> for everyone. Regardless of background, users can learn LCNC in only 12 hours. By providing courses that begin with teaching small, familiar apps, learners grasp the basic concepts before they move into trainings for building apps for an enterprise context.</p>



<p>To provide an example of the learning process, SAP’s LCNC Learning Journey covers everything learners need to know to start building with SAP’s LCNC toolset. This begins with a fundamentals course for citizen developers that covers the elements of business process automation and application development. The training then covers building enterprise-grade business apps without background knowledge of software development, IT governance, or software lifecycle management. At the end of this learning journey, there is an option to take an exam for the “SAP Certified Citizen Developer Associate,” a milestone toward becoming a knowledgeable builder with our low-code/no-code tools.</p>



<p>Through LCNC training and certifications, participants feel empowered to bring their learnings back to the workplace with practical use-cases and customer success stories. The more that organizations can incorporate a culture of learning across the workplace, the more motivated employees will be to take on new and exciting challenges. Appathons, for example, create a fun and competitive environment for learning and have been extraordinarily successful in launching LCNC tools.</p>



<h2 id="h-implementing-lcnc-through-creative-learning-opportunities"><strong>Implementing LCNC through creative learning opportunities</strong></h2>



<p>LCNC is what lets business experts validate their ideas before asking engineers to commit valuable people power to design and deploy a production-ready solution. LCNC also empowers business professionals to create a production-ready application themselves. Sometimes that is as simple as approving what has been built. Other times the goal is to ensure that what has been built can scale, integrate, and work well with security, compliance, and reliability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building the right LCNC workflows starts from learning about what the tools can do. Appathons are an excellent method for citizens to learn the basics of app development, build their first apps, and share their experiences.</p>



<p>Recently, SAP hosted a hackathon where teams tried to create a new app or feature over the course of two weeks. One of the teams crafted a new option for recycling or reusing batteries from the tools they sell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From my side, I come from the operations background, so as you can imagine, development is not my strongest point and having something like low-code no-code really makes things easier for any sort of application,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guipaiva/?locale=en_US"><strong>Guilherme Paiva</strong></a>, a senior DevOps engineer. Using AppyGyver, the team was able to sketch a design in minutes and build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in hours. “If I want to create some internal application, it is easy, and the experience was good.”</p>



<p>“I think one thing we can take away from the great advantages of low-code no-code is that rapid build and that rapid build-fail-build-fail-success, that is what I really enjoyed watching,” said Glenn Roberts, Chief Engineer. Internally, he is accustomed to long roadmaps for building and deploying a product. “And before we realized it was a two-week challenge, the bulk of the work happened in the first week because of work commitments and remoteness. If you think about it, we knocked this out of the park in half the time.”</p>



<p>“The app development was done in less than 16 hours I would say. While I was attending meetings, I was learning, and the learning element (AppGyver tutorials) was very good,” says Bedi. “Sometimes, I felt I could just code it. That was the most challenging part for me coming from the development background. Otherwise, it was amazing, and as I said, it was done in under 16 hours.”</p>



<p>LCNC tools are increasing in demand as companies struggle to close an ever-widening skills gap. While LCNC tools make coding accessible to people without a traditional developer background, LCNC’s full potential cannot be reached without proper training and development. Through our <a href="https://learning.sap.com/?source=blogs-stackoverflow-prdteng-&amp;utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=prdteng">SAP Learning offerings</a>, we hope to make LCNC tools a worthwhile investment for employees, students, and future developers, diversifying the IT talent pool and increasing innovation.</p>

<p>If you’re a developer, your skills are transferable across borders. If you’ve ever thought about relocating to Japan from outside of the country, you’ll find that there are some awesome job opportunities there. Finding a great opportunity, however, can be a needle in a haystack. It’s this pain point that led Eric Turner to create <a href="https://japan-dev.com/">Japan Dev</a>, a job board that curates handpicked tech jobs in Japan.</p>



<p>Eric, himself, is American—a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh. When he relocated to Japan, he needed to find a job, apartment, and all of the other things that come with moving to a new country. In today’s podcast, he talks to Matt about the experiences that led him to co-founding Japan Dev.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>Eric explains that great jobs are available for developers in Japan, but it can be tough to find these opportunities.</p>



<p>We talk about interesting startups that are gaining traction in the Japanese tech sector (like <a href="https://visual-alpha.com/en">Visual Alpha</a>, <a href="https://www.treasuredata.com/">Treasure Data</a>, and <a href="https://exawizards.com/en/">Exawizards</a>, to name a few examples of companies on the Japan Dev platform).</p>



<p>Matt is impressed to learn Japan Dev generates an estimated $60,000/month in revenue, on average.</p>



<p>Eric reflects on starting Japan Dev as a side project while he was employed full-time as an engineer.</p>



<p>Eric elaborates on why he doesn’t think venture capital is a good fit for Japan Dev.</p>



<p>Night owls unite! Eric says that his most productive hours are between midnight to 4AM.</p>

<p>A lot of people in tech lost their jobs this week—and in 2022, generally. Twitter is one situation that many of us are watching closely. One theory is that companies are beginning to prioritize lean teams and sustainable growth over hypergrowth. Are we looking at a turning point for how tech gets built?</p>



<p>On today’s podcast, Ben, Matt, and Cassidy reflect on job losses in tech, repojacking on GitHub, the ethics of generative AI, and what it would take to make us switch browsers.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>The team questions whether <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33379578">a print out of 60-90 days worth of code</a> is the right benchmark for whether to lay someone off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ben gives our podcast&nbsp; listeners a heads up to reports of repo jacking on GitHub (who <a href="https://checkmarx.com/blog/attacking-the-software-supply-chain-with-a-simple-rename/">got ahead of the issue quickly</a>).</p>



<p>We reflect on whether or not we’re okay with generative AI—and question tradeoffs between copyright and the ability for more people to create stuff.</p>



<p>Ben discusses how his internet browser might be becoming his <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/03/two-heads-are-better-than-one-what-second-brains-say-about-how-developers-work/">second brain</a>.</p>



<p>Matt and Cassidy get props from Ben for their rising popularity on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StackOverflowOfficial">Stack Overflow’s YouTube channel</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2022 has flown by. Before we bid <em>adieu</em> to another year we think it’s important  to take a moment to acknowledge and celebrate the final cohort of sites on the Stack Exchange network who have turned ten this year. Whether you’re into <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, quadcopters, surname origins, Multi Site Manager (MSM), or international relations—we have five sites hitting milestones that hope you’ll join them in celebration. </p>



<h3 id="h-genealogy-family-history"><a href="https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/">Genealogy &amp; Family History&nbsp;</a></h3>



<p>We’re a community made up of enthusiasts and experts who are interested in building their skills and sharing their knowledge on issues surrounding genealogy, family history, and microhistory. We tackle everything from the practical: <a href="https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/questions/31/when-documenting-location-should-current-or-historical-place-names-be-used">When documenting location, should current or historical place names be used?</a> to the personal: <a href="https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/questions/2442/how-do-i-encourage-older-folk-to-provide-information">How do I encourage older folk to provide information?</a> If you are looking for information or a place to share your insights on <a href="https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dna">DNA</a>, <a href="https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/palaeography">palaeography</a>, or <a href="https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/census-records">census records</a>, there’s a place for you here.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-robotics"><a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/">Robotics</a>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>For some, robotics may conjure images of Rosey from the Jetsons or Robby from Forbidden Planet. However, our community is not about sci-fi robots. We’re a place for professional robotic engineers, hobbyists, researchers, and students to share their knowledge and learn from one another. We’re where you would go to find out about <a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/679/why-are-mars-rovers-so-slow">why Mars rovers have those weird wheels</a> or to get help <a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/167/what-are-good-strategies-for-tuning-pid-loops">tuning your PID loops</a>. If you need to determine <a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/8426/denavit-hartenberg-parameters-3dof-articulated-manipulator">DH parameters </a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/3110/ros-best-practices">debug your ROS nodes</a>, we’ve got you covered. We’re also the place to learn or share your knowledge on everything from <a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mobile-robot">mobile robots</a> to <a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino">arduino</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-expressionengine-answers"><a href="https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/">ExpressionEngine® Answers</a>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Ten years ago, ExpressionEngine developers came together to vote for a Stack Exchange site where we could ask and answer technical questions related to the software we used every day on our projects. The goal was to create a place where we could support each other and to build a public archive of solutions to common and not so common problems. Since the launch of the ExpressionEngine Stack Exchange site, over 12,000 questions have been asked and the top question, related to <a href="https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/questions/45/migrating-between-development-staging-and-production-for-a-pre-existing-express">migrating between environments</a>, has been viewed over 9,000 times. The community curates answers to everything from <a href="https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/questions/162/list-of-resources-for-ee-developers-and-users">lists of resources for Expression Engine developers and users</a> and <a href="https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-is-parse-order-and-how-does-it-affect-how-my-template-is-coded-rendered">what parse order is</a>. Kudos to everyone who helped bring this website to fruition!</p>



<h3 id="h-politics"><a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/">Politics&nbsp;</a></h3>



<p>Politics Stack Exchange can answer everything from <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/1237/what-governmental-power-does-the-monarch-hold-in-great-britain-in-practice">What are the powers of the British Monarch</a> to <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/30223/why-doesn-t-the-irs-just-send-me-a-bill-for-the-taxes-i-owe-based-on-the-info-th">why doesn&#8217;t the IRS make taxes simple?</a> However, Politics Stack Exchange isn&#8217;t a place to promote political opinions; we try to keep the site unbiased and interesting for all. Our site is a place to get serious answers about political questions. We handle simple topics like <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/19719/what-is-a-hung-parliament">What is a Hung Parliament?</a>, as well as highly contentious topics like <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/18620/why-are-so-many-americans-against-obamacare">Why are so many Americans against Obamacare?</a>&nbsp; We can provide you with answers to the most <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/27426/could-ecuador-get-julian-assange-out-of-the-uk-by-giving-him-some-mail-to-delive">specific and niche questions</a> and you might learn a little something about <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/27426/could-ecuador-get-julian-assange-out-of-the-uk-by-giving-him-some-mail-to-delive/27463#27463">international law</a> in the process. Come exercise your internet right to vote and explore the often confusing and tangled web of politics.</p>



<h3 id="h-anime-manga"><a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/">Anime &amp; Manga</a>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We&#8217;re anime and manga; unlike some of the rest of our sister sites we tend <a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/836/do-people-in-the-anime-or-manga-actually-eat-pokemon">not to take ourselves too seriously</a> and are just here to have fun and enjoy ourselves. Come to our site to experience your own epic adventure as guided by our community. We have a lot of questions already—definitely over 9000. You’ll get started with the foundations of <a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3408/what-is-the-first-ever-produced-anime-and-manga">anime and manga</a> and get to know a bit more about what makes the cast of characters you’ll encounter so <a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4748/why-do-anime-manga-characters-have-big-eyes">vibrant</a> and <a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2872/why-do-many-characters-tend-to-have-crazy-hair-colors-and-styles">diverse</a>.

<p>Once again congratulations to these five communities on their ten year anniversaries. This is our final Stack Exchange Network anniversary celebration of 2022. We look forward to celebrating more milestones next year. I think a little site called Stack Overflow is turning fifteen in 2023. Let the merriment continue.</p>

<h2>SPONSORED BY HEDERA HASHGRAPH</h2>



<iframe loading="lazy" height="200px" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless="" src="https://player.simplecast.com/86c50bfd-4ec5-49ba-b464-887123e3a2a9?dark=false"></iframe>



<p>When most people talk about Web3 or cryptocurrencies and related technologies, they usually mean blockchains. But blockchain is only the first generation of distributed ledger technology (DLT). As with any new technology, once people see how it works, new generations come along rapidly to address the faults in the previous ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, Ben and Ryan chat with Matt Woodward, head of developer relations at <a href="https://swirldslabs.com/">Swirlds Labs</a>. Swirlds Labs created the Hedera ecosystem, a DLT built on a hashgraph, not a blockchain. We chat about what the difference is between a blockchain and a hashgraph, Hedera’s focus on environmental sustainability, and why the Web3 version of “Hello, World!” takes a little more effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-show-notes">Show notes</h2>



<p>Hedera’s hashgraph is a third-generation DLT: it’s an open-source consensus algorithm and a data structure that uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">direct acyclic graph</a> and two novel inventions, the gossip about gossip protocol and virtual voting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where Bitcoin can only handle between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem">three and seven transactions per second</a>, a hashgraph can support upwards of 10,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s been <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/08/fact-sheet-climate-and-energy-implications-of-crypto-assets-in-the-united-states/">a lot of talk about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies</a>. Woodward says that a single Bitcoin transaction uses 1000kW-hours—the equivalent of driving a Tesla Model S 5,500 km—while Hedera uses just 0.00017kWh per transaction, about 5.8 million times less.</p>



<p>Congrats to the winner of a Stellar Question badge, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/49202/g-revolution">g.revolution</a>, for their question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/980601/what-is-an-anti-pattern">What is an anti-pattern?</a> 100 users saved it for later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Phillip Shoemaker thinks we’re at a critical turning point for the web, with identity and privacy being core, foundational priorities. Imagine an internet where it&#8217;s easy to provide just the data you want or need to exchange. Envision being able to protect your anonymity, no questions asked.</p>



<p>Shoemaker isn’t exactly new to the topic of turning points for the web. He grew up in Cupertino, around the corner from Apple headquarters. His dad was an engineer at IBM. He eventually ended up working for Apple in 2009 where he helped the company navigate one of the biggest turning points in internet history — the launch of the App Store</p>



<p>In today’s podcast episode, we reflect on Shoemaker’s career experiences and discuss why he’s now focused on decentralized networks of trust.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>Shoemaker spent his childhood in Silicon Valley and learned Assembly when he was just 16 years old.</p>



<p>In his early 20s, he applied to work at Apple and was continually rejected. So he went to work for seven startups instead.</p>



<p>Finally, in 2009, Shoemaker ended up at Apple overseeing the review process for the App Store.</p>



<p>After seven years at Apple, Phillip became interested in cryptocurrency after discovering his personal information on the dark web.</p>



<p>His interest grew in the topic of self sovereign identities, which led him to become CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.identity.com/">Identity.com</a>.</p>



<p>Phillip and Ben reflect on the utility of Web3 in gaming.</p>



<p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/benpopper">Ben</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pbsIdentity">Phillip</a>.<br><br>Thank you to lifeboat badge winner <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/9435624/marchingband">Marchingband</a> for their answer to the question about running C or C++ code from Node.js in an efficient way.</p>

<p>At some point, a lot of developers think about becoming entrepreneurs. Some end up taking the jump. So what happens when it turns out that nobody wants your product?</p>



<p>Cara Borenstein, co-founder at Stashpad, ended up in this exact situation. After a two year stint as a software engineer at Twilio, she saw an opportunity to create a notepad for developers to stay on top of context switching and manage knowledge-related tasks. V. 1 was a wiki that didn’t quite catch on.</p>



<p>Embracing this reality, Borenstein and her team decided to dig deeper by talking with target customers. That process catalyzed a transformation of the core product into something people need and love, a second brain for busy developers that helps them stay focused and retain those stray thoughts that can add up to something big later on.</p>



<p>In today’s podcast, Matt, Ceora, and Cassidy reflect on Cara’s founder journey.</p>



<p><strong>Episode Notes:</strong></p>



<p>Cara shares her experiences living in New York and San Francisco— and why she and her co-founder ultimately located <a href="https://www.stashpad.com/">Stashpad</a> in North Carolina.</p>



<p>She elaborates on the exact steps that she took to pivot her startup following limited initial interest in V1 of the product.</p>



<p>Despite being in the Bay Area and working at Twilio, she was struggling to meet people because her full brain power was going to her products.</p>



<p>She shares what it was like for her and her co-founder to hire Stashpad’s first employees.</p>



<p>The group discusses Stashpad’s pathway to monetization in the context of developers wanting free tools.</p>

<p>Assertion Roulette doesn&#8217;t mean that multiple assertions are bad.</p>



<p>When I coach teams or individual developers in test-driven development (TDD) or unit testing, I frequently encounter a particular notion: <em>Multiple assertions are bad. A test must have only one assertion.</em></p>



<p>That idea is rarely helpful.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s examine a realistic code example and subsequently try to understand the origins of the notion.</p>



<h2 id="h-outside-in-tdd">Outside-in TDD</h2>



<p>Consider a REST API that enables you to make and cancel restaurant reservations. First, an HTTP <code>POST</code> request makes a reservation:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>POST /restaurants/1/reservations?sig=epi301tdlc57d0HwLCz&#91;...] HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "at": "2023-09-22 18:47",
  "name": "Teri Bell",
  "email": "terrible@example.org",
  "quantity": 1
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Location: /restaurants/1/reservations/971167d4c79441b78fe70cc702&#91;...]
{
  "id": "971167d4c79441b78fe70cc702d3e1f6",
  "at": "2023-09-22T18:47:00.0000000",
  "email": "terrible@example.org",
  "name": "Teri Bell",
  "quantity": 1
}
</code></pre>



<p>Notice that in <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">proper REST</a> fashion, the response returns the location of the created reservation in the <code>Location</code> header.</p>



<p>If you change your mind, you can cancel the reservation with a <code>DELETE</code> request:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>DELETE /restaurants/1/reservations/971167d4c79441b78fe70cc702&#91;...] HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</code></pre>



<p>Imagine that this is the desired interaction. Using <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/outside-in-tdd">outside-in TDD</a> you write the following test:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>&#91;Theory]
&#91;InlineData(884, 18, 47, "c@example.net", "Nick Klimenko", 2)]
&#91;InlineData(902, 18, 50, "emot@example.gov", "Emma Otting", 5)]
public async Task DeleteReservation(
    int days, int hours, int minutes,
    string email, string name, int quantity)
{
    using var api = new LegacyApi();
    var at = DateTime.Today.AddDays(days).At(hours, minutes)
        .ToIso8601DateTimeString();
    var dto = Create.ReservationDto(at, email, name, quantity);
    var postResp = await api.PostReservation(dto);
    Uri address = FindReservationAddress(postResp);
 
    var deleteResp = await api.CreateClient().DeleteAsync(address);
 
    Assert.True(
        deleteResp.IsSuccessStatusCode,
        $"Actual status code: {deleteResp.StatusCode}.");
}
</code></pre>



<p>This example is in C# using <a href="https://xunit.net/">xUnit.net</a> because we need <em>some</em> language and framework to show realistic code. The point of the article, however, applies across languages and frameworks. The code examples in this article are based on the sample code base that accompanies my book <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2021/06/14/new-book-code-that-fits-in-your-head"><em>Code That Fits in Your Head</em></a>.</p>



<p>In order to pass this test, you can implement the server-side code like this:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>&#91;HttpDelete("restaurants/{restaurantId}/reservations/{id}")]
public void Delete(int restaurantId, string id)
{
}
</code></pre>



<p>While clearly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)">no-op</a>, this implementation passes all tests. The newly-written test asserts that the HTTP response returns a status code in the <code>200</code> (success) range. This is part of the API&#8217;s REST protocol, so this response is important. You want to keep this assertion around as a regression test. If the API ever begins to return a status code in the <code>400</code> or <code>500</code> range, it would be a breaking change.</p>



<p>So far, so good. TDD is an incremental process. One test doesn&#8217;t drive a full feature.</p>



<p>Since all tests are passing, you can <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/06/use-git-tactically/">commit the changes to source control and proceed to the next iteration</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-strengthening-the-postconditions">Strengthening the postconditions</h2>



<p>You should be able to check that the resource is truly gone by making a <code>GET</code> request:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>GET /restaurants/1/reservations/971167d4c79441b78fe70cc702&#91;...] HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found</code></pre>



<p>This, however, is not the behavior of the current implementation of <code>Delete</code>, which does nothing. It seems that you&#8217;re going to need another test.</p>



<p>Or do you?</p>



<p>One option is to <em>copy</em> the existing test and change <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/06/24/a-heuristic-for-formatting-code-according-to-the-aaa-pattern">the assertion phase</a> to perform the above <code>GET</code> request to check that the response status is <code>404</code>:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>&#91;Theory]
&#91;InlineData(884, 18, 47, "c@example.net", "Nick Klimenko", 2)]
&#91;InlineData(902, 18, 50, "emot@example.gov", "Emma Otting", 5)]
public async Task DeleteReservationActuallyDeletes(
    int days, int hours, int minutes,
    string email, string name, int quantity)
{
    using var api = new LegacyApi();
    var at = DateTime.Today.AddDays(days).At(hours, minutes)
        .ToIso8601DateTimeString();
    var dto = Create.ReservationDto(at, email, name, quantity);
    var postResp = await api.PostReservation(dto);
    Uri address = FindReservationAddress(postResp);
 
    var deleteResp = await api.CreateClient().DeleteAsync(address);
 
    var getResp = await api.CreateClient().GetAsync(address);
    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.NotFound, getResp.StatusCode);
}
</code></pre>



<p>This does, indeed, prompt you to properly implement the server-side <code>Delete</code> method.</p>



<p>Is this, however, a good idea? Is the test code easy to maintain?</p>



<p>Test code is code too, and you have to maintain it. Copy and paste is problematic in test code for the same reasons that it can be a problem in production code. If you later have to change something, you have to identify all the places that you have to edit. It&#8217;s easy to miss one, which can lead to bugs. This is true for test code as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-one-action-more-assertions">One action, more assertions</h2>



<p>Instead of copy-and-pasting the first test, why not instead <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2021/12/13/backwards-compatibility-as-a-profunctor">strengthen the postconditions of the first test case</a>?</p>



<p>Just add the new assertion after the first assertion:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>&#91;Theory]
&#91;InlineData(884, 18, 47, "c@example.net", "Nick Klimenko", 2)]
&#91;InlineData(902, 18, 50, "emot@example.gov", "Emma Otting", 5)]
public async Task DeleteReservation(
    int days, int hours, int minutes,
    string email, string name, int quantity)
{
    using var api = new LegacyApi();
    var at = DateTime.Today.AddDays(days).At(hours, minutes)
        .ToIso8601DateTimeString();
    var dto = Create.ReservationDto(at, email, name, quantity);
    var postResp = await api.PostReservation(dto);
    Uri address = FindReservationAddress(postResp);
 
    var deleteResp = await api.CreateClient().DeleteAsync(address);
 
    Assert.True(
        deleteResp.IsSuccessStatusCode,
        $"Actual status code: {deleteResp.StatusCode}.");
    var getResp = await api.CreateClient().GetAsync(address);
    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.NotFound, getResp.StatusCode);
}
</code></pre>



<p>This means that you only have a single test method to maintain instead of two duplicated methods that are almost identical.</p>



<p><em>But,</em> some of the people I&#8217;ve coached might say, <em>this test has two assertions!</em></p>



<p>Indeed. So what? It&#8217;s one single <em>test case</em>: Cancelling a reservation.</p>



<p>While cancelling a reservation is a single action, we care about multiple outcomes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The status code after a successful <code>DELETE</code> request should be in the <code>200</code> range.</li>



<li>The reservation resource should be gone.</li>
</ul>



<p>Developing the system further, we might add more behaviors that we care about. Perhaps the system should also send an email about the cancellation. We should assert that as well. It&#8217;s still the same test case, though: Successfully cancelling a reservation.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with multiple assertions in a single test. The above example illustrates the benefits. A single test case can have multiple outcomes that should all be verified.</p>



<h2 id="h-origins-of-the-single-assertion-notion">Origins of the single assertion notion</h2>



<p>Where does the <em>only one assertion per test</em> notion come from? I don&#8217;t know, but I can guess.</p>



<p>The excellent book <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/ref/xunit-patterns"><em>xUnit Test Patterns</em></a> describes a test smell named <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Assertion%20Roulette.html">Assertion Roulette</a>. It describes situations where it may be difficult to determine exactly which assertion caused a test failure.</p>



<p>It looks to me as though the <em>only one assertion per test</em> &#8216;rule&#8217; stems from a misreading of the Assertion Roulette description. (I may even have contributed to that myself. I don&#8217;t remember that I have, but to be honest I&#8217;ve produced so much content about unit testing over the decades that I don&#8217;t want to assume myself free of guilt.)</p>



<p><em>xUnit Test Patterns</em> describes two causes of Assertion Roulette:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eager Test: A single test verifies too much functionality.</li>



<li>Missing Assertion Message</li>
</ul>



<p>You have an Eager Test when you&#8217;re trying to exercise more than one <em>test case</em>. You may be trying to simulate a &#8216;session&#8217; where a client performs many steps in order to achieve a goal. As Gerard Meszaros writes regarding the test smell, this is appropriate for manual tests, but rarely for automated tests. It&#8217;s not the number of assertions that cause problems, but that the test does too much.</p>



<p>The other cause occurs when the assertions are sufficiently similar that you can&#8217;t tell which one failed, and they have no assertion messages.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not the case with the above example. If the <code>Assert.True</code> assertion fails, the assertion message will tell you:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>Actual status code: NotFound.
Expected: True
Actual:   False
</code></pre>



<p>Likewise, if the <code>Assert.Equal</code> assertion fails, that too will be clear:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>Assert.Equal() Failure
Expected: NotFound
Actual:   OK
</code></pre>



<p>There&#8217;s no ambiguity.</p>



<h2 id="h-one-assertion-per-test">One assertion per test</h2>



<p>Now that you understand that multiple assertions per test are fine, you may be inclined to have a ball adding assertions like there&#8217;s no tomorrow.</p>



<p>Usually, however, there&#8217;s a germ of truth in a persistent notion like the <em>one test, one assertion</em> &#8216;rule&#8217;. Use good judgement.</p>



<p>If you consider what an automated test is, it&#8217;s basically a predicate. It&#8217;s a statement that we expect a particular outcome. We then compare the actual outcome to the expected outcome to see if they are equal. Thus, in essence, the ideal assertion is this:</p>



<pre class="s-code-block wp-block-code"><code>Assert.Equal(expected, actual);</code></pre>



<p>I can&#8217;t always attain that ideal, but whenever I can, I feel deep satisfaction. Sometimes, <code>expected</code> and <code>actual</code> are primitive values like integers or strings, but they might also be complex values that represent the subset of program state that the test cares about. <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2021/05/03/structural-equality-for-better-tests">As long as the objects have structural equality, such an assertion is meaningful</a>.</p>



<p>At other times I can&#8217;t quite find a way to express the verification step as succinctly as that. If I have to add another assertion or two, I&#8217;ll do that.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s this notion that you&#8217;re only allowed to write one assertion per unit test. It probably originates from real concerns about badly-factored test code, but over the years the nuanced test smell <em>Assertion Roulette</em> has become garbled into a simpler, but less helpful &#8216;rule&#8217;.</p>



<p>That &#8216;rule&#8217; often gets in the way of maintainable test code. Programmers following the &#8216;rule&#8217; resort to gratuitous copying and pasting instead of adding another assertion to an existing test.</p>



<p>If adding a relevant assertion to an existing test is the best way forward, don&#8217;t let a misunderstood &#8216;rule&#8217; stop you.</p>

<h2>SPONSORED BY FOURSQUARE</h2>



<iframe loading="lazy" height="200px" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless="" src="https://player.simplecast.com/02a79e78-2c05-4e5d-8cb2-74931b415ae4?dark=false"></iframe>



<p>When <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> launched in 2009, the app was consumer facing, letting you know where friends had checked in and what spots might appeal to you. People competed to be the “mayor” of certain locations and built guides to their favorite neighborhoods., The service expanded to allow merchants to offer discounts to frequent guests and track foot traffic in and out of the stores. While you can still use the Swarm app to find the best Manhattan in Manhattan, the company realized that real estate and data share the same three key rules: location, location, location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, Ben and Ryan talk with Vin Sharma, VP of Engineering at Foursquare, about how they’re finding the atomic data that makes up their location data—their location data—and going from giving insight to individual app users about the locations around them to APIs that serve these location-based insights to developers at organizations like Uber, Nextdoor, and Redfin, who want to build location based insights and features into their own apps.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-show-notes"><strong>Show notes</strong></h2>



<p>If you still want to check in at your local bakery and remember all the place you’ll go, the original Foursquare app is now <a href="https://swarmapp.com/">Swarm</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re looking to build on their data instead, you can start with <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs">their developer documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have almost 70 location attributes that they are starting to deconstruct and decompose into fundamental building blocks of their location data. Like data primitives—integers, booleans, etc.—these small bites of data can be remade with agility and at scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being a technologist is more than a 9-5 job. It’s a lifestyle. That’s why so many of us, like the mad scientists we are, get into homelabbing.</p>



<p>What does this hobby/obsession entail? Build a home lab to help you level-up your tinkering game. Think: media servers, Raspberry Pis, data centers—turning your home into an IT paradise guaranteed to make you more productive, if only it wasn&#8217;t so enticing to work on.</p>



<p>Today’s podcast episode is all about brainstorming fun ideas for homelabbing. Matt, Ceora, and Cassidy host a discussion with JJ Asghar, Developer Advocate at IBM.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>The group laughs about setting up <a href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/08/want-a-better-work-life-balance-use-jira-at-home-tsql2sday/">JIRA workflows</a> and Trello boards for our family lives—Matt says heck no.</p>



<p>Ceora speaks to the power of homelabbing as a way to gain profitable skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>JJ talks about the VPN system he has running on his phone to access his home network using tools like <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> and<a href="https://www.zerotier.com/"> ZeroTier</a>.</p>



<p>Cassidy suggests setting up a personal knowledge base as a second brain (and recommends <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>JJ shares how homelabbing is popular among kids under 18 as a pathway for them to get into the tech industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently worked on an app prototype with a friend in another industry. By day, I’m a full-stack developer targeting desktop and mobile web, but considering the use cases for this app, we determined it needs to be fully-functional offline. There are a couple of traditional ways for web developers to deliver offline experiences:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong>. With the addition of a manifest file and service worker, a responsive web app can be quickly converted to something that will load without an internet connection. Whether it will actually work is another story and really depends on how the web app was built. Typically, there’s a lot more to be done surrounding data caching, syncing, conflict resolution, and offline request handling than there is in simply <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/how-to-make-progressive-web-app">making your app a PWA</a>, and at the end of the day you still won’t have an app in either app store. For it to show up on someone’s home screen, the user will&nbsp; have to visit the website and click the <strong>Install </strong>button at the bottom of the screen, which is an unfamiliar operation and goes against most users’ muscle memory of swiping away or clicking X on anything that covers site content. I have high hopes for the future of PWAs, but right now I don’t see them as an effective way of reaching users.</li><li><strong>Cordova</strong>. <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> turns websites into mobile apps by putting them in a WebView (basically an iframe for native apps) and packaging that WebView as an iOS or Android app. While this is by far the cheapest way to bring a website to both app stores, and in theory can accomplish nearly everything a native app can, in my experience this is anything but frictionless. Both the process and the end result are full of unpleasant surprises. Even a website that works perfectly in a mobile browser may need substantial work to look and feel right as a Cordova app. Additionally, the support for native smartphone APIs is patchy and sometimes unreliable; even simple things like media controls can be frustrating to implement. So although Cordova fills an important role as the most cost-efficient way to deliver a “website in an app,” I decided it wasn’t a great choice for a new project. (I would be remiss here not to mention <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>, which really helps achieve a native look and feel but typically requires a partial or full rewrite and still doesn’t fix a lot of the problems I’ve mentioned.)</li></ol>



<p>Having ruled out those options, the remaining ones I was aware of were:</p>



<ul><li>Traditional native apps</li><li>Xamarin</li><li>React Native</li><li>Flutter</li></ul>



<p>Building traditional native apps would require me to maintain two or more codebases, and I’d be learning Swift from scratch, so that sounded like more trouble than I signed up for. Xamarin might have been a good choice since I use .NET at my day job, but my impression is that it doesn’t have the robust community or market share that the others have. I also have some relevant experience to consider: I’ve built a couple of side projects with React and have been working on a game in Flutter. In the end, React Native and Flutter seemed like the best choices for my skillset.</p>



<p>Over the course of a couple weekends, I built two proof of concept apps, one each with the latest versions of React Native and Flutter. I didn’t go into this planning to write about my experiences—I just wanted to prototype a simple app—but the comparison has turned out to be very interesting; these are two radically different frameworks, each frustrating and delightful in its own ways, and I think it’s valuable to compare and contrast them from a web developer’s perspective.</p>



<p>I don’t expect to come across totally unbiased. My experience with Flutter has been much better than with React Native. However, I’ll try my best to treat them fairly and acknowledge the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-they-work-components-and-rendering">How they work: Components and rendering</h2>



<p>React Native (created by Meta/Facebook) provides a set of React components that represent layout and UI abstractions such as a View (used for containing and arranging elements, like a `div` with `display: flex` on it) or a TextInput (like an HTML `input` or `textarea`). Then it uses a C++ engine, compiled separately for each platform, to translate those into native components for rendering on screen. Your code is run with a JavaScript engine (currently JavaScriptCore, the engine used by Safari, but a custom engine called Hermes is probably going to take over soon) and communicates with native code via serialized messages over a bridge.</p>



<p>Flutter (created by Google) is a view framework, rendering engine, code execution engine, and component library all in one. It uses Dart, a high-level programming language created and maintained by Google, and is clearly inspired by React: each widget (component) has a build (render) method that typically returns a tree of one or more other widgets. Flutter does not render native components on the target device, instead opting to take over the entire screen and render its own UI (not unlike a video game). Your Dart code is compiled ahead of time for the various instruction sets used by desktop and mobile devices. On the web, it’s transpiled to JavaScript.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-learning-process-language-and-tools">The learning process: Language and tools</h2>



<p>You might think the time needed to learn a new programming language for Flutter would be an order of magnitude greater than the time it takes to set up and learn the tools of React Native. However, I didn’t find this to be true at all. Dart is a very simple and developer-friendly language with strong similarities to TypeScript, C#, and Kotlin. Its documentation is superb. What’s more, I enjoyed learning it—it’s extremely readable and has a lot of cool features like <a href="https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#cascade-notation">cascade notation</a> and <a href="https://dart.dev/null-safety">null safety by default</a>, and the compiler is good at telling you what’s wrong. So yes, it’ll take a day or so to learn the language, but if you already know a strongly-typed imperative programming language, you’ll have an easy time of it.</p>



<p>With React Native, you won’t spend any time learning a new programming language as long as you know JavaScript or TypeScript. You will, however, have to learn some standard tools and libraries to get up to speed—and it feels like the tooling and ecosystem for React Native are far more complex than for Flutter, with no real advantage in quality (more on this in the next section). For me, the ramp-up time for both frameworks was about the same, comparing when I first learned Flutter (via Flame, a game development library) to when I learned React Native. I’d estimate minimum time to productivity at ten to fifteen hours either way.</p>



<p>I acknowledge that my case isn’t necessarily typical. There are more developers on the market who are conversant in React than in any form of Dart, so there are a lot of business scenarios where React Native may make more sense. But for your own projects, don’t let the Dart barrier hold you back.</p>



<h2 id="h-features-there-ain-t-no-party-like-a-first-party">Features: There ain’t no party like a first party</h2>



<p>React Native follows the standard approach to web development characterized by your local `node_modules` folder. It includes the basic tools you need to have an app, but if you want a UI language (like <a href="https://material.io/design">Material Design</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/">Cupertino</a>), icons, state management, localization, HTTP requests, advanced developer tools, and so forth, you’ll be relying on community-supported code or writing your own. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The React Native community is large and very active. But it does mean that a typical React Native app is going to be a patchwork quilt of packages representing different design philosophies, non-standardized APIs, and hit-or-miss documentation.</p>



<p>By comparison, Google has invested heavily in Flutter over the last several years and supports an impressive feature set out of the box: Material Design and Cupertino components, hundreds of icons, a basic state management setup, several runtime developer tools, and 25 core first-party packages including localization, HTTP requests, and more—all with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking">tree-shaking</a> so you don’t bloat your app with anything you’re not using. The components I’ve used all have a consistent design and fit the framework like a glove. You could ship a powerful and well-designed Flutter app without any third-party packages at all, which just isn’t feasible with React Native. The difference in size between my `package.json` file in React Native and my `pubspec.yaml` file in Flutter is staggering. Flutter just does more.</p>



<p>Or, I should say, it does more off the shelf. Dart’s package repository, <a href="https://pub.dev/">pub.dev</a>, will probably never approach the size of NPM. It’s hard to estimate how many NPM packages are compatible with React Native considering that it doesn’t have access to browser or Node APIs, but I’d guess there are still more than enough to win the quantity battle.</p>



<p>If you’re confident in your ability to write uncommon algorithms or visuals on your own, you’ll probably be fine with either framework. Otherwise, you’ll want to snoop around in each package repository before you start and see if they have what you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-ui-platforms-consistency-and-customization">The UI: Platforms, consistency, and customization</h2>



<p>I had some trouble getting my UI to look the same across platforms with both Flutter and React Native. Flutter ships with its own graphics engine, so you’d think everything would be identical wherever you go. But I did notice a couple of differences in spacing and alignment between the web, MacOS, and iOS outputs that I wasn’t able to fix. Though they were very minor, single-pixel differences—I doubt an end user would even notice—they did make me twitch a little.</p>



<p>Since React Native renders native components on each platform, there’s almost no way for it to have fewer consistency issues than Flutter. And sure enough, I spent most of one Sunday cursing at my computer over an app bar that worked fine on web but disappeared and crashed the debugger on iOS, with no helpful error messages in sight. The problem ended up being an intersection of issues between my iPhone 12 simulator, a third-party design library I was using, and some custom styles. I have yet to encounter anything quite that elusive with Flutter.</p>



<p>Speaking of styles, React Native uses CSS. It’s slightly more complicated than that, but if you’re comfortable with CSS (and, importantly, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>) you’ll be right at home making things look however you want in React Native. Flutter’s styling mechanism, though different, isn’t entirely foreign—most CSS-like properties are represented by widget fields of the same name, and the Column and Row widgets are straightforward stand-ins for flex layouts. Still, you’ll probably have to look up each thing you’re trying to do or peek at widget code rather than plugging in some CSS properties and going on your merry way. The compositional paradigm of Flutter also takes some getting used to; a lot of the things you might usually apply with a CSS property have their own widget in Flutter.</p>



<p>Both frameworks are very customizable. If you’ve got pixel-perfect designs to work from, you’ll quickly get into the groove of building components to match.</p>



<h2 id="h-performance-responsive-ux-and-animations">Performance: Responsive UX and animations</h2>



<p>Flutter’s big selling point from the very beginning has been speed. The framework’s marketing demos are full of sweeping full-screen animations that never miss a frame. And, from my experience building a simple game with it, I can vouch for its ability to handle whatever you throw at it. It’s smooth. In fact, the reason I turned to Flutter in the first place was because I was tired of watching sprites glitch and stagger across the screen on an HTML5 canvas.</p>



<p>That isn’t to say Flutter will ever be faster than a native app. Even if the performance is visually similar to native, you’ve still got a full non-native rendering engine running on top of the hardware. At the very least you’re going to be using more memory.</p>



<p>React Native doesn’t put up much of a fight in the performance category. It’s interpreting JavaScript in the background, then playing middleman between a JavaScript engine and native code. We already know JavaScript is relatively slow. This adds a whole new translation layer to it.</p>



<p>That said, both are more than fast enough. I wouldn’t recommend trying to build an immersive first-person shooter in either (although Flutter would doubtless manage it better) but that’s not what you’re here for, is it? When we’re talking about text forms and business logic, there’s no point quibbling over ten or twenty milliseconds of response time. The decisions you make as a programmer will make far more impact on the user experience than the framework running under the hood.</p>



<p>The one caveat to this is animation. The Flutter team has worked hard to make their framework synonymous with beautiful, touch-responsive animations. If you want to build an app that surrounds the user with ripples and flourishes, Flutter is where it’s at.</p>



<h2 id="h-pipelines-building-and-releasing-your-app">Pipelines: Building and releasing your app</h2>



<p>Perhaps the single biggest thing keeping React Native developers from jumping ship is <a href="https://expo.dev/">Expo</a>. Expo is a private company that provides developer tooling and services for React Native apps, including a managed cross-platform runtime, native API modules, and an automatic deployment tool for both app stores. Expo also provides an app called Expo Go that lets you test your apps on a smartphone without sideloading or using a wired connection; just point your camera at a generated QR code and you’re all set. It’s an impressive offering.</p>



<p>Flutter doesn’t have an equivalent service. There’s <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a>, which fills some of the gaps in the release automation department, and of course Flutter has a cross-platform runtime built in. But if you want to test your Flutter apps on a physical smartphone you’ll have to plug it into your laptop and move some .apk or .ipa files around (or have your IDE move them for you). Both Android and iPhone have good first-party simulators available, so you won’t necessarily be doing this on a daily basis. But it is less convenient than using Expo Go.</p>



<h2 id="h-developer-experience-being-in-the-trenches">Developer experience: Being in the trenches</h2>



<p>This section will be more subjective than the others. I’m sure a lot of developers love the React Native experience, and plenty have their frustrations with Flutter. But for me, Flutter was so much easier to use and work with than React Native it was ridiculous. There are a few objective points in Flutter’s favor here—hot reloading, tighter VS Code integration, and more extensive built-in debugging tools—but I can’t say any of those were a deciding factor.</p>



<p>My proof-of-concept app consists of an app bar, a list of clickable tiles, a form with some numeric inputs, a few equations, and an output table. I had never built any of these things in either framework before.</p>



<p>It took me twice as long to build in React Native as in Flutter.</p>



<p>Most of that time is accounted for by head-scratching over basic things: project setup, icons, the disappearing app bar I mentioned earlier, cryptic CLI warnings, getting a controlled input to work. And since I built the React Native app first, there were a couple things I could copy and paste to save time on the Flutter app. But when I look back on the experience, the time difference isn’t even what stands out. It’s that I was almost constantly frustrated with React Native and almost constantly delighted with Flutter. Flutter always had what I needed and it worked perfectly. React Native pointed me to an NPM package and a Stack Overflow answer and said “good luck.”</p>



<p>Again, this is my own experience. I’m sure with time I’d get used to the quirks of React Native and discover things I dislike about Flutter. But there’s no question in my mind of what I want to use in the future: Flutter, every time.</p>



<p>Your mileage will vary. For an alternate perspective, <a href="https://shift.infinite.red/flutter-is-better-than-react-native-fed10c92a768">Jamon Holmgren’s article favoring React Native</a> is definitely worth a read. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8ipUgXH6jw">Fireship’s comparison video</a> provides a balanced perspective covering many of the same points I’ve talked about here.</p>



<h2 id="h-summary-the-best-framework-is-the-one-you-use">Summary: The best framework is the one you use</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for a smooth and integrated developer experience, all business implications aside, I can’t recommend Flutter highly enough. But there’s a lot of exciting news in the React Native camp these days and it makes a strong case for itself in terms of easier hiring and massive open-source community support. There’s more than enough buzz to go around; this year’s Stack Overflow Developer Survey has Flutter and React Native <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-misc-tech">neck-and-neck</a>, with RN slightly ahead in the “Professional Developers” category and Flutter slightly ahead in the “All Respondents” category. (Both are pretty far ahead of Ionic, Cordova, and Xamarin.)</p>



<p>Objectively speaking, there’s no clear winner here. You’ll pick a framework based on the needs and constraints of your app, just as you’d do with any technological decision. React Native clearly isn’t going anywhere, and a year from now the developer experience may be much improved thanks to the steady pace of community contributions. But for my money, Flutter is here to stay and will grow substantially in the short term as developers discover how powerful and easy to use it is.</p>

<p>Quantum computing has applications across communications, network building, financial modeling, cybersecurity, AI, and so much more. But getting involved with these projects has traditionally taken years of education at the most advanced academic levels. According to Helmut Katzgraber, Global Practice Lead at Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab, the scientific community could be doing a better job inviting more people to participate in discovering breakthroughs. </p>



<p>In today’s podcast episode, Ben, Matt, and Ryan reflect on Katzgraber’s experience in the field, along with the steps he is taking to broaden access to education on quantum computing.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>Katzgraber speaks to&nbsp;<a href="https://katzgraber.org/contact/">his time as a university professor up until 2020</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He shares why he enjoys working at Amazon.</p>



<p>He walks us through a quantum computing challenge that he hosted with BMW <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/a-guide-to-bmws-quantum-computing-for-automotive-challenges/">through his role at Amazon</a> (and what real world applications he sees emerging from similar collaboration experiments).</p>



<p>We discuss what inspires him to stay curious — raising the bar for scientific research, crowdsourcing breakthroughs, and opening up the playing field for more people to jump in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We know asking your first question on Stack Overflow can be a bit intimidating. Whether you are a new user on the platform or have been on the site for many years, crafting your question takes time and effort. Well, have no fear, the Ask Wizard is here to help you ask the perfect question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ask Wizard provides step-by-step instructions to first-time askers to ensure they can create high-quality questions from the start.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1196" height="630" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Question-Format-1196x630.png" alt="Image of the first step in the Ask Wizard with instructions on how to write a good title." class="wp-image-21044" srcset="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Question-Format-1196x630.png 1196w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Question-Format-300x158.png 300w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Question-Format-768x405.png 768w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Question-Format-1536x809.png 1536w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Question-Format.png 1600w " sizes="(max-width: 1196px) 100vw, 1196px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-does-the-ask-wizard-work"><strong>How does the Ask Wizard work?</strong></h2>



<p>Automatically displayed for first-time question-askers, the Ask Wizard is split into several steps, each of which provides instructions to help make sure questions are high quality and benefit the entire Stack Overflow community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The steps are eventually combined into a thoughtful, Stack Overflow ready question. Check out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/askwizard">these screenshots</a> to see how the Ask Wizard is organized and works to help you create a great question.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-question-askers-benefit-from-the-ask-wizard"><strong>How do question-askers benefit from the Ask Wizard?</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve heard from both new and existing Stack Overflow users about the challenges of asking high-quality questions on our sites. With the Ask Wizard, we&#8217;re simplifying question-asking by including many of the best practices we’ve heard from the community on how to ask a good question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re hoping that asking a question can turn from a potentially intimidating experience into one that is more approachable and even fun.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-the-community-benefit-from-the-ask-wizard"><strong>How does the Community benefit from the Ask Wizard?</strong></h2>



<p>The Ask Wizard will improve the quality of questions on our site and help avoid duplicate questions from being asked on Stack Overflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After testing the Ask Wizard, we also found it <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/418491/ask-wizard-test-results-and-next-steps">improved question completion rates and reduced the percentage of questions that were deleted</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the Ask Wizard will lead to better questions and overall site experience for the entire community.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-i-get-started-with-the-ask-wizard"><strong>How do I get started with the Ask Wizard?</strong></h2>



<p>The Ask Wizard will be automatically displayed to first-time question-askers on Stack Overflow. Experienced askers can also toggle it on or off and create questions through the Ask Wizard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s time again for a quarterly update. I always like to use this quarterly post to pause and reflect on our impact at a micro and a macro level, but I am especially reflective given I just completed my third year as CEO of Stack Overflow and on the other side of our inaugural conference for technology leaders, Stack Overflow’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/07/missed-our-flow-state-conference-catch-up-on-all-the-sessions/">Flow State</a>. We’re fortunate to continue to grow at a rapid pace. In dynamic times, whether it be in times of hyper growth or in times of market volatility, we are seeing from our community and customers alike that breaking down the barriers to knowledge is essential for success.</p>



<p>As I mentioned, last month we hosted our first conference for technology leaders, Stack Overflow’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/07/missed-our-flow-state-conference-catch-up-on-all-the-sessions/">Flow State</a>, in New York City and online. It was incredible to see so many people engaged in-person and virtually who are impacted by the work we are doing. Throughout the day, we heard from technology leaders at companies like Capgemini, Etsy, Indeed, and Salesforce about how they’re tackling major transformations, managing distributed environments, and empowering their developers and technologists to be more productive. Through multiple stories on stage, it was clear that creating easier ways for teams to onboard and learn as they work is just as critical on small teams as large teams. Stack Overflow’s suite of products, <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/teams/">Stack Overflow for Teams</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/advertising/">Stack Overflow Advertising</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/talent/">Stack Overflow Talent</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/collectives/">Collectives on Stack Overflow</a>, are doing just that.</p>



<p>I started my opening keynote by discussing major industry challenges like the fact that global talent shortage is expected to reach <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/06/08/is-there-a-developer-shortage-yes-but-the-problem-is-more-complicated-than-it-looks/?sh=5c7d316d3b8e">85.2 million by 2030</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ugEoqiXjMk-Q4a4NQrSOEHSAWfUa_R9Trywp_bBUePPEF_OEPf2KX080uy3h084lPG-aICY7O7aGFrYW7L3ZxdXOYVeAbZautlX_rdTyIf4dySigB4-C7M382NowbzSd67MFWGSXGQzJ5TK3zNCe5GP7hrR_ZMX7En8_0mjm8QQgrQ2xa0W5N2xBQA" alt="Prashanth presents at the Flow State conference"/></figure>



<p>At a macro level, we need to empower non-traditional learning so that the talent pool can expand faster to meet growing market demand. We have an opportunity to help individuals just as much as we help businesses. The average cost for a top 10 computer science undergraduate degree is over $38,000 per year depending on where you live and what school you go to. Yet, the median household income in the U.S. is just under $68,000 per year. At Stack Overflow, we’ve always seen it as our responsibility to ensure technical learning resources are accessible to all. Breaking down the barriers of entry to learn is one of the core reasons I joined Stack Overflow three years ago last month. I truly believe that in times of change, accessible learning will create great opportunities for all.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4FXH8mXEY3o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<h2 id="h-accessible-learning-is-the-birthplace-of-innovation">Accessible learning is the birthplace of innovation</h2>



<p>On the heels of my three year anniversary here at Stack Overflow, I can’t help but think about my career and how I got here. I often reflect back to when my father came home from a business trip decades ago with my first computer: a 286. Basic as it is compared to today’s standards, it represented limitless opportunities to me. It catalyzed my pursuit of a career in technology through exploration and learning. That desire to learn and contribute to something bigger exists in so many throughout the world, especially within aspiring technologists. In order to better our world, we must foster and not hamper that excitement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZQ9lp4JXWA-ZEt7NyzxxQNhtWGxwgtfwNA-aq0jUxPUbgN_MmWRkYhHcQitKQDS2tnEiLxt14PF3H0JHIt3je2e1b_eP1bDODFmRzdu6cbzxl4HO1uxpHOGawDuW07eNeRU1W0qA6RZNRHJlzB0yC6xmOUKsciuZPMJoaeLEN-mFGYi6HdRJvJ4_9A" alt="Text reads, &quot;We're making online coding resources accessible to all.&quot; Shows a globe with the logos for Kiwix, BPI, IceCube, and Code 4000."/></figure>



<p>Stack Overflow’s dedication to making technical resources accessible is one of the core reasons I joined the company. I only wish Stack Overflow existed when I was learning to code many years ago! Over the past year, we took that commitment a step further with <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/20/introducing-the-overflow-offline-project/">Overflow Offline</a>. Announced this month, Overflow Offline is a downloadable version of the public platform created in partnership with <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a> as a resource for organizations that serve communities with limited access to the internet. We removed perhaps the biggest barrier of entry for technical learning—access to the internet. Whether it’s researchers in Antarctica, students that live in internet deserts, or courses for incarcerated individuals in the United States and the United Kingdom, Overflow Offline extends the impact of Stack Overflow to people previously without access to technical learning resources.</p>



<p>We also launched our first <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/08/29/stack-overflow-student-ambassador-program-how-to-apply/">Student Ambassador program</a> in partnership with <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking</a> (MLH) to accelerate learning across the public platform, participate in challenges, earn rewards, and more. We’re on track to reach over 200 universities and connect with over 10,000 students this year.</p>



<p>For the 100 million people that already visit Stack Overflow every month, we introduced <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/04/meet-saves-the-tool-to-help-you-organize-your-favorite-content-on-stack-overflow/">Saves</a> this month. According to research we conducted in April 2022, we found that 62% of survey respondents use bookmarks to save content for future use. This includes saving a question so that they can reference it later, building a repository, and creating a collection of high-quality content about a specific topic. Beyond bookmarking answers, Saves allows users to create custom lists and private notes on saved posts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9luyhqzDSYvHfg0Nexc_MhaDZzotY3VmxaHSLnqAANmPgsPxrhM8xYBVp4v1bLCe9_gTy_FdDiU1bCO8_1VBPx8k2PprL7iPqxtnIb5tlK-Ja2WaCZKsMaQE2itj1a5wMUkD2Y90D0WJACD-RbKpSzX76pCbSa05Eh8Ev0Zl8MszkDzUV3mvpoHlGg" alt="Introducing Saves blog post header image"/></figure>



<p>Our vision is to become the most valuable destination for the world&#8217;s current and next generation of technologists. Breaking down barriers so that the community can grow, learn, and build innovative technologies faster is core to everything we do.</p>



<h2 id="h-creating-opportunities-to-learn-starts-within-your-team">Creating opportunities to learn starts within your team</h2>



<p>Just as developers and technologists are learning in their free time, they spend an incredible amount of time at work evolving their skills. That’s not always easy given a whopping 62% of developers spend over eight hours a month searching for answers, and 46% of developers spend over eight hours a month answering others&#8217; questions. On top of all that, over 50% of devs encounter knowledge silos every week. Breaking down barriers for teams to learn from each other helps our customers scale and optimize so that developers are happy and stay in their flow state.</p>



<p>One of my favorite visuals of this is the chart I shared at Flow State (below). With Stack Overflow for Teams, Progressive saw saw two thirds of questions answered by folks in departments different from the person who asked the question. When you eliminate barriers between teams, you can unlock limitless cross-functional learning. You don’t need to have all the answers, and chances are you don’t, not even on a single team. You just need to know where to find the answers you need, when you need them. Sustaining that flow of knowledge between teams is where we focused much of our efforts over the last year. For example, monthly editing activity increased by over 600% in just 90 days among Stack Overflow for Teams customers using <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/company/press/archive/content-health">Content Health</a>. Ensuring that knowledge remains resilient is the foundation of resilient teams.</p>

It found that with Stack Overflow for Teams, employees saw an overall reduction in interruptions, with 65-85% of employee questions already answered in Stack Overflow for Teams. Forrester’s research concluded that Stack Overflow delivered $14.42 million in benefits to the composite customer over three years and cost $4.95 million over the same time period. This puts the net present value (NPV) of Stack Overflow for Teams just shy of $9.5 million, with a return on investment (ROI) of 191%.</p>

<p>We recently shared that <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/08/04/great-engineering-cultures-are-built-on-social-learning-communities/">Stack Overflow is named as a Sample Vendor in the 2022 Gartner® Hype Cycle<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> for Agile and DevOps for Communities of Practice. This is a powerful step forward in enabling organizations of all sizes to build strong internal communities that foster collective learning.</p>



<p>Our customers continue to share their experiences on G2, leading to Stack Overflow for Teams being named as a leader by G2 in the Knowledge Management and Q&amp;A Platform categories for the 15th consecutive quarter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5KwwGcAfGo2APc1M3UmwVBUF11YRjVqwFhLKzh66YzacsHyVRgXy3hffc2Ho9UonQ5fEkizurF1xZAY7TJv5CWHbGzvyLmDxONoU8soM9PA7Vruk4et2laZDCK_HAXWUQt94B0-eY-Ppi2u7MPakcvOZFxcEjOMfsv37VcSFFCePSukKt4XRoAS5Qg" alt="Images of the G2 customer awards that Stack Overflow won this quarter"/></figure>



<p>To continue powering the flow state, we’ve always allowed people to leverage Stack Overflow’s API to embed tailored access directly into workflows. That also extends to Stack Overflow for Teams, which helps organizations like Spotify and their open source initiative, <a href="https://backstage.io/">Backstage</a>. They use the API to <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/09/19/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-do-what-backstage-does-for-free/">deeply integrate Stack Overflow into Backstage</a> to allow both active searching of public and team-only Stack Overflow answers, alongside information held only in Backstage. <a href="https://apiworld.co/awards/#winners">Stack Overflow for Teams won an API Award</a> for the Communications API category for innovation, adoption, and reception by the developer community. Just another way breaking down barriers leads to innovative solutions for all.</p>



<h2 id="h-looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>



<p>We accomplished a lot in the past few months, and we will continue building on recent momentum as we head towards the end of the calendar year. I find it so energizing to see some of these initiatives come to life. Meeting so many users, customers, and technology leaders at Flow State, seeing Student Ambassadors engage through our programs, and hearing about the impact of Overflow Offline are all powerful ways we’re continuing to make an impact.</p>



<p>Of course, we cannot stress enough the importance of breaking down barriers to learn without examining how we are doing the same here at Stack Overflow. This month we’re rolling out what we call, “Learn, Share, Grow Days” (LSG Days) so that Stackers have the space and time to learn apart from their daily job tasks. This becomes even more important as we continue to hire across the globe. We accelerated growth during the summer months (summer here in the U.S., I should say), surpassing 200 Stackers hired in the last six months and surpassing over 500 employees for the first time in company history.</p>

<p>On Freund was one of the minds behind the scenes of the now-iconic WeWork startup story. He held three roles at the company: VP of Engineering, VP of Product, and Global Head of Markets at WeWork Labs. The software his team built demonstrated rigor, engineering grit, and strong logic. It’s the reason why WeWork is, at its core, a tech company. </p>



<p>Now, Freund has entered into a new season of his career as co-founder and CEO of Wilco, which is a platform for developers of every skill level to advance in their talents and career journeys. Like a flight simulator, it offers challenges that are meant to prepare developers for the realities of what they will face on the job, moving beyond what they might learn in a classroom or boot camp to scenarios taken from real workplace experiences.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong><br><br>Freund reflects on his early days at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.appliedmaterials.com/">Applied Materials</a>, where he worked on a machine that inspected silicon wafers.</p>



<p>It was in this early role that Freund gained an appreciation for rigorous software testing protocols in the manufacturing process.</p>



<p>At WeWork, Freund was fascinated by the idea of a full stack business, which is a business building itself.</p>



<p>While Freund officially launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trywilco.com/">Wilco</a>&nbsp;in 2021, the origin story for the company dates back to 2013 when he was hiring and managing a team of engineers—he saw a need in the market to help developers build critical skills to problems-solve in real-time.</p>



<p>You can think of Wilco as the equivalent of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/">flight simulator</a>&nbsp;for engineers.</p>

<h2>SPONSORED BY LOGITECH</h2>



<p>It may be tempting to think that a developer’s productivity directly correlates with their speed on the keyboard. After all, your programming speed is limited by the speed you can enter in the characters needed to create the lines of code that compose software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is, in fact, a terrible measure of productivity. Your speed on a keyboard doesn’t indicate how productive you are, just as the number of lines of code or commits you make doesn’t indicate how good an application is. This is the mistake that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html">bossware</a> applications make, gauging whether employees are doing their jobs well by watching their keystrokes and mouse movements. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-executives-call-remote-employee-surveillance-spying-wrong-2022-9">That’s measuring heat, not outcomes</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s true that a lot of a developer’s time is spent gliding atop a keyboard, translating their thoughts into code—doubly so if they use <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/">Emacs</a>, or another console-based text editor. For those of us chasing the productive rush of a flow state, it’ll often start with the interface between your fingers and the computer: the humble keyboard. Keyboards (and mice) won’t necessarily help you get into a flow state, but the good ones like <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/mx/mx-for-coding.html">MX Master Series</a> can help keep you there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll talk about the research around developers and flow states, defeating distractions that pull you out of focus, and how the best tools are the ones that you forget about.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-flow-states-and-the-software-developer">Flow states and the software developer</h2>



<p>A flow state—or focused state—is when you become so involved in your task that you lose track of time and the world around you to concentrate deeply and wholly on the work at hand. It’s a pleasurable state that many of us seek out, but only recognize that we’ve been in it when we emerge from it and realize we forgot to eat lunch. Being in a state of flow feels really good because you were creating something that matches your skills doing what you like to do.</p>



<p>As software developers, flow states happen when you are solving problems that are equal to your skills. You need a challenging enough task. If the work isn’t challenging enough, then you might get bored. If it’s too challenging for your skillset, then you may get frustrated and distracted. You are able to rise to the challenge, but are required to invest your full self in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Naturally, work in front of a computer has a natural ebb and flow. Dr. Gloria Mark of the University of California, Irvine, found that a work week for information workers has <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/Home_page/Publications_files/Focus%20_1.pdf">a predictable pattern</a>. Focus peaks in the late afternoon, while boredom is highest in the early afternoon. Monday is both the most boring, but also the most focused. In terms of the work, people are happiest doing rote work and most stressed during focused work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professor Thomas Fritz of the University of Zurich (who we spoke to for this article) found that developers spend about 50% of their workday in front of their computers. Half of that time was spent in their IDE working on code. While writing and reading code takes up only a quarter of a software engineer’s day, that is the time when they need to focus most. Any edge to reduce stress and improve flow helps. </p>



<p>How do these researchers know when a person is in a flow state? The simplest is to ask them at regular intervals—display a popup on screen or a smartwatch <a href="https://hasel.dev/publication/software-developers-perceptions-of-productivity/">every 10 minutes or hour</a>. While that’s an effective research tactic, somewhat ironically those requests can create disruptions and break focused states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the surprising findings from Prof. Fritz’s research was that much of what we consider a productive state is individual perception. During some of the self-reporting studies, the hourly check-in that asked about their productivity encouraged developers to reflect on how they were spending their time. The very act of taking a break and considering their work made some feel better about the way they spent their time, and thus they perceived themselves as more productive than without self-reflection. <a href="https://hasel.dev/publication/retrospecting-on-work-and-productivity-a-study-on-self-monitoring-software-developers-work/">For others</a>, the self-reflection helped them reconsider their activities and change something if they were not efficient. <br>Additionally, developers perceived themselves as more productive <a href="https://hasel.dev/the-work-life-of-developers-activities-switches-and-perceived-productivity-accepted-at-tse17/">the more time they spent on the keyboard and mouse</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers also tried various biometric measures, as focused states often correlate with stress indicators: electrodermal skin activity, blink rate, and heart rate variability. All these biometric measures (collected from low-invasive sensors), however, were as good as or worse than <a href="https://hasel.dev/sensing-interruptibility-in-the-office-a-field-study-on-the-use-of-biometric-and-computer-interaction-sensors/">just monitoring keyboard and mouse activity</a>. Though the measurement techniques were the most invasive—Prof. Fritz&#8217;s team was essentially keylogging without logging the specific keypresses—they were able to predict focus states quite well. </p>



<p>While keyboard and mouse use can be highly correlated with productivity, there is no exact path from a keyboard to a flow state; if such a magic process existed, we would all be utilizing it. That said, a mechanical keyboard can help with a developer’s perception of productivity. Something as simple as a key producing a click both when pressed down and when released can make you feel twice as productive, <a href="https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/25863/what-is-the-difference-between-conditioning-and-learning">a Pavlovian response</a> to auditory stimuli. When a keyboard feels good, it can be easier to be productive with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While productivity can be a difficult and subjective thing to measure, we can be fairly certain of what it is not: interruptions and distractions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-minimizing-distractions-with-good-tools">Minimizing distractions with good tools</h2>



<p>Another way to think about focused states is frames of mind in which you are less interruptible. Where focused states channel your attention to a single task, some attentional states are more diffuse and make you <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/Home_page/Publications_files/CSCW%202015%20Focused.pdf">more susceptible to notifications and other distractions</a>. Depending on the tasks that an information worker does, they may spend a lot of time open to distractions from email and chat programs, context switching between small tasks, or&nbsp; attending meetings. Others may spend a lot of time in focused states, writing code or debugging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You are not immune from distractions when you are in less-interruptible flow states. But distraction can be detrimental to your focus. Dr. Mark found that <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/CHI2005.pdf">it takes an average of 23 minutes to recover focus</a> following a distraction, a significant loss of productivity.</p>



<p>Professor Fritz and his team used the data from the biometric and keyboard and mouse studies above to identify interruptible states. They used subjective measurements plus machine learning classification to automatically determine whether a person could be interrupted without breaking a flow state. This determination was fed into <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hasel.dev/publication/reducing-interruptions/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1668613725281222&amp;usg=AOvVaw10EyLAVGYhN_BfKsRAGnyy">an LED light</a> (as well as the status for chat programs) to produce red, yellow, and green statuses. Modeled after traffic lights, red means they are focused, and green means they are open to interruptions. After testing this in the field with 450 participants, the research team found that this status indicator was accurate about 75% of the time. It’s not perfect, but good enough to maintain flow states. Think of it like the status indicator on a chat app telling people you’re available or away, but this one automatically updates to match your state of mind.</p>



<p>You can use your existing hardware and software to minimize distractions by both reducing them and making potential context switches more seamless. Think about the applications that you have open—there’s plenty that pop up notifications or otherwise demand your attention. You can help by cleaning up your desktop and minimizing those applications that are not currently in your current task’s context. Software, too, can help by graying out anything that is not currently in your workflow or making it easier to jump into the application that you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes context switches are part of a single workflow. Imagine a build process that takes five to ten minutes. You can jump over to email, answer some quick questions, and be back to test the build without interruption. That workstream is more productive than just staying in the build process context. Other times, it may be that you hit an information roadblock, switch over to Stack Overflow to find answers, and pop back to your IDE. But many of us have a horde of tabs open in our browsers, making it more likely that we’ll be distracted and wondering why we switched to the browser in the first place. If your workflow includes jumping between a browser window regularly, consider limiting the number of tabs that you have open in any given window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes a context switch can be as simple as moving from keyboard and mouse. Look at how many developers thrive on command line tools or console text editors like Vim. There may be an initial learning curve, but once you have the shortcut memorized, it becomes so much more fluid to work with everything you need beneath your ten fingertips. If you have customizable keyboards where you can customize shortcuts, then you’ll be able to move even faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your hardware itself can be a distraction sometimes. Many mice and keyboards are wireless these days. Poor wireless connectivity or limited battery life can halt a productive coding session instantly. If you have a mouse that goes too slow or too fast between points, that can trip you up as well. If your hardware is doing its job, you shouldn’t even know it’s there.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-designing-for-invisibility">Designing for invisibility</h2>



<p>If we’re creating keyboards and mice for maximal productivity, we want the user to think about them as little as possible. We want them to disappear. Whenever you have to look at your keyboard to orient yourself, whenever you think about where your hand is on your mouse, you slow down. Think about a tennis player: the racquet should be an extension of their hand. If it feels off, if they have to look at the racquet, something is wrong and they’ll play worse. The starting point for any tool is comfort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we hear from a lot of developers is that they want to type as fast as they think. When they are in a flow state, they want the keyboard to act as an extension of their hands, so code solutions go from their brain to the screen as fast as possible. We don’t often think about it, but being able to effortlessly move from one keypress to the next makes a huge difference to typing speed. In fact, it has mattered for a long time—<a href="https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/139379/1/42_161.pdf">the original QWERTY layout</a> went through a long development process to best support telegraph operators, though alternative layouts like DVORAK may or may not be faster for more modern communicators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A comfortable, ergonomic device can save you in the long run. We’ve all seen carpal tunnel cases increase over the years, especially as more of us moved to work daily on computers. An injury like this can affect your long-term productivity, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486220/">ergonomic keyboards can mitigate pain even after suffering an injury</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mice, in particular, can be a challenge to design ergonomically. While the design of the human hand hasn’t changed for thousands of years, there is great variability in the size of individual hands, particularly between men and women. We at Logitech have iterated over the past five generations of the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.910-006556.html">MX Master mouse</a>, trying to find the ideal shape for all hand sizes. We made a conscious decision in the fifth generation to not change the touchpoints; people love the current design, so hopefully we’ve got it close to right. For people with smaller hands, we have <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-anywhere-3.910-005833.html">MX Anywhere</a>, our mobile mouse that is smaller for portability, but if you have smaller hands, it works as a primary mouse.</p>



<p>For our MX keyboards, we’ve worked to include small details that make it easier to maintain flow states. Many of us have worked hard to learn touch typing and perfect our keyboard shortcuts, so any glance at the keyboard itself can take us out of the flow. Our<a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.html"> mechanical keyboards</a> have a two-tone color scheme so you can get a sense of where your fingers are from your peripheral vision. For those times that you ride your flow through sunset, our mechanical keyboards automatically adjust their backlighting to the ambient light around you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laptop trackpads have done a lot to innovate new gestures to switch between apps, make the current app fullscreen, and more. We wanted to bring those gestures to mice as well, so we added a button to our MX Master mouse that lets you switch between workspaces or go full screen, similar to the three finger swipes on Mac trackpads. For those with a multitude of tabs in web browsers, we added a thumb wheel that scrolls between tabs. We even looked to upgrade the standard scroll wheel so that a slow scroll will step line by line through a screen, while spinning the wheel will disengage the ratchet and cover a thousand lines of code in a second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our power users switch between the ultimate contexts: separate computers. For some, they develop on a Mac and have to test on a PC or Linux. For others working from home, they want to seamlessly jump between work and home computers. Some of our hardware has a button that lets you instantly move the hardware between computers via Bluetooth. Our ultimate solution, though, is software we call Flow. It lets you treat multiple computers like an extended monitor. Move your mouse to the edge of your Mac’s screen and suddenly you are on your Windows desktop!&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-working-at-the-speed-of-thought">Working at the speed of thought</h2>



<p>While not all of our jobs as software developers takes place in front of a keyboard, that realm ends up being some of our most focused work. When we’re solving problems that require us to bring our full skills to bear, that’s when we want to minimize distractions and get into the flow. So maintaining flow can depend a good bit on the interface you have between your brain and the computer: your keyboard and mouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here at Logitech, we try to design hardware that contributes to flow states and eliminates distractions. Organizations chase a lot of metrics to try and optimize productivity and velocity, but the best metric may be comfort. The more that your keyboard and mouse become and extension of your hand, the closer you can come to coding at the speed of thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Logitech is pleased to extend a limited-time offer for all coders on the MX Master Series, with the code USLOGI4CODERS (US only) or LOGI4CODERS (non-US). Offer valid on <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/mx/mx-for-coding.html#logi-for-coders">logitech.com</a> until 1st November. Participating markets are US, UK and Germany.</p>

<p>Human beings are easily excitable creatures. We pump ourselves full of sugar, and then we crash. The cycle repeats. Now, here we are at a unique moment in Internet consciousness where we’ve experienced multiple crypto winters in addition to the phenomenon known as Dogecoin. Satoshi, wherever he may be, must be #facepalm to the moon. So should we take this stuff seriously—especially those of us who quit our jobs for crypto vaporware?</p>



<p>On today’s podcast, we have an open source OG sharing his voice of reason—to show us what’s real in an avalanche of digital nonsense. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnkdevadoss/">John deVadoss</a> spent 18 years as a general manager at Microsoft where he helped build .NET and VSCode, among other things, during the early evolution of what are now widely adopted, even pivotal pieces of technology .</p>



<p>So what brought him to blockchain land?</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>John explains that Web3 is about the convergence of technology, economics, and social trends.</p>



<p>He elaborates that foundations begin with service-based architecture (SOA), the notion of how to design loosely coupled systems that consist of economic services and components.</p>



<p>He goes on to explain how DeFi represents this thinking of a loose composition of services.</p>



<p>With all of this, blockchain brings together technology and economic incentives into a holistic equation—people contribute because they want to contribute.</p>



<p>Nonsense it is not, says baby Yoda.</p>



<p>Crypto isn’t the end game. It’s a segue along the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jessica Hicklin was 16 when she entered a juvenile correctional facility. Earlier this year, after 26 years, she left the justice system a free woman, and set to work in her new role, as CTO of <a href="http://unlockedlabs.org/">Unlocked Labs</a>. The organization supports coding education programs in three prisons across the state of Missouri, and runs a development shop at one prison, empowering currently incarcerated individuals to build software that improves access to education in prison more broadly. Key to their success, says Hicklin, is the knowledge contributed by the Stack Overflow community over the years. “It was the difference in making our project work. Unlocked Labs would not exist without Stack Overflow.”</p>



<p>Many coders would say they rely on Stack Overflow to get work done, but Hicklin’s situation is different. She had no access to the internet while incarcerated. “My experience with the internet ended with America Online and dial-up modems.” At first she relied on textbooks, but they were often out of date. Eventually, a friend who worked in tech sent her an XML file containing Stack Overflow’s quarterly data dump. With that raw material, Hicklin and her co-founder built out a curriculum and learning management system that is now utilized by individuals studying through Unlocked Labs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we’re happy to announce a new initiative called Overflow Offline. We’re working with a non-profit, <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a>, to ensure that an up-to-date version of our dataset is easily available for those who need it, and will work to improve its readability and reduce its size so there is less friction for end users. Unlocked Labs is one of the organizations we’ll be working with, but there are many others, spanning from the justice system, to scientific research, to university education in areas where internet access is scarce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We first set out to create this project in the fall of 2019. We had heard that there were communities that would benefit from an offline version of Stack Overflow and wanted to understand what it would take to create. What we learned was that Kiwix had already done great work on this, and had been distributing Stack Overflow to many users. In fact, it was the second most popular data set in their entire library, behind only Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2018, however, Kiwix was unable to update its offline version of Stack Overflow. Over the last two years, we were able to provide them with financial and technical support to unblock the issues preventing these updates, and to provide resources for improving the usability of the data on their platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over the years demand for Stack Overflow&#8217;s dataset has only continued to grow. With their help we are now able to offer this resource again, and have seen it widely adopted by those coding in situations where there is little to no internet access,” says Stéphane Coillet-Matillon, co-founder of Kiwix. “We built the Sotoki (Stack Overflow to Kiwix) scraper in such a way that it can capture each and every one of the 180 Stack Exchange websites.”</p>



<p>The pandemic prevented us from moving ahead with new deployments, as in-person activity was limited, but we have now reached a point where the work we’ve done with Kiwix can be released to the world and hopefully continue to be improved as an open-source project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Users</strong></p>



<p>Along with Unlocked Labs, groups like <a href="https://thelastmile.org/">The Last Mile</a>, <a href="https://bpi.bard.edu/">Bard Prison Initiative</a>, and <a href="https://code4000.org/">Code 4000</a> have also found that the questions and answers our community has generated, now over 20 million and counting, can be an invaluable resource.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you have a problem you cannot simply go to the internet and search for help,” says Neil Barnby, an instructional officer with Code4000. “This is huge disadvantage for the Code4000 students, but Stack Overflow offline allows them to search the resource for possible solutions. This means they become more independent in finding their own solution and gets them familiar with the resources they will eventually use when they are released. It also means that they can work more efficiently on the commercial work they undertake to develop their portfolios.”</p>



<p>In the world of science, Stack Overflow is used offline in locations like <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/">The IceCube Lab</a>, a remote research station at the South Pole that studies the universe by observing neutrinos.  <strong> </strong></p>



<p>“We constantly work on scripts, a lot of Python code, for instance. We use <a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6/man/script.html">Puppet</a> down there. So every time we need to make a major change on the cluster, there&#8217;s always something that doesn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s when Stack Overflow comes in handy,” says Ralf Auer, the IceCube Data Center Manager. </p>



<p>There are two people onsite year-round to keep the experiments running and there are hundreds of scientists around the world that depend on the data the lab produces. Keeping all the tech running is tough when internet access is spotty to non-existent. “Right now we update once a year during the summer season when I can go down there with a drive. There is no way for us to download 135 gigabytes over the satellite,” says Auer. “Of course it would be nice to get updates more frequently than what we have right now. When I look there and I have a problem with Python, the knowledge on Stack Overflow is just incredible. Just the amount of knowledge that is already out there is very handy for us.”</p>



<p>A third use case for Overflow Offline is for students studying at schools where internet access isn’t consistent, or for those who might not have internet access to help with homework when they are done with class. “Cameroon has a population of 27 million. The Internet coverage rate in Cameroon is 34%, or 9.15 million people have access to the Internet,” says Yannick Nkengne, an ed-tech entrepreneur and founder of the company <a href="https://eduairbox.helloiftech.com/">EduAirBox</a>. “In the education sector, offering free Wi-Fi on university campuses in Cameroon is expensive for administrations. Almost no campuses in Cameroon have free Wi-Fi for students.&nbsp; Students pay for internet packages via their smartphones to connect to their laptops and the price of effective packages for research is expensive for the majority of students. With our solution, students can download content from the EduAirBox to read at home off our network. Their browser uses Web Storage (IndexedDB) technology to store data.”</p>



<p>As a former computer science student, Nkengne is familiar with Stack Overflow. “The fact that Kiwix is able to distribute the Stack Overflow platform was good news for my team because 30% of students in Cameroon are in digital courses and this rate is growing. We are planning to install Stack Overflow in all the networks of our universities. By the end of this year, about 50,000 students will be able to access Stack Overflow without an internet connection.”</p>



<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>



<p>Stack Overflow sees today&#8217;s launch as the jumping off point for Overflow Offline. As we learn from our partners and users, we&#8217;ll endeavor to improve the dataset so that it&#8217;s accessible to more organizations and provides a more powerful resource to those learning to code or building with software.<br>If you want to learn more about how you can support Kiwix and their millions of users without reliable internet access, check out their site <a href="http://support.kiwix.org">here</a>.

<p>When some people hear the phrase “developer velocity,” they cringe and think about delivering an increasingly large number of story points during a sprint. Others push to tighten feedback loops for engineers in order to remove the roadblocks between writing code and getting it into production. But few will understand that much of the “feedback” in that loop is human, so giving them a little more slack lets them provide feedback faster. After all, if you want a fast highway, you should have fewer cars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, Ben and Ryan talk with Matthew Groves, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Couchbase, and Cory House, the founder of Reactjsconsulting.com and a Pluralsight course author, about how to increase velocity without increasing pressure on your engineers, whether cloud native technologies can help (or hurt), and how to design your toolchain so it improves velocity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having trouble with understanding your team’s productivity outside of frameworks and tooling? Create a backlog and work through it: Instant Agile! How much of that backlog you work through is a good baseline measure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Stack Overflow blog recently featured an article from Stack Overflow’s Director of Engineering, Ben Matthews: <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/08/22/does-high-velocity-lead-to-burnout-that-may-be-the-wrong-question-to-ask/">Does high velocity lead to burnout? That may be the wrong question to ask</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the saying goes, ignorance is bliss. But if you work in tech as an engineer, you have the unfortunate perspective of knowing all of the tiny details that have the potential to go wrong. Even when everything is going <em>right</em>, those edge cases can still feel haunting.</p>



<p>In today’s podcast episode, the home team and Jon Chan get together to laugh at themselves as they reflect on their fears of self-driving cars and share horror stories of recruiters promising job offers that turned out to be scam artists.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>Before jumping into driverless car talk, Ben shares a heads up about <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/elpaso/news/press-releases/fbi-warns-cyber-criminals-are-using-fake-job-listings-to-target-applicants-personally-identifiable-information">fake jobs at credible companies</a> that are actually phishing scams meant to steal your identity and hijack your bank accounts. Beware the job offer that seems too good to be true!</p>



<p>Jon, Cassidy, Ceora, Matt, and Ben reflect on <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/whos-afraid-of-driverless-cars/">whether they trust software to operate a vehicle</a>.</p>



<p>Cassidy tells us that she once sat in a car that parked itself and screamed the entire time.</p>



<p>Matt brings us back to reality, reminding us that <a href="https://turbofuture.com/industrial/Automation-in-aircraft-the-changing-role-of-the-pilot">airplane flights have been automated for a while now</a>.</p>



<p>Matt and Ben point out that in the medical technology space, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/robotic-surgery/about/pac-20394974">robotic surgeons</a> are so advanced that they have become more precise than human hands.</p>



<p>Shoutout to lifeboat badge winner <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2579650/gkg4">GKG4</a> for a great answer to the question “how can I check if an array index is out of range?” <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42536752/how-can-i-check-if-an-array-index-is-out-of-range">which has been viewed 67,000 times</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the proliferation of AI technologies like GitHub Copilot for code completion, Stable Diffusion for image generation, and GPT-3 for text, many critics are starting to look at the data that they use to train their AI/ML models. The privacy and ownership issues around these tools are thorny, and the data used to train less prominent AI tools can have equally problematic results. Any model that uses real data has a chance of exposing that data or allowing bad actors to reverse engineer the data through various attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s where synthetic data comes in. Synthetic data is data that is generated via a computer program rather than gathered through real-world events. We reached out to Kalyan Veeramachaneni, principal research scientist at MIT and co-founder of the big data start-up DataCebo, about his project to open-source the power of big data and let machine learning ingest the data it needs to model the real world without real-world privacy issues.</p>



<p>We’ve previously discussed <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/28/gretel-ai-privacy-engineering-synthetic-data/">synthetic data on the podcast</a> in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Answers below have been edited for style and clarity.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Q: </strong>Can you tell us a little bit about synthetic data and what your team is releasing?</em></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>The goal of synthetic data is to represent real-world data accurately enough to be used to train<a href="https://www.unite.ai/what-is-machine-learning/"> artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning</a> models that are themselves used in the real world.</p>



<p>For example, for companies working to develop navigation systems for self-driving cars. It’s not possible to acquire training data that represents every possible driving scenario that could occur. In this case, synthetic data is a useful method to introduce the system to as many different situations as possible.</p>



<p>In September, my team at <a href="https://datacebo.com/">DataCebo</a> released <a href="https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics">SDMetrics 0.7</a>, a set of open-source tools for evaluating the quality of a synthetic database by comparing it to the real database it’s modeled after. SDMetrics can analyze various factors associated with how well the synthetic data represents the original data, from boundary adherence to correlation similarity, as well as the predicted privacy risk. It can also generate reports and visual graphics to make a stronger case for non-engineers about the value of a given synthetic dataset.</p>



<p>Check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDMetrics website</a>&nbsp;to see the different elements of the SDMetrics toolbox.</p>



<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What sort of scenarios does synthetic data protect against?</em></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>Synthetic data has a lot of potential from a privacy perspective. There have been many examples of major privacy issues related to collecting, storing, sharing, and analyzing the data of real people, including instances of researchers and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/netflix-privacy-lawsuit/?utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired27b+%28Blog+-+27B+Stroke+6+%28Threat+Level%29%29&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedburner">hackers</a> alike being able to de-anonymize supposedly anonymous data. These sorts of issues are generally much less likely with synthetic data, since the dataset doesn’t correspond directly to real events or people in the first place.</p>



<p>Real-world data also often has errors and inaccuracies, and can miss edge cases that don’t occur very regularly. Synthetic datasets can be developed to ensure data quality down to a level of detail that includes automatically correcting erroneous labels and filling in missing values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, real-world data can be culturally biased in ways that may impact the algorithms that train on it. Synthetic data approaches can employ statistical definitions of fairness to fix these biases right at the core of the problem: in the data itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Q: </strong>How do you generate synthetic data that looks like real data?</em></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>Synthetic data is created using machine learning methods that include both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches involving neural networks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of data: structured and unstructured. Structured data is generally tabular—that is, the kind of data that can be sorted in a table or spreadsheet. In contrast, unstructured data encompasses a wide range of sources and formats, including images, text, and videos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a range of different methods that have been used to generate different kinds of synthetic data. The type of data needed may impact which methods of generation are best to use. In terms of classical machine learning, the most common approach is to do a Monte Carlo simulation, which generates a variety of outcomes given a specific set of initial parameters. These models usually are designed by experts who know the domain very well for which the synthetic data is being generated. In some cases, it uses physics-based simulation. For example, a computational fluid dynamics based model that can simulate flight patterns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast, deep learning-based methods usually involve either a generative adversarial network (GAN), a variational encoder (VAE), or a neural radiance field (NeRF). These methods are given a subset of real data and they learn a generative model. Once the model is learned, you can generate as much synthetic data as you like. This automated approach makes synthetic data creation a possibility for any type of application. Synthetic data needs to meet certain criteria to be reliable and effective—for example, preserving<a href="https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics/metrics/metrics-glossary/kscomplement"> column shapes</a>,<a href="https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics/metrics/metrics-glossary/categorycoverage"> category coverage</a>, and<a href="https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics/metrics/metrics-glossary/correlationsimilarity"> correlations</a>.&nbsp; To enable this, the processes used to generate the data can be controlled by specifying particular statistical distributions for columns, model architectures and data transformation methods. The choice of which distributions or transformation methods to use is very dependent on the data and use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Q: </strong>What&#8217;s the advantage of using synthetic data vs. mock data?</em></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>Mock data, which is usually hand-crafted and written using rules, simply isn’t practical at the kind of scale that’s useful for most companies that use big data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most data-driven applications require writing software logic that aligns with the correlations seen in data over time—and mock data does not capture these correlations.</p>



<p>For example, imagine that you’re an online retailer who wants to recommend a specific deal for a customer who has, say, bought a TV and made at least seven other transactions. To test whether this logic would work as specified when written in software, you&#8217;d need the data that has those patterns, which could either be real production data or synthetic data that&#8217;s based on real-world data.</p>



<p>There are numerous examples like these where patterns in data are important to test the logic written in the software. Mock data isn’t able to capture that.&nbsp; These days more and more data-based logic is getting added to software applications. Capturing this logic individually via rules has become virtually impossible to do at the kind of scale needed to provide real value to the organizations that use them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We discuss the limits of mock data in more detail <a href="https://datacebo.com/blog/fake-to-synthetic-ml/">on our blog</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Q: </strong>Are there any benefits or concerns with open sourcing this library? Will it be more secure? Can someone reverse engineer real data knowing the models and algorithms?</em></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>DataCebo’s <a href="https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV">Synthetic Data Vault</a> resource includes a number of modeling techniques and algorithms. Making these algorithms public allows for transparency, improved cross-checks from the community,&nbsp; and enhancements to underlying methods to enable more privacy. These algorithms are then applied to data by a data controller in a private setting, to then train a model. One outcome of this approach is that&nbsp; the models themselves are not public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also some privacy-enhancing techniques that are added during the training process. These techniques, while described in the literature, are not part of the open-source library.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing these techniques in of themselves may not lead to reverse engineering, as there is a sufficient amount of randomness involved. It is, however, an interesting question that the community should think about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our new <a href="https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics">SDMetrics</a> release involves evaluation methods for the synthetic data on a variety of axes. These metrics are about quality of synthetic data, efficacy of synthetic data for a specific task, and a few privacy metrics.</p>



<p>We feel that it’s especially important for these metrics to be open-source, as it allows standardization of assessment in the community. The creation of synthetic data—and the synthetic data itself—is ultimately going to be in a “behind the wall” setting. Because of that dynamic, we wanted to create a standard that everyone can refer to when someone references the metric they used to evaluate their (walled-off) data. People can go back to SDMetrics to look at the code underneath the metric, and hopefully have more trust in the metrics being used.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing humanity needs right now, it’s robots. Our oceans need cleaning up, our roads need maintenance, and many restaurants and farms can’t find enough staff. We technologists better get building the benevolent robot custodians that are ultimately going to make our lives better by filling potholes and picking up our trash.</p>



<p>You’ve likely been hearing this same robotics keynote at conferences, promising useful automata that will walk among us, for the last 20 years or so. So how come we don’t see them anywhere in our everyday lives?</p>



<p>Today’s podcast episode explores why the barrier to entry for developers in the robotics industry is so steep. Our guest, Eliot Horowitz, CEO &amp; founder at Viam and former founder and CTO at MongoDB, shares his vision for a future in which it’s just as easy for developers to create robots as it is to craft a smartphone app.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>Despite our <a href="https://thejetsons.fandom.com/wiki/Rosey">long held fantasy</a> about the future of robotics, the technology is still far from mainstream.That’s because the amount of effort needed to get hardware to do useful things at scale is…well…hard.</p>



<p>When Eliot started <a href="https://www.viam.com/">Viam</a>, his goal was to address this challenge by creating software that supports a range of hardware builds out of the box.As the company explains &#8211; “we’re addressing these issues by building a novel robotics platform that relies on standardized building blocks rather than custom code to create, configure and control robots intuitively and quickly. We’re empowering engineers – aspiring and experienced – across industries to solve complicated automation problems with our innovative software tools.” Viam announced the release of its public beta earlier this week.</p>



<p>While Eliot elaborates on his vision for Viam, Ben reflects on his time covering drones for The Verge and working on robotics at DJI.</p>

<h2>SPONSORED BY SUMOLOGIC</h2>



<p>Google&#8217;s most recent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/announcing-dora-2021-accelerate-state-of-devops-report">Accelerate State of DevOps</a> report found that more than 26% of dev teams can be considered “elite performers.” This number is up from 18% in 2018. According to the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics, elite performers deploy software multiple times per day, have a lead time for change and a restore of service in under an hour, and keep their change failure rate under 15%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to low performers, elite performers deploy 973x more frequently, have 6750x faster lead time, and reduce change failure rates by more than 3x. When there is an issue, elite performers are able to recover 6570x faster than low performers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout my career, I’ve had the benefit of working with more than a few elite performers and many who were not. Most organizations fall short not because they are unaware of the best approach, but because they struggle to change their culture or find a formula for success in difficult-to-mature processes. They don&#8217;t always understand their own systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing what traits elite teams tend to have and how those traits impact productivity is important. What the metrics above don’t tell us is how these elite teams are able to achieve these outcomes and what enables a lower-performing team to evolve into an elite one. While it’s nice to know what success looks like, developers and engineering managers want to understand what they can do to upgrade their capabilities.</p>



<p>For those organizations that do upgrade their processes, accelerating innovation relative to their market competition becomes easy to maintain and even accelerate. Successful organizations today build highly observable systems and use that observability in the development process to improve their overall velocity. Think test-driven development on steroids.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll offer some insights into what I believe are the <em>most important</em> building blocks in becoming an elite performer.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 id="h-process-capability-the-secret-of-elite-performers">Process capability: The secret of elite performers</h1>



<p>Early in my IT career I was an instructor and consultant implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration">CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)</a>. In one of my classes, I had a rather eccentric engineer who would challenge me to defend my reasoning on nearly every topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wanted to have him thrown out of my class but decided instead to let him co-instruct and share his experiences with the class. That judgment call made the course one of my most memorable and fostered a friendship I consider still one of the most influential of my career. We spent many hours debating (both at and after work) and the knowledge he shared with me has had an immeasurable impact over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the last day of the course, he brought me a copy of the <em>Standard Handbook of Industrial Automation</em>. In the 1986 edition of the book, he highlighted one phrase, “Measuring Process Capability,” and added a handwritten note that said, “This is all you’ll ever need to know.” I can say with confidence that this statement has held true over the past 30 years.</p>



<p>Elite performers have a strong culture in process engineering. Process engineering covers the design and implementation of processes that turn raw materials—in this case, customer needs and software engineering capabilities—into business products. Elite performers are great at defining, measuring, and improving processes. Each of these is important to the process: good design and good specifications define what the application should look like in production; metrics, monitoring, and now observability let you measure how your actual application compares to the design; and harnessing that feedback allows you to design new features or refactor code to improve the application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a single metric you can use to measure how well your process matches your design. <a href="https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section1/pmc16.htm"><em>Process capability</em></a> is a measure of the variability between customer requirements laid out in the design docs (the voice of the customer) and the actual performance of the process (the voice of the process). It can be expressed as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="264" height="39" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png" alt="Cp = Specification width / Process width = USL - LSL / 6 standard deviations" class="wp-image-20889"/></figure>



<p><strong>Specification width</strong> is the difference between the upper (<strong>USL</strong>) and lower bounds (<strong>LSL</strong>) of a process metric as defined in the specifications. The <strong>process width</strong> is that same differential except in production processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So then, for any metric, we’re defining the upper and lower specification limits and evaluating how often those metrics violate the limits. Does this sound familiar? It should. Take a look at any SRE’s service-level indicators (SLIs) and objectives and you will find the idea of error budgets and burndown are rooted in Cp. Also, because this process is focused on improving the quality and efficiency of our processes, it means we ought to be thinking about the quality of our data and the size of our sample sets.</p>



<p>We can look to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>—the basis of modern observability—for help in engineering our processes and for guiding good coding practices to support those processes. The metrics that we are measuring in Cp are evaluated based their consistency, or how well they remain within a defined performance corridor (the range of acceptable values). For a microservice architecture, for example, we would want the <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/">golden signals </a>to be predictable within our performance corridor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NmSYHFgWETEi3O-znroA3GfuL7ADzsr5eIif1-R2RNsoSDGwRMcVk1bPgm6Zo4HhdC9XLOExxVcS1QL1XfLOaFQj2po67V0BE8ZlGj4veSgYFtKfY9TNAHiz6vt3YMt_I0AqdBruXNW65Jb50YmzvY9bCrgXGbyfZgfyM_-iQ5zwzjSy78X6Zb0hew" alt="Graph of a metric series represented by a Lower and Upper specification limit"/><figcaption>Fig 1. Example of a metric series represented by a Lower and Upper specification limit</figcaption></figure>



<p>We want API response times to relate to customer experience (CX). If response times are all over the place, or we make it hard to discern why a call is slow vs. fast, it’s impossible to know if CX is good or bad. So it’s vital that we avoid lazy coding such as <code>getAll()</code> type statements, which flood calls with unpredictably large amounts of data. Instead, we might leverage pagination to control our results set, and in doing so, we create a predictable API. If we find we are making too many calls, we may pre-fetch more data asynchronously or elect to change the UI so we queue heavy requests and return them once processed. Ask yourself next time you’re designing a service these questions:</p>



<ul><li>What is the response time required to ensure good user experience? Perhaps APIs must respond in less than 250ms or not to exceed 500ms.</li><li>What upstream or downstream dependencies could derail performance? Can we overcome them?</li><li>How will we design the code to exhibit deterministic behavior? Are there standards or patterns we can use?&nbsp;</li><li>Can we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern">circuit-breakers</a> or other design patterns discussed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5013255/which-design-patterns-improve-performance">here on Stack Overflow</a> to improve performance or handle failure states without impacting performance so much that we end up doing more harm than good?&nbsp;</li><li>What attributes on API calls will we use to derive metrics in order to ensure we analyze and bucket the things we track like-for-like? Things like separating <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code> operations and understanding which attributes are responsible for requests taking one code path vs. another through our services (and capturing them).</li></ul>



<p><em>Note: The higher the cardinality on telemetry the better. The more attributes we use to understand performance, the easier it is to understand the source of deviation related to a change when it occurs thereby increasing Cp.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deterministic code exhibits predictable response times for a given load. Well-written services will exhibit a consistent response profile over time and as load increases. If the load increases beyond the breaking point, we will likely see a spike in errors right around the time we see response times hockey-stick as dead-locks and other thread contention problems.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jPye2htCouYbcWqrQr3ChXUeO5vSHOVsUmhnIGnmzBjjHPwrjNl4GIf3Di1wLD6dfj-TajYKOzhx_dCMIq7ZRpNRj-3c1xBippsULtXDVyrJXOgtKz0QX6sSuEeKxHuE2ysBpBTbUY14et5F9AZHNNkX8HegkYOu3oeyHzCM4gZuyb1uclMb-D5RFQ" alt="Graph demonstrating a hockey-stick pattern of response time as load increases" height="800"/><figcaption>Fig 2. Example of a hockey-stick pattern of response time as load increases</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The smoother and more consistent the metric over time, up to the breaking point equates to high Cp <strong><em>provided</em></strong> you can readily discern the cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing that a process will reliably produce metric values that fall within a narrow corridor (ideally not more than two or three standard deviations between the LSL and USL) helps us plan for the outcomes that we want and will aid in better automated remediations (via AIOps and MLOps). Everything we do related to building, testing, and shipping software, over time, should improve Cp, reliability and our ability to predict outcomes. If you find yourself with a great deal of technical debt, or you&#8217;re on a team that has had to declare bankruptcy on new feature requests, the best way to combat this and get out of debt is to focus on improving your process capability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To improve process capability, you will want to tighten the feedback loop in your software development lifecycle. This means <strong><em>knowing</em></strong> the voice of your customer and being able to <strong><em>consistently measure</em></strong> the voice of the process(es).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a list of things you can start doing today that will help you focus your efforts in digging yourself out of debt. If you’re not deep in debt, these are good preventative measures to help you avoid deep technical debt long-term.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Break your services often</strong>. Understanding the failure states of your services is vital to knowing where you need to optimize code and infrastructure. I’ve seen customers improve the efficiency of their services by 300x or more simply by breaking their services. Know your peak throughput in transactions per second <em>and</em> per node. Understand scaling factors when the cluster has many nodes (or pods). Can you optimize code to reduce time on CPU? Are there threading issues, singleton issues, or class-loading issues causing thread wait? Are you async everywhere you could be?</li><li><strong>Publish mocks for the APIs you write</strong>. Get your downstream producers to do the same. Simulate failure states like slow response or no response with mocks vs. relying on systems downstream. You’ll find you don’t need a robust environment to break your services or expose many problems very early on in doing this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Soak your services</strong>. Leverage break-testing to find the break-point in throughput, then back off 20%.&nbsp; Run this load for extended periods on a periodic basis. Do things stay reliable over a period of soak-testing?&nbsp; Find the failures and resolve them.</li><li><strong>Identify your canaries</strong>. Use this time to define the few key metrics that will with accuracy infer the health of the service, what will their upper and lower specification limits be? What will be the runbook for when they are outside their limits?</li><li><strong>Automate break-testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.</strong> Continuously battle test your code.</li><li><strong>Use your peak throughput to set a limit on the number of sessions</strong>. Scale out before you reach these thresholds. If scaling out fails, is it not better to tell a user your too busy to service their request than to offer them a degraded experience?</li><li><strong>Chaos engineer your end-to-end stacks</strong>. What if x happens? Form several hypothesis as a team and throw $5 in a pot to the winner. Be creative, find the weaknesses and fix them. Improve the game theory in how you run your stacks and celebrate findings.</li><li><strong>Eliminate work queues.</strong> Look for where you have latency in relying on other teams, reorganize, go to crews/squads models—do what you must to be as self-service as possible. Analyze your processes, define your measurements, and set OKRs to improve them over time.</li><li><strong>Track the time it takes to make decisions</strong>. Does it take several weeks to decide something? Once decisions are funded, how often are they scrapped or deprioritized?&nbsp; Are these metrics being consistently measured?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Find repetitive manual tasks, then automate them</strong>. Reduce churn and toil every where it exists.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Measure to the right number of 9s (e.g. 99.99%) for your services and start using error budgets. In other words, don&#8217;t rely on averages. Instead, leverage top percentiles (TP), histograms, and the number of times things fall outside the median distribution and specification limits. Turn these into budgets, so when your error budget is healthy, you&#8217;re good to continue or even accelerate change to production. If your budgets are falling or below acceptable, it’s time to slow down and focus on stabilizing and reducing risk.&nbsp; Refactor code as needed to reduce the outliers and improve predictability.</p>



<p>There’s a great project on Github called <a href="https://openslo.com/">OpenSLO</a> that enables you to declare your <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli">service-level indicators</a> (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs) as code by generating the rules using <a href="https://github.com/OpenSLO/slogen">SLOGen</a>. Doing this enables you to leverage Terraform to deploy SLIs and SLOs and generate the dashboards, metric rules, and alert thresholds as part of your deploy. Sumo Logic recently <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/blog/how-to-drive-better-decision-making-with-reliability-management/">released full integration</a> with OpenSLO and enables customers to automate and keep consistent service-level management for their services. In this way, deploying reliability management for your services can become fully automated so they stay consistent, putting you on the path to becoming elite performers.</p>



<h1 id="h-building-observable-systems-and-what-to-avoid">Building observable systems (and what to avoid)</h1>



<p>One thing elite performers do seemingly well is create tight process feedback loops using observability techniques and tools. They excel at building and operating highly observable systems. I use “systems” here quite loosely. In this context, I am referring not only to the services that get deployed, but also to the CI/CD pipelines, telemetry pipelines, and control planes for automation. Moreover, building observable systems includes observing the processes that govern software delivery and the standards these processes employ. In summary, elite performers are able to measure things in <strong>concise</strong>, <strong>reliable</strong>, and <strong>predictable </strong>ways across the software development lifecycle. They approach observability with intention using the least number of metrics or data points (<strong>concise</strong>), generated from consistent and high-quality data (<strong>reliable</strong>) that best represent process health and provide strong correlation to issues (<strong>predictable</strong>).</p>



<p>To have the most flexibility in building observable systems, when selecting toolchains, telemetry agents, telemetry pipelines, or control planes look for components that fully embrace and support open-standards. Open source and CNCF toolchains are great at being natively interoperable. Keep in mind that some vendors listed on CNCF fall into a gray area of supporting open standards but with proprietary closed-source code such as their agents that collect telemetry. Consider carefully before selecting a proprietary vendor and see if there are open-source solutions that will meet your requirements. Vendor supplied agents that are not open-sourced generally produce proprietary datasets that can only be read by the vendor’s backend platform, making their integrations exclusive. This is far from ideal as they keep teams vendor-locked around exclusive data that is difficult or much more expensive to democratize across the larger organization. Proprietary components in observability have historically resulted in IT having many disparate silos of data, limiting the effectiveness of entity modeling, machine learning, and the overall digital transformation of the enterprise. To become an elite performer, organizations should do everything they can to own their telemetry at the source, not lease it in the form of proprietary vendor code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By leveraging an open standard like <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</a>, you never have to worry about a vendor changing their licensing model in such a way as to severely impact data democratization as one APM vendor recently did by going back to per-user licensing. Your choices are to either pay them more to access your data or you ditch their technology, and in doing so, reset the clock on maturity along with any instrumentation and automation built against their platform. This is why elite performers opt to leverage OpenTelemetry and work with vendors like Sumo Logic that embrace opt-in vs lock-in for analysis. Seek out vendors that fully support open standards and toolchains rather than continuing to invest in or rely on a closed/proprietary agent or ecosystem for collecting your telemetry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another reason for OpenTelemetry’s success is that it’s a highly opinionated, open-source schema that does not have an opinion on how data is stored, aggregated, or processed. It simplifies/standardizes telemetry acquisition, unifies all logs, metrics, traces, and events into a new type of composite (and highly enriched) telemetry stream and enables sophisticated processing and transformations to occur in the collector pipeline. These capabilities combine to solve many data challenges in IT and especially within business intelligence teams that have historically struggled to access immutable real-time data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Development teams adopting OpenTelemetry benefit the most by having a lightweight API and swappable SDK architecture, which means they are no longer reliant on a closed agent with technical debt outside of their control. If there is a bug or feature needed in OpenTelemetry, it can be fixed or written by the developer or anyone in the industry vs. waiting and relying on a small team of the vendor’s engineers. This was especially beneficial when <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/19/heres-how-stack-overflow-users-responded-to-log4shell-the-log4j-vulnerability-affecting-almost-everyone/">the recent Log4J vulnerability</a> was announced and resulted in massive disruption of every proprietary agent deployment. For OpenTelemetry, it was virtually painless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional application performance monitoring (APM) and observability tools are built on two or three pillars of data sources: traces and metrics mainly, with limited logging in many cases. Great teams instrument their systems to emit all three types into a unified platform of data to be the most observable. While traditional APM vendors have argued that you could eliminate one of the sources or rely heavily on one, all three have their role in creating observable systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For all the benefits of legacy APM, a&nbsp; major shortcoming was that it enabled teams to capture literally everything without thinking through what was important—mainly because it did not rely on developer input. Too much data without regard for its purpose leads to massive inefficiency. Building your systems with the intention of reliably inferring the internal state by the most efficient output possible produces telemetry that is deeply correlated with the enrichment necessary in metadata to satisfy the design outcomes. This leads to an optimized state where we can leverage fewer metrics in larger Cartesian sets to drive SLIs and operate more effectively by SLO and burndown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OpenTelemetry lets you gather data from four sources: logs, metrics, traces, and Span events.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Logs</strong>, at their simplest, are a timestamped message and audit trail appended to a text file or database. For decades, APM vendors played down the need for logs, claiming there was more value in their proprietary traces. The argument was that traces would capture the exception logs and it was easier to diagnose a trace in conjunction with a user session than analyze a bunch of logs. The reality is we need both raw logs and traces. Today, more than ever with the explosion of components, stack complexity, change rates, and increasing attack surfaces, proprietary agents are at a disadvantage especially if their platforms are not robust at log aggregation. Unifying all telemetry means easily jumping from metrics to associated traces and logs, or vice-versa. Logs are critical to audit and compliance and in understanding the root cause through the sequence of things. What if something happens elsewhere that affects a set of traces indirectly? You still need the benefits of a full query language and search engine for logs to effectively determine root cause in many cases. In contrast to OpenTelemetry, proprietary tracing tools are limited by their proprietary data models, back-end platforms, and the simple fact that most don’t do logging well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Metrics </strong>are aggregated time-series data about a system. Properly implemented, they are the canary in the coal mine: the most reliable method of detecting deviations that can then correlated with ML to both logs and traces in a temporal context and across the dimensions of available metadata. Metrics are great, but they are most useful when they are correlated to logs and traces in a unified way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where logs capture a moment in a system, <strong>traces </strong>follow a request through all of the components and moments. As metrics aggregate data emitted by a system, traces via OpenTelemetry tag the logs with trace and span IDs throughout the system making it simple to search and return a sequentially ordered set of logs from a trace ID. Traces also expose the actual code path, which is great for following the dependency chain and uncovering bottlenecks or other more exotic issues along the code path. I still run across IT leaders who don’t see the value of traces, and it amazes me every time. Traces are invaluable as they flatten the complexity of log analysis in deep systems by connecting all the logs emitted on that trace into the order they were emitted, which means log analysis remains linear vs. becoming exponential with the growth in complexity and expansion of cloud applications.</p>



<p>OpenTelemerty also adds a fourth data source: <strong>Span events</strong>. In essence, this is the equivalent of enabling deep code visibility to the span, such as stack traces or other events as defined by the framework or developer. There are a few projects now that are looking to go one step further and provide all the attributes in the objects on heap in the call tree as part of the stack trace when an exception is thrown. This will simplify the challenges of getting to the the root cause of those hard-to-analyze null pointer exceptions that never seem to show up in testing, but plague us in production.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with OpenTelemetry, I highly recommend becoming familiar with it and getting involved with the working groups, even contributing to the source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams that successfully develop observable systems exhibit the following:</p>



<ul><li>DevSecOps and business analysis are intelligent, continuous, immutable, and real-time; data is unified and democratized</li><li>Common instrumentation libraries are used across the organization; metadata is consistent and declarative&nbsp;</li><li>Control plane and telemetry pipelines are consistent and declarative</li><li>Observability is cleanly annotated and instrumentation is done with domain/aspect-oriented programming</li><li>Metrics for monitoring health/performance are declarative&nbsp;</li><li>Dashboards, alerts, and alert thresholds are declarative and deployed with each merge</li><li>A control plane evaluates outputs against rules, and validates canaries, scales up/down, rolls back intelligently, handles level-0 auto-remediation well</li></ul>



<p>I find that elite performers are mature in a lot of DevOps and DevSecOps subareas, like <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops#:~:text=GitOps%20uses%20Git%20repositories%20as,set%20for%20the%20application%20framework.">GitOps </a>and <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/">Zero Trust</a>. Interestingly, I am also seeing <a href="https://www.plutora.com/blog/value-stream-management">value stream management</a> (VSM) and <a href="https://flowframework.org/flow-metrics/">flow metrics</a> emerging as a new framework for APM and as a way to express a more focused dimension of reliability for the business. If your software system is performing perfectly, but your customers aren’t happy, the process isn’t producing the desired outcome. Mapping out and observing your value streams is a good way of focusing efforts.</p>



<p>Ultimately, becoming an elite Performer means becoming obsessed with high data quality and leveraging MLOps more effectively. Having all this data in one place (ideally), allows ML to function more effectively and correlate more signals by exposing the relationships across these high-cardinality datasets. The more effective and reliable your analytics are at inference and dimensional analysis, the greater the impact on the speed at which you can recover from failure. When building observable systems, emphasize <strong><em>what</em></strong> data is collected, <strong><em>how</em></strong><strong> </strong>data is collected, and <strong><em>why</em></strong> data is collected so you can deliver high value information and knowledge to IT and business stakeholders.</p>



<h1 id="h-observability-driven-development">Observability-driven development</h1>



<p>I chose to write this section last because everything we’ve discussed up to this point is in one way or another a key element to the fundamentals of observability-driven development (ODD). ODD is a shift left of everything related to observability to the earliest stages of development. Much like test-driven development emphasizes writing test cases before writing code to improve quality and design, ODD does the same for building observable systems: developers write code with the intention of declaring the outputs and specification limits required to infer the internal state of the system and process, both at a component level and as a whole system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ODD in practice can also become the forcing function needed for the organization looking to standardize instrumentation frameworks, SDKs, and APIs used to build observability or to standardize on how structured logging, metrics, traces, and events are implemented to ultimately fulfill the needs of the many stakeholders that need this data. With ODD, the principals of observability discussed herein are woven into the fabric of the system with both intention and precision.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9j89v8P5vv9FtmDqDE9YtqoZcuQQZpl2bEIf-4oIyG6OdfVYhx6Dkm5xgDjY3i2Q4bdiF2vcWdClu0D7dAiMbfVMy_3NrECiafn8BpusRAhMoH7lwxVNMDKJo8ENKQKUCNcigYEdg3APkZaAhQPL33A56_99YZ0z8TAO-qoxHWENNrkka7WY9VZc3Q" alt="Comparing test driven development to observability driven development. Define expected outcome then Measure the Outcome then Change feature and keep measuring then repeat. "/><figcaption><strong><em>Fig. 3 Expanding TDD with ODD</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Where TDD created a feedback loop between the test and design, ODD expands the feedback loops ensuring features behave as expected, improving deployment processes and providing the feedback to planning.</p>



<p>I like to think of ODD as a bridge across what has historically been a very deep chasm that has diminished the developers’ relationship to production. ODD is all about giving the developer (and the business) the tools (and processes) necessary to build a tight and cohesive relationship with the production environment. In the process of doing this, everyone wins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of ODD, however, is to achieve a level of process capability that allows you to go straight from development to production. Testing in production has numerous benefits for the developer:</p>



<ul><li>The business, product managers, and developers can iterate more quickly through hypotheses.&nbsp;</li><li>Data produced is of the highest quality when compared to non-production environments, where data is often either fake, scrubbed, or lacks good representation to production.&nbsp;</li><li>DevOps teams improve their ability to automate, fail forward, feature switch, and roll back.&nbsp;</li><li>Production testing will expose any processes that are not yet capable.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>I recently interviewed an SRE for a boutique retailer that maintained normal operations throughout the peak retail season of 2021. The only thing they opted out of was their normal cycle of chaos engineering. Most teams that support retail operations opt out of a lot of their more onerous programs during the peak season. How did they accomplish this?</p>



<ul><li>Their engineering teams are free to push code to the production environments, provided their merge requests pass all the checks.&nbsp;</li><li>Services are written with mocks that can be used by other teams so various failure modes can be tested on a dev’s laptop for downstream dependencies.&nbsp;</li><li>They automate their performance tests of code in the pipeline (using compute budget that used to be earmarked for staging and lower environments).&nbsp;</li><li>Those performance tests do many things, but perhaps most importantly they break their services over and over, looking for statistically relevant signals (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma">six sigma</a>) in deviations while evaluating throughput and saturation against response times for new features which input to their SLOs.&nbsp;</li><li>They completely destroy and rebuild their Kubernetes clusters each week, not because they have to, but because it keeps them reliable and confident in their capability of process in recovery.&nbsp;</li><li>They leverage logs and metrics for all of their automation needs and leverage traces for optimizing customer experience and for rapid fault domain isolation of issues.&nbsp;</li><li>All their data is tagged to the feature level.&nbsp;</li><li>If their SLO budgets fall below the level of acceptable, new feature releases are restricted and change is limited to restoring service levels.&nbsp;</li><li>They manage to the law of nines and rely on percentiles and exponential histograms for evaluating performance data.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In short, their journey into observability-driven development enabled them to fix many processes along the way to ultimately enable them to go from laptop and IDE directly to production with code. Their engineers have few dependencies on other teams that delay them, and their pipelines are robust and do a good job of certifying new code before merging to production, which they now do hundreds of times per day. By tracking numerous dimensions across their datasets they are able to expose outliers and understand behavior and performance characteristics over time with deep understanding. This high fidelity enables them to spot regression quickly and recover normal operations in well under an hour.&nbsp; Observability-driven development has enabled them to become elite performers.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on observability driven development? &nbsp; Do you think you’re ready to to take your code testing to production?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, engineers stay about half as long at their companies as the average worker in other industries. The reason? The force is on our side as tech workers. Our skills are high in demand, and we’re compensated well for the brainpower that we bring to the table. Plus, tech is evolving so fast, you need to keep learning in new environments.</p>



<p>The thing is, there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it. Admittedly, it looks a little weird to be upgrading jobs every 3 months. But switching things up every 12-18 is understandable. Employers want to see someone who is leveling up and making major contributions, not tenure. In today’s podcast episode, the home team (Ben, Cassidy, Ceora, and Matt) gets together to discuss career advantages, LinkedIn A/B tests, and why gen Z is doomed when it comes to tech.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>Ceora and Cassidy talk about why engineers are so good at job hopping — and why it can pay off to upgrade roles every year or two.</p>



<p>Ceora speaks openly about the privileges of working in tech compared to other industries.</p>



<p>Apparently, in some places, it’s a thing for engineers to leave their teams and then rejoin the organization with a promotion to get ahead. Who do you know that does the boomerang?</p>



<p>Cassidy’s husband’s favorite interview question to ask: “If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this company, what would you change?”</p>



<p>Ben poses a question about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/business/linkedin-social-experiments.html">whether LinkedIn AB tests</a> are disadvantageous to some career seekers over others.</p>



<p>Matt introduces us to the world of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/make-your-very-own-ai-generated-pokemon-like-creature/">AI generated Pokémon</a>.</p>



<p>Ceora, our resident voice of Gen Z, tells us why she thinks millennials are the only true generation to understand tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In order to encourage people to contribute to this great knowledge building experiment, Stack Overflow built a point system—reputation—into its early design. Now, over a decade later, five contributors have cracked the million-reputation mark on Stack Overflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/6309/vonc">VonC</a> found out he had passed this storied mark, did he celebrate? Was it meaningful?</p>



<p>“I think it was meaningful to me mum,” he quipped, slipping a faux-British accent on top of his natural French one. “It was absolutely a non-event for me.”</p>



<p>The rest of us, however, are pretty impressed by his score. So how did one of the newest millionaires stack up this impressive total? His explanation is a humble one: he wanted to learn more about technologies and be of service to people who might not have the same access as he does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We spoke with VonC about the early days on Stack Overflow, what drives him to answer several questions every single day, and what we can all do to better serve the one hundred million visitors who come to Stack Overflow each month.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-the-stack-overflow-beta-users">The last of the Stack Overflow Beta users</h2>



<p>When VonC first got into computer programming, he would search for answers to his coding questions on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> forums. By the time he found Stack Overflow, he’d been in the software industry for over ten years. That was back during the Beta period—in fact, VonC might be one of the last folks to get a Beta badge, posting his first question on September 14, 2008, two days before the Beta period ended and the Beta badges <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/30/beta">were handed out</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like a lot of new users, VonC had trouble with his first <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/61648/timeline?filter=WithVoteSummaries">answer</a>. He put together a question and tried to provide as much context as possible, but it was promptly downvoted without him knowing why. His <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/61648/timeline?filter=WithVoteSummaries">initial reputation started at -1</a> and remained that way for years until <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2012/03/06/reputation-and-historical-archives/">we refactored how reputation was managed</a> in our database. Then his initial reputation was set back to 1, just like everyone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stack Overflow was vastly different in those early days. This was the time before comments; you could only post answers to questions, not provide feedback or request more information. “I remember vividly that the culture of the site was very much in flux and in definition then,” said VonC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early participants could garner a lot of upvotes through open-ended questions, things like “<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/113121/best-tail-log-file-visualization-freeware-tool">What’s the best freeware log file visualization tool?</a>” (<em>Ed note: Viewing this link requires 10k reputation as it has been deleted</em>) Today, these questions would be closed, but back then, open questions with debatable, subjective answers were all the rage. VonC even earned his first <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges?tab=general&amp;filter=gold">gold badge</a> (and second) for answers to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/238177/worst-ui-youve-ever-used/238186#238186">one</a> of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/238177/worst-ui-youve-ever-used/238191#238191">these</a> questions (<em>Ed. note: Also deleted, so earn that rep to view them</em>). But once the community decided on what was <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/">too subjective for Stack Overflow</a>, the definition of a good question solidified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, VonC’s path to a million reputation is paved with very few questions: slightly more than twenty (some have been deleted since). Instead, he was learning about new software and gaining mastery by <em>answering</em> questions. “I was using Stack Overflow to introduce myself to new technical topics, mainly Git and the Go language, plus Docker and Kubernetes,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time, he was managing terabytes of data on a very large version control system in IBM Rational ClearCase, software initially released in 1984. He came across questions about Git and Mercurial, version control systems that were distributed, which ClearCase is not. The first Git question he came across was about cloning the full repository locally to enable access to the full history without querying a server. “I was actually laughing at that notion because it was completely strange to me to clone the full history,” said VonC. “But actually, it is how we are working nowadays.”</p>



<p>To learn more about Git, he dove into answering questions. For the first few, he didn’t even install Git; instead, he compared the documentation to the question and wrote answers based on his understanding of the docs. When that answer got accepted, it told him that there might be something to this Git: it’s intuitive enough for him to answer questions accurately without using the software and works as the documentation would have you expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VonC took the same approach when evaluating Scala. He’d check out the new Scala questions, compare them to the available documentation, and write answers. After a little more than <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:6309+[scala]">200 answers</a>, he decided that Scala wasn’t for him: “I understood it well enough to realize that it was not a good match for me and my skills.”</p>



<h2 id="h-motivated-to-serve">Motivated to serve</h2>



<p>For the first few years, VonC used Stack Overflow to learn new technologies. He couldn’t get the hang of properly asking questions, but he still wanted to learn more about the tools and languages he used. It required a mindset shift—answering questions as a way to learn—but he found it very effective. For folks looking to use his method, he recommends trying to get the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/17/necromancer">Necromancer</a> badge by creating excellent <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52986809/how-to-configure-options-for-the-version-controls-git-commit-command/63965747#63965747">answers</a> on old questions. This includes answers to older questions where there are new solutions due to features being added to software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over time, though, another motivation emerged: to help the community. VonC answers several questions every day. After years of this, it’s no surprise that he can’t think of a favorite question. Instead, his favorites are those that may not have a high view count, but have helped someone who doesn’t have the same access to technical expertise where they live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Before Stack Overflow, I was looking for expertise in order to help me in my career,” said VonC. “What Stack Overflow provides you is the ability and the opportunity to interact and access the knowledge of so many specialists. My mindset has shifted where not knowing something is no longer a fear for me. Not knowing is my basic state, but for questions from students around the world, I will go deep in on a topic and I will find out for them.”</p>



<p>That spirit of service comes from his background as an IT support specialist. In his work calls, he tries to establish a rapport: who are you, what’s not working, what do I know that might help? On Stack Overflow, his instinct is to provide the same help to people struggling to ask good questions. Where many may just vote to close and delete, VonC tries to jump into a chat with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that he’s built up some expertise in Git and other topics, he freely admits that his activity on Stack Overflow helps his career. He’s a contractor, so the company in charge of finding him work can offer him as an expert and point to his activity on the site as proof. “One of my motivations to answer questions every day on Stack Overflow was to have a complement to my resume to showcase,” he said. “‘One million reputation’ isn’t completely meaningful because they don&#8217;t know exactly what that means. But I say I&#8217;ve answered tens of thousands of questions around version control systems, and they understand.”</p>



<h2 id="h-privileges-for-millionaires">Privileges for millionaires</h2>



<p>As someone who has been around Stack Overflow since it left Beta, VonC seemed like a good person to ask about the changes he’d make to the site if he were suddenly elevated to benevolent dictator for life. No surprise—his suggestion was about the experience of asking questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His first answer was promptly downvoted without comment, and that experience has stuck with him. In his own practice, instead of immediately downvoting and voting to close, VonC invites the question asker to a chat to try to clarify their question. But users below 20 reputation can’t use the chat function, so he can’t give them feedback. These are the users most likely to be scared off by harsh initial experiences. “Users with one million—sorry, [puts finger to lip à la Austin Powers] one <em>million </em>reputation—should be able to invite any users to chat,” he suggests. Of course, one million rep might be a bit too high of a bar, but the suggestion stands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VonC concedes that the speed of closing subpar questions has made the site very healthy in terms of content quality. “Any content that is not exactly like the community wants is very quickly removed—not just closed, but completely removed,” he said. “In that aspect, it’s healthy. In terms of dialogue, that’s where it is a bit dodgy because of issues between the new users and long-time users.”</p>



<p>We’ve definitely heard these comments before, so we created the <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/416428/introducing-the-staging-ground-an-attempt-at-improving-the-first-time-asker-exp">Staging Ground</a>, where new users can learn how to best ask questions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-come-for-the-expertise-stay-for-the-community">Come for the expertise, stay for the community</h2>



<p>VonC has been around the site so long that he’s starting to recognize other members by their answers. He notes one user who operates in the Git and version control space with him who will drop a thoroughly researched answer days after the question was asked, complete with footnotes. “Sometimes the footnotes have footnotes, that’s the kind of depth that this user brings to their answers. It’s clearly not somebody who will be the <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9731/fastest-gun-in-the-west-problem">fastest gun in the west</a>.” It’s the kind of answer that makes Stack Overflow Q&amp;A pages valuable to thousands of knowledge-seekers years after the initial asker has solved their problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But VonC has never seen his own participation as a way to show off. Obviously, he’s leaving a record of his knowledge for all to see, but he remains motivated by the urge to help others. VonC hopes to be of even greater service to the community in the future. The reputation points and credibility are nice, but he hopes to be able to give greater rewards to high performers, especially those in working with technological deficits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, VonC’s million-rep total shows that one of the best ways to thrive is to be of service to your community. And as the platform for that community, we&#8217;re always trying to learn and grow from our members so we can fulfill our vision of being the most valuable destination for the world&#8217;s current and next generation of technologists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 28th, hundreds of technology leaders gathered in New York City’s Financial District for our first conference, Flow State. There they experienced eight sessions from tech leaders at Salesforce, Udemy, Indeed, Esty, and Capgemini. We covered the future of work and the changing landscapes of the developer experience, recruiting, collaboration, and workplace learning. The crowd on site was joined by almost 5,000 virtual attendees who registered from 83 countries around the globe.</p>



<p>Our CEO, Prashanth Chandrasekar, kicked things off with a discussion on the state of work and the factors that are key to a developer’s learning journey and success on the job. Drawing on data from our most recent <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/">developer survey</a>, he laid out a positive vision for a future of hybrid work and online learning.</p>

<p>Next up was our <strong>CTO, Jody Bailey, chatting with Chris Kohr, a VP of Engineering at Salesforce</strong>. Nearly 70% of developers say they encounter a knowledge silo at least once a week, and 62% spend more than 30 minutes a day searching for answers or solutions to problems. For a team of 50 developers, the amount of time spent searching for critical information adds up to between 333-651 hours of time lost per week across the entire team.</p>



<p>The pair discussed strategies for helping developers avoid knowledge silos and context switching and explored some of the keys to getting into a flow state that maximizes both productivity and happiness.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The final morning session was a fireside chat between our <strong>Chief Marketing Officer, Khalid El Khatib, and the journalist and author, Clive Thompson</strong>, whose book, <em>Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and Remaking of the World</em>, is a rich ethnographic study of the programmers who help craft our modern society. The pair had the audience in rapt attention with plenty of laughs as they explored what it takes to be a self-taught developer in today’s tech industry.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In the afternoon, <strong>Seth Hodgson, VP of Engineering at Udemy</strong>, talked about how to approach skills acquisition as a daily habit. As the demands of the workplace change and organizations shift to keep pace and continue to innovate, their workforce requires constant reskilling. In fact, 87% of leaders say they expect to face major skills gaps over the next five years. He discusses an approach that enables real-time, hands-on practice and peer-driven knowledge sharing, which has enabled Udemy’s 54M learners and 12.5K enterprise partners to always be at their best.</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Stack Overflow CTO Jody Bailey</strong> held a fireside chat with <strong>Alex Bulat-van den Wildenberg, Group Technology Director and CTO at Capgemini</strong>, discussed how scaling subject matter experts and uncovering domain expertise can ultimately drive team and product growth.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After a short break, <strong>Stack Overflow Chief Product Officer Teresa Dietrich</strong> shared how Stack Overflow builds for the technologist’s holistic learning journey and what updates to expect across all of our products: Stack Overflow for Teams, Collectives<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Employer Branding, and Advertising.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Following Teresa, <strong>Stack Overflow Chief Marketing Officer Khalid El Khatib spoke with Maggie Hulce, Executive VP, GM of Enterprise at Indeed, and Sally Bolig, Global Head of Employer Branding at Etsy</strong> about the ultra-competitive talent market today and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/10/the-great-resignation-is-here-what-does-that-mean-for-developers/">the Great Resignation</a> still reshaping our workplaces.  How do you attract talent, retain team members, and scale your expertise across your growing team? They discussed how this talent war stands independent from economic trends, the importance of understanding developer workflows in today’s talent climate, and how tools, onboarding, learning, and collaboration will all impact the talent market indefinitely.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Finally, <strong>Human-Computer Interaction researcher <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/Home_page/Welcome.html">Dr. Gloria Mark</a></strong> delivered the closing keynote speech. While we’re unable to embed her talk, look for her new book <em>Attention Span: Finding Focus and Fighting Distraction</em> out in January 2023.</p>



<p>What comes next?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was our inaugural customer conference, and we had the privilege of getting to interact with employees who lead their internal communities on Stack Overflow for Teams. We were also thrilled that many members of our Stack Overflow community attended. We met folks who had started Stack Exchanges and other who had been asking and answering questions on our platform for over a decade. Given the success of this conference, you can look forward to future Flow State events next year.</p>

<p>Yep, we know a bunch of you are thinking, “nope, no C-suite for me today.” Managing people dynamics? Doing things other than coding? Being responsible for a P&amp;L, accountable to a board, and managing headcount? Before you stop reading, consider the case of our guest, Red Hat CEO Matt Hicks, who began as a developer, got his start tinkering in open source, and was ultimately driven by the unstoppable force of curiosity to take on roles as coach and chief officer. </p>



<p>Matt reflects on the highlights of his career journey, how he managed tradeoffs between his love for coding with his momentum through managerial ranks, and how his passion to be a mentor has been the driving force behind his progress. </p>



<p>Cassidy Williams, who recently joined the C-suite herself, helps to steer the conversation.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>Matt takes us back to the origins of his open source days and the spark that inspired his love for engineering — including the point at which he discovered Linux.</p>



<p>He shares how he began learning from the code itself, which was ultimately a different style of learning than what was available to him at university. Then, it was to the stacks, but not Stack Overflow. Think Barnes and Noble, not YouTube videos.</p>



<p>Imagine trying to&nbsp; navigate getting your first engineering job during&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">the dot-com crash of the late 90s and early 2000s</a>.</p>



<p>We reflect on Matt&#8217;s experience building projects with his daughter, including an AI-powered doorbell he built himself.</p>



<p>Speaking of insatiable curiousity, we’d like to give a big high five to&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1639825/wonton">Wonton</a>, who received the&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4128/inquisitive">Inquisitive Badge</a>.

<p>Today’s streaming services have a vast content library, and a vastly different programming challenge than traditional television stations. Where linear TV tries to schedule content into time slots so the right demographics will see it and enjoy it, streaming services let you watch any content, any time you want. That means these service need to find a way to deliver the right content to every user, balancing what they will want with what will provide value over the long term. That’s where machine learning comes in. </p>



<p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, Ben and Ryan talk with Shrikant Desai and Sowmya Subramanian, two engineering leaders at Warner Bros. Discovery who shape how their ML program figures out what your next favorite show might be. We cover the tools they’ve been using to build their learning pipelines, how a viewer’s history can shape their future, and whether ML algorithms can fill a human curator’s role to surprise and delight viewers.</p>



<h2 id="h-episode-notes">Episode Notes</h2>



<p>Our guests have done most of their ML work on AWS offerings, from&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/">AWS Personalize</a>&nbsp;for their initial recommendation engine to&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">SageMaker</a>&nbsp;for model training and deployment pipeline. Now they’re building models from scratch in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JO2LmAhSuCv9ovk8B3Y2gQj_-tKzO7603YZBgMgNb3pHqpB5YeAh8InDAzWNhks9bQG6bnIo5LxT3VO2jn_MBIBTnb4YFfRKsryHQsFUYSu7tPTHNTudH76f3yfSkyMFXHoiE4kCgNf5OZy6FVVV435tuQJP9AisHkwE6xImexDx2u79M0n0mp1H" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-can-i-do-with-saves"><strong>What can I do with Saves?</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Save questions and/or answers from Stack Overflow or any Stack Exchange network site</li><li>Locate all your saved content within your profile page</li><li>Create and manage custom lists to better organize saved content</li><li>Create private notes on saved posts to collect thoughts, remind yourself why you saved a post in the first place, or draft responses</li><li>Use the “in:saves” search operator to display your saved content&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Why should I use Saves?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Saves is a great tool for organizing useful content you plan to revisit. We found that some users will <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/">search for the same question over and over</a>.&nbsp; For example, if there is an excellent example of a code snippet in an answer, simply save this content so you can revisit it at another time and skip the search engine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep your saved content organized in custom lists so you can more easily and quickly identify your saved content; some examples of lists include “Best practices”, “Duplicates”, and “Programming”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within your saved content, create private notes to collect thoughts, remind yourself why you saved a post in the first place, or draft responses to questions or answers.</p>



<h2><strong>How are Saves different from Bookmarks? Why change the name?</strong></h2>



<p>Since Saves provides even more functionality than Bookmarks, we wanted to make sure this was reflected in what we called the feature.</p>



<p>Unlike Bookmarks, Saves let you favorite BOTH questions and answers. Previously, only questions could be bookmarked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, your saved content, custom lists, and private notes are only visible to you and are not accessible to other users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also a new dedicated tab for Saves prominently displayed on your profile page, so you can easily access your saved content for later.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How do I get started with Saves?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3_1oJqDlpBr1zsivtzDQRKAQtrZsxyO5Ld7KWfj9B3gvqIdORW6V0oNQNvuwuNLhzXpcOJ6MriOwY_7K6CjA1G9Sd3p9sWx2Xrj7aOs-8BmkOSTcNt2CIsLFDGCCp7VS0kRTGVLeUcTbyim1YCLo7-NtXd-XXJih5WouTwZ2OQ2YNrT_ZgkOL5va" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Saves is now available on Stack Overflow and across all Stack Exchange sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get started, when logged into your account:</p>



<ol><li>Select <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bk0MP6r5Y9hl6IkZoLdD8td_DZw1pUOTHdMMwKqIoKAC4hXp_7-h90ldJDtPEeHKcTkqXWxAJTrZI3ulBkNaaRekZwk_TFBKsd36IX1fxIiR30xMhrxV8VuvG2hQkq2-7-t4nemIZwTOnkeSTN1KoPKoTuBb6YeQlZ6BqDSqbXN0ChITK_Q8mALivg" width="20" height="28"> to the left of the question or answer you want to save.</li><li>Click into your profile by selecting your profile picture on the top navigation bar.</li><li>Select the <strong>Saves </strong>tab to view your saved content, create lists, and add private notes.</li></ol>



<p>In addition, after saving a post, you can select “Manage” in the pop-up message to add the content to a specific list and create private notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part about being tech builders is that we get to collaborate with some super-smart teammates. Every brain is unique, and we need this thought diversity to solve problems, build better products, and be more proud of our individual contributions as a result. But if you talk to a lot of people who self-identify as neurodiverse in tech, you’ll notice that folks tend to share the same experience of feeling a lot of pressure to fit in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s podcast, Matt and Ceora talk with Wesley Faulkner, senior community manager at AWS Cloud, and Mariann Lowery, Product / UX Research Lead here at Stack Overflow about their experience as neurodivergent individuals and how we can all do a better job supporting our teammates while taking steps to feel more empowered in our own differences, too.</p>



<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>



<p>Mariann shares how she and her UX research team at Stack Overflow are taking steps to create a more inclusive product experience, while reflecting on her experiences as a mother to a neurodiverse daughter.</p>



<p>Wesley talks about what it’s like to be a developer with dyslexia and why self-empathy and self-compassion have been important to his evolution as a senior leader.</p>



<p>Ceora explains why it’s important to be on a <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/27/psychological-safety-is-critical-for-high-performing-teams/">psychologically safe</a> team from her perspective as a Black woman who is also neurodivergent.</p>



<p>We talk about giving people the space necessary to do their best work, implementing more inclusive hiring practices, and everyday routines that help us stay our happiest and most productive.</p>



<p>We conclude with a note about why supporting neurodiversity is good for everyone of all walks of life.</p>

<h3 id="h-you-ve-visited-this-page-many-times">“You’ve visited this page many times.”</h3>



<p>Stack Overflow’s annual <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Developer Survey</a> answers plenty of questions, but it always raises some new ones, too. Like: Why do our brains work the way they do?</p>



<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020?_ga=2.170070816.1891439336.1663612814-336533442.1635866663#technology-already-visited-feeling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we asked</a> how you feel when you search for an answer and find a purple link—that is, a previously-clicked one. <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fifty-two percent</a> of you described your reaction as “Hello, old friend”: meaning you’ve searched for and located this information before. Maybe you’re trying to remember <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to exit Vim (again)</a>, or maybe you just need to grab a specific regex. Either way, that purple link is reassuring—and, perhaps, exactly what you were looking for.</p>



<p>With more than half of developers greeting purple links like old friends (and another 16% reacting with amusement), it was apparent that people were visiting the same questions repeatedly. In fact, we found that <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/22/asked-and-answered-the-results-for-the-2022-developer-survey-are-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">62%</a> of Stack Overflow’s regular users visited the same question more than once in a three-month span.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly, many of us are eager to outsource the work of information recall by treating external information repositories (especially those rich in user-generated content, such as Stack Overflow and Reddit) as second brains: personal knowledge management systems supported by technology.</p>



<p>This got us thinking: Is this an effective use of brainpower? Does the space we free up by deploying a second brain get used productively for something else? Or is relying on a second brain a lazy habit that leaves us less knowledgeable, capable of making fewer connections?</p>



<p>When I was doing my doctoral work in English and new media studies, I had a tendency to use Wikipedia to keep track of high-level definitions and straightforward details, like when a book was published or when a historical event happened. The definition of “epistemology” stubbornly refused to stick in my head, as did the year Ray Bradbury first published “<a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/AST389/ASoundofThunder.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Sound of Thunder</a>,” so I found myself searching for this information once a week or so, clicking that friendly purple link every time.</p>



<p>Another example: I’ve been making the same oatmeal cookie recipe for years, but I have yet to memorize it; I just Google it whenever I have a craving. Effectively, I rely on the search bar and the purple link to remember the recipe for me.</p>



<p>Why is it easier or more expedient to call up the same information over and over again, rather than committing it to memory? What does our dependence on second brains tell us about the way we learn and work? And for developers, who are constantly deluged with new and complex information, how can the right second brain help your original brain work better?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-second-brain">What is a second brain?</h2>



<p>A second brain is a personal knowledge management system, especially one enabled by technology. The term is often credited to thought leader and author Tiago Forte, whose <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Building a Second Brain</a> course has done a lot to popularize the concept. (These <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">illustrated notes</a> do a great job of summarizing the course material.) More specifically…</p>



<h3 id="h-a-second-brain-is-a-way-of-capturing-and-organizing-information-to-realize-its-value">A second brain is a way of capturing and organizing information to realize its value</h3>



<p>A second brain helps you get a handle on the volume and complexity of information you’re exposed to at virtually all times, with the eventual goal of translating that knowledge into something useful. This is especially critical for developers and other people whose work involves constant exposure to an ever-expanding pool of complex, technical information. Without help from the structures and technologies that comprise a second brain, you can’t absorb or remember the information you’re immersed in, much less call up that information when you might need it to solve a future problem or kick off a new project.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="420" height="630" src="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Pensieve-1-420x630.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-20776" srcset="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Pensieve-1-420x630.jpeg 420w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Pensieve-1-200x300.jpeg 200w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Pensieve-1-768x1152.jpeg 768w , https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Pensieve-1.jpeg 1024w " sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /><figcaption>HarshLight from San Jose, CA, USA, CC BY 2.0 <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the <em>Harry Potter </em>series, Dumbledore’s <a href="https://tenor.com/bkvFW.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pensieve</a> serves a second-brain function, storing disconnected thoughts and memories and shaping them into coherent patterns to inform actions and decisions. “One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure,” explains Dumbledore. “It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”</p>



<h3 id="h-a-second-brain-reduces-cognitive-load-by-doing-your-thinking-and-remembering-for-you">A second brain reduces cognitive load by doing your thinking and remembering for you</h3>



<p>Think of a second brain as <a href="https://aseemthakar.com/how-to-build-a-second-brain-as-a-software-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an extension of your mind</a>: somewhere you can offload cognitive work so you don’t have to struggle to remember information or put it to good use. Like Sherlock Holmes’s <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-memory-factory/202105/use-sherlock-holmes-mind-palace-technique-improve-your-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mind palace</a>, a second brain is a system for collecting, storing, and curating the tide of information that continually washes over us. “It’s a way of ensuring that the ludicrous amount of information we have to deal with day-to-day stops bouncing around our heads and is recorded somewhere where we can make sense of it in the long term,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mpBC83l1dY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explains</a> Stack Overflow developer advocate and evangelist Matt Kiernander.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-second-brain-is-built-on-digital-technology">A second brain is built on digital technology</h3>



<p>It’s certainly possible to cobble together a second brain using manual methods, from a notebook to a filing cabinet to a wall plastered with sticky notes. In college, I took notes in the margins of secondhand books as I read, blithely assuming I would remember what my scribbled abbreviations meant (spoiler: I would not, nor would the bookstore buy back any of my books).</p>



<p>None of these analog methods is scalable, portable, searchable, or capable of handling data in any format—all essential qualities in the kind of second brain you need. Unless you have access to a Pensieve, I suppose, a digital second brain is far and away the best and most natural choice for most of us who sit in front of computers all day. Your second brain must be:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Scalable</strong>, so you can capture and preserve a virtually unlimited amount of information.</li><li><strong>Capable of storing and organizing data in various formats</strong>, from images to videos to chunks of code.</li><li><strong>Portable</strong>, to permit quick capture and editing of information.</li><li><strong>Searchable</strong>, so you can easily pull up the knowledge you need when you need it.</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-what-platforms-are-developers-using-as-their-second-brains">What platforms are developers using as their second brains?</h4>



<p>We’re awfully proud of the fact that <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90%</a> of developers turn to Stack Overflow when they get stuck, often via a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/navigational-query" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">navigational query</a>. (For example, “how to exit vim stack overflow” will take you to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this question</a>, viewed 2.7 million times and counting.) Often, developers return to the same question or answer regularly. <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/22/asked-and-answered-the-results-for-the-2022-developer-survey-are-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More than 60%</a> of regular Stack Overflow users visit the same question more than once in a three-month period—so if you’re thinking, “Didn’t I <em>just </em>look this up?”, the answer is probably yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These findings reveal how many developers rely on our public platform to serve a second-brain function. Most developers are inundated with information: languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools with their own use cases, shortcuts, workarounds, and optimizations. Second brains tailored for developers’ needs help us capture, organize, and surface knowledge, reducing cognitive load while realizing more value from the knowledge we’re exposed to.</p>



<p>Other second-brain tools developers favor include <a href="https://www.notionsecondbrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Notion</a> (whose digital system is actually called Second Brain), <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Obsidian</a> (which bills itself as a personal second brain), <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evernote</a>, and <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roam</a>, just to name a few.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-our-reliance-on-second-brains-reveal-about-how-we-think-and-work">What does our reliance on second brains reveal about how we think and work?</h2>



<p>Knowing that so many of us rely on second brains, we wondered what this dependence could tell us about human memory and cognition, especially when it comes to developers and how they work.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-we-need-help-accessing-knowledge-and-memories-over-time">We need help accessing knowledge and memories over time</h3>



<p>In his 2001 book <em>The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers</em>, Harvard researcher Daniel Schacter defines seven “sins of memory,” including transience and absentmindedness, the two failings most relevant to us here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transience refers to memories that simply don’t stick in our minds, or “the decreasing accessibility of memory over time,” according to the <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/sins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Psychological Association</a>. This usually involves new information that you’re trying to remember, from an unfamiliar function to the name of that person you were just introduced to.</p>



<p>Absentmindedness refers to “lapses of attention and forgetting to do things,” per the <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/sins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">APA</a>. “This sin operates both when a memory is formed (the encoding stage) and when a memory is accessed (the retrieval stage).” Classic examples of absentmindedness: forgetting where you left your phone, accidentally throwing away <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/half-a-billion-in-bitcoin-lost-in-the-dump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a billion in Bitcoin</a>, or leaving your <a href="https://www.classicfm.com/artists/yo-yo-ma/stradivarius-cello-left-in-new-york-taxi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3.5 million cello</a> in the back of a cab.</p>



<p>A second brain helps us overcome transience and absentmindedness by allowing us to categorize, search, and retrieve information and experiences. Ideally, a second brain empowers you to work “more effectively in the moment,” <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> Tiago Forte: “You can spin up and complete your projects far faster because you’re starting with a collection of valuable material and reusing work you’ve already performed instead of a blank page.”</p>



<h3 id="h-we-re-overloaded-with-information">We’re overloaded with information…</h3>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously covered</a>, there’s <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/attention-and-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strong correlation</a> between how much attention we give something and our ability to remember it later. Both transience and absentmindedness are exacerbated when we’re unable to focus, and chronic multitasking can cause us to perform worse on simple memory and cognition tests, according to <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2018/10/25/decade-data-reveals-heavy-multitaskers-reduced-memory-psychologist-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a study</a> from the Stanford Memory Laboratory. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3656338/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Things get even harder</a> for people experiencing significant stress and anxiety at work, whether those feelings stem from clinical anxiety or a professional culture of looming deadlines, unsupportive managers, and unrealistic expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most developers encounter constant, overlapping distractions: pings from chat and email programs, urgent tickets, the need to write code while joining calls and preparing for other meetings. In such a noisy environment, it’s no wonder that things slip your mind. Information overload leads to information exhaustion: We’re exposed to so much information every day that we simply can’t absorb and remember it all without an assist from technology. If you’ll pardon the plug, this is why companies like <a href="https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/microsoft-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/dropbox-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dropbox</a>, and <a href="https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/elastic-case-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elastic</a> use <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stack Overflow for Teams</a> as an organization-wide second brain, to ease the cognitive burden of constant context-switching and to manage collective knowledge.</p>



<h3 id="h-but-we-don-t-want-to-miss-anything">…but we don’t want to miss anything</h3>



<p>While most of us are all-too-aware of our information exhaustion, it’s still a priority for us to absorb and retain as much information as possible, especially as we move from project to project or job to job. But that’s much easier said than done. Developers face a proliferation of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools, all of which have various, sometimes-overlapping applications, best practices, common pitfalls, and so on. No wonder some feel there’s simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uud5dm/too_much_to_learn_web_development_sde/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too much to learn</a>.</p>



<p>A second brain allows us to reduce noise and manage information overload without worrying that scraps of invaluable knowledge will slip through the cracks while we have 800 different mental tabs open. “By outsourcing the job of remembering to an external tool,” <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> Forte, “we gain the peace of mind of knowing exactly what to do with each piece of incoming information and the confidence that it will never be forgotten.”</p>



<p>Matt Kiernander <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mpBC83l1dY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">points out</a> that a second brain is enormously helpful for retaining the knowledge you’ll need for repeatable tasks. If, like Matt, you find yourself Googling how to set up PATH variables for your command line every time you set up a new environment, or trying to remember the predefined list of tools and npm packages you need to install, offloading that information to a second brain could save you hours of time and didn’t-I-used-to-know-this frustration.</p>



<p>Second brains also allow you to make the knowledge you acquire as you move between jobs and projects portable, so that you can bring information like useful code snippets with you on your professional journey. The same goes for using your second brain to document the educational resources you encounter as you learn different technologies, languages, and systems.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/thought-leadership/prioritize-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best developers</a> are <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/great-developers-never-stop-learning-77b9ce867eac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">constantly learning</a>: reskilling and upskilling, mastering new systems, adding additional languages and technologies to their repertoires. Instead of information going in one ear and out the other, a second brain “helps you take control of your own learning,” <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/">says</a> Forte, curating your learnings in a searchable format you can return to anytime you need to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-innovation-is-rooted-in-knowledge">Innovation is rooted in knowledge</h2>



<p>When you can access information from your personal knowledge store when you need it, you can apply that wealth of experience to new skills and new projects. The idea is to surround yourself with context-rich associations and priceless nuggets of insight and problem-solving that you’ve collected and stored over time—the contents of your mind palace. The value of a second brain goes way beyond reminding you (once again) how to exit Vim or how much brown sugar your favorite cookies call for. It’s about making your learnings, insights, and experiences accessible and actionable as you navigate your professional journey.</p>

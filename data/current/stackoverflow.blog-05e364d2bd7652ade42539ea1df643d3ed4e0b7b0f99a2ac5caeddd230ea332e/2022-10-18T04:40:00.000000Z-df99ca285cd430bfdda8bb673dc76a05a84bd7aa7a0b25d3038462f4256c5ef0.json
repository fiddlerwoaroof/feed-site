But if you work in tech as an engineer, you have the unfortunate perspective of knowing all of the tiny details that have the potential to go wrong. Even when everything is going <em>right</em>, those edge cases can still feel haunting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today’s podcast episode, the home team and Jon Chan get together to laugh at themselves as they reflect on their fears of self-driving cars and share horror stories of recruiters promising job offers that turned out to be scam artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Episode notes:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before jumping into driverless car talk, Ben shares a heads up about <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/elpaso/news/press-releases/fbi-warns-cyber-criminals-are-using-fake-job-listings-to-target-applicants-personally-identifiable-information\">fake jobs at credible companies</a> that are actually phishing scams meant to steal your identity and hijack your bank accounts.

  "content":"\n<p>It’s been 13 years since Stack Overflow was founded. It began with a simple mission, to serve as a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. It’s become a place where anyone could ask for help or share some knowledge and where all the content created by the community would be open and accessible to the public. The landscape of software and technology has evolved tremendously in the decade since, and Stack Overflow has become a central hub in the day-to-day practice of software development for coders around the globe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From this seed, an entire universe of Q&amp;A sites blossomed, becoming the Stack Exchange Network. Some of these sites focused on topics closely related to software development, but many others centered on topics—cooking, parenting, home repair—that had nothing to do with computer programming, but fostered a devoted community of experts who built up tremendous libraries of knowledge in their particular field. Now we’ve got over 175 sites building individual libraries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we are celebrating a group of sites that passed their 10th birthday during the first half of 2021. They have helped millions learn new languages, repair their cars, and sharpen their skills at code review. If you have a favorite question, answer, or experience from one of these sites, please share it in the comments. We’ll add our favorites to the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/\">Graphic Design</a> <br>A site for professional and hobbyist graphic designers that helps to answer questions like <a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/47050\">understanding design choices</a>, <a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/126121\">making graphic software do what you want</a>, <a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/2984\">getting your design properly printed</a>, and <a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/26844\">dealing with problematic clients</a>.<br><br> – Highest Upvoted <a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/5446/making-the-background-of-an-image-transparent-in-gimp\">Question</a> / Most Popular Tag: <a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://dba.stackexchange.com/\">Database Administrators</a><br>For those needing expert answers to advanced database-related questions concerning traditional SQL RDBMS and NoSQL alternatives.

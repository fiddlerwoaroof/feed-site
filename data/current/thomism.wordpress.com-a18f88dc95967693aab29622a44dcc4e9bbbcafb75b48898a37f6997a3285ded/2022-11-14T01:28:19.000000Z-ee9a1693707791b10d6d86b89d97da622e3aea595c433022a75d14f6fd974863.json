  "content":"<p>If our accounts of death are limited to the Christian account of death as encounter with the God and the physicalist account of death as non-existence, both take death as a return to the principle of the self – either a soul arising from a divine act of creation and returning to it or from a constellation of causes that were as indifferent to the self’s arising as they’ll be to its scattering in death. One way or another, we meet our maker.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this was unavoidable due to death inescapably requiring an account of what the person is. What, after all, does does fundamentally bring to an end? My only interest here is how it seems axiomatic that it involves some sort of return to the principle of one’s being, and, given that this is encountered precisely in death, requires that the person himself is not that source.</p>\n"

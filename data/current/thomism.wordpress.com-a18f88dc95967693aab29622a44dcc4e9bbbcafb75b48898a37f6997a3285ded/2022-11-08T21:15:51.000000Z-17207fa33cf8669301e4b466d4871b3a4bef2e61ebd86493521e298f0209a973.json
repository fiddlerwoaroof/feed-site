  "content":"<p>God, pure actuality, transcends the distinction between the absolute (for which real distinction is a limitation) and the relative (for which real distinction is a perfection.)</p>\n<p>We can understand God as subsistent being, and we can understand being as divided into absolute and relative, but we cannot understand God or being as the simultaneous existence of the absolute and relative, since this is a contradiction and contradictions can neither be understood nor be. This is just as true of abstract wholes as of transcendent wholes, e.g. “animal” is an abstraction from cats, dogs, fish, etc. or even as an abstraction from cats and non-cats, but we can’t understand “animal” as though it were the subsistent unity of cat and non-cat at the same time and same respect, since this is contradictory.</p>\n<p>If God simply showed us the transcendent unity of absolute and relative, we would see how relatives exist so as not to exclude absolutes and vice versa. At the moment we only see that this is true so far as both are actualities, but we can’t conceive both actualities formally in being.</p>\n<p>Perfections possessed as contradictory in creatures are possessed without contradiction in God. In using creatures to understand God, we unavoidably run encounter times when there will be a contradiction in our thought that must be judged not to exist in God, but all this means is that if we try to understand an unlimited perfection as a series of limited ones we fail to understand it.</p>\n"

  "content":"\n\n<p> If Hellfire is <em>divine love as spurned </em>then to lessen the intensity of its pains lessens the intensity of divine love even for the saved. If God is,<em> a la</em> C.S. Lewis, indifferent or merely permissive to the wickedness of the damned this argues for an indifference to the saved as well. If I’m indifferent to the loss of something, what does this say about my possession of it? </p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n"

  "content":"<p>1.) Real being first divides into the absolute (defined in itself) and the relative (defined with another.)</p>\n<p>2.) God as pure act transcends all divisions in being so far as these involve imperfection.</p>\n<p>3.) Real division is a perfection of relative being.</p>\n<p>4.) Human intellects unite distinct things in a single concept only at the expense of a clear and explicit conception of their distinction. If we consider the generic unity of badger and possum in “mammal” we lose the distinction of species, if we consider the specific unity of two individuals we lose the division of the individuals.</p>\n<p>5.) A human intellect understands a transcendent being with a concept that unites the lower-order things it transcends. Nevertheless, a genus or species  have only a logical unity whereas a transcendent being has real unity.</p>\n"

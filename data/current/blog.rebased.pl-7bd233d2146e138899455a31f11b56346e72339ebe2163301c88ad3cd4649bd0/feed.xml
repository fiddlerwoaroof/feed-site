        <title>Using SQLite on the bus</title>
        <description>
          
            Recently a friend asked me to find out a certain piece of data. Which bus route in PoznaÅ„ is the longest? As Iâ€™m a massive ferroequinologist and public transport enthusiast, this question is right up my alley. However, this information is rarely accessible directly. Public transport planning is a complex...

        <description>
          
            Turning on the lights used to require a walk to the wall switch; nowadays, various smart devices exist to relieve you of that inconvenience. In this post I make such a device, but avoid putting a HTTP server on it. Read on to see how and why. So this is...

        <title>ELI5: Bitfields</title>
        <description>
          
            What is this bitfield thing? An array of true/false values. Usually a fixed-size array, due to platform constraints. Also a very compact array â€“ taking exactly one bit to store each element. In other words: a boolean vector or set. So does anyone use it? Plenty of usage around, many...

In this short post Iâ€™ll show you how applying DRY to regular expressions in JavaScript can be tricky. The examples will be written for Node.js, but the idea applies to other environments...

            Sometimes, even veterans can be stumped by their language of choice. And not even by the newest, latest additions, but the core language itself. This is such a story, about an obscure corner of Python. It starts with a legacy1 project Legacy as in â€˜still not fully migrated from Python...

        <description>
          
            At Rebased we have an internal time tracking project called Harmonogram. Its backend is built in Ruby on Rails.

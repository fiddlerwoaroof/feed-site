  "content":"<p>Hi there,</p>\n\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregmolnar\">Greg</a>, bringing you the latest changes in Rails.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46448\">Fix Enumerable#many? to handle all block parameters</a>\nBefore this fix, <em>Enumerable#many?</em> didn’t forward the block parameters to the block, so if someone called it in a chain with <em>each_with_index</em>, the index wasn’t passed to the block.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46461\">Use filename when printing pending migrations</a>\nBy using <em>filename</em>, instead of <em>basename</em>, the full path of the migration will be displayed, which can be useful when migration files are stored in multiple directories, for instance in a multi-db app.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46425\">Make error highlight readable on dark mode</a>\nThe recently introduced error highlighting on the error pages were hard to read in dark mode, but not anymore.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46469\">Improve the MissingExactTemplate error page</a>\nThis improvement to the MissingExactTemplate error page adds the actual controller and action name to the page, replacing the generic example there before.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20221104-20221111\">19 people</a> contributed to Rails this past week! Until next time!</p>\n\n<p><i><a href=\"https://world.hey.com/this.week.in.rails\">Subscribe</a> to get these updates mailed to you.</i></p>"

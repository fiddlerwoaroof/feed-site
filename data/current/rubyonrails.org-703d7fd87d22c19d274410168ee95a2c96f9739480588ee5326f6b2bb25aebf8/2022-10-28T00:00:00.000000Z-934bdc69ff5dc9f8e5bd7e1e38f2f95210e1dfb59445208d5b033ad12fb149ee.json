  "content":"<p>Hi, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/morgoth85\">Wojtek</a> here with this week’s news from the Rails world.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45527\">Support checked as a keyword argument in check_box_tag and radio_button_tag</a><br>\nNow the form helper</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>f.check_box &quot;admin&quot;, checked: false\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>works as expected. Previously it had to be passed as positional argument.<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46273\"><br>\nAllow Active Record adapter “execute” to retry on connection-related exception</a><br>\nSetting <em>allow_retry</em> to <em>true</em> causes the database to reconnect and retry executing the SQL statement in case of a connection-related exception. Should only be used for known idempotent queries.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46280\">Expose the “request.parameter_filter”</a><br>\nFeature is useful when one wants to filter some hashes based on the same parameter filter as the request:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>request.parameter_filter.filter(&quot;secret&quot; =&gt; &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;something&quot; =&gt; &quot;bar&quot;))\n#=&gt; { &quot;secret&quot; =&gt; &quot;[FILTERED]&quot;, &quot;something&quot; =&gt; &quot;bar&quot; }\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46339\">Adds “validate” to foreign keys and check constraints in database schema file</a><br>\n Previously, <em>schema.rb</em> would not record if <em>validate: false</em> had been used when adding a foreign key or check<br>\n constraint, so restoring a database from the schema could result in foreign keys or check constraints being<br>\n incorrectly validated.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46305\">Fix “MemoryStore” to preserve entries TTL when incrementing or decrementing</a><br>\nThe change is to be consistent with how <em>MemCachedStore</em> and <em>RedisCacheStore</em> behaves, ie don’t remove the expiration value.</p>\n\n<p>There were <a href=\"https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20221022-20221028\">23</a> contributors to Rails this week.

  "content":"<p>Hi, Petrik here with this week’s news from the Rails world.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46342\">Improve the “missing template” error page</a><br>\nThis error page got a nice overhaul with clearer wording, making it more helpful, especially for beginners.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46331\">Allow specifying columns to use in ActiveRecord::Base object queries</a><br>\nSupport for composite primary keys in Rails is <a href=\"https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/rfc-finally-support-composite-primary-keys/81368/12\">getting prioritized</a>. This change is fundamental for supporting composite primary keys in Rails and utilizing tenant based sharding.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46251\">Fix <em>Time#change</em> and <em>Time#advance</em> for times around the end of Daylight Saving Time</a><br>\nPreviously, when <em>Time#change</em> or <em>Time#advance</em> constructed a time inside the final stretch of Daylight Saving Time (DST), the non-DST offset would always be chosen for local times. This commit fixes <em>Time#change</em> and <em>Time#advance</em> to choose the offset that matches the original time’s offset when possible.<br>\nIf you are like me and find Daylight Saving Time confusing, the PR has better examples. \uD83D\uDE04</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus/releases/tag/v3.1.1\">Stimulus 3.1.1 has been released</a><br>\nThis release fixes a memory leak and adds support for support custom Action Options.</p>\n\n<p>There were <a href=\"https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20221028-20221104\">19</a> contributors to Rails this week.

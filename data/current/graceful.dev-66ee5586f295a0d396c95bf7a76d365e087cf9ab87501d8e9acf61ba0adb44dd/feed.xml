<p>Hiya graceful devs! It&#8217;s been a little while since the last update. My real-life vegetable garden is tailing off its production as the St. Louis weather cools, but Graceful.Dev updates are going strong.</p>



<span id="more-33711"></span>



<h2>Content Updates</h2>



<p>Since the last news post, we&#8217;ve added a few brand-new topics to the collection:</p>



<ul><li>As a follow-on to <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/modules/2022/topic/ruby-sequencing-operator/" data-type="sfwd-topic" data-id="33331">Ruby Sequencing Operator</a>, the new <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/modules/2022/topic/bouncer-method-in-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-topic" data-id="33380"><strong>Bouncer Method</strong></a> topic covers an important technique for checking method inputs at the door&#8212;with a uniquely Ruby twist.</li><li>I&#8217;m especially excited about the new video on <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/modules/2022/topic/create-seam/" data-type="sfwd-topic" data-id="33539"><strong>Creating Seams</strong></a>. This one is a little longer than usual, but I think the extra length is justified. Understanding how to create and exploit seams in existing code is among the most essential tools a developer can have. The demonstration language is PHP, but the technique shown is universal.</li><li>Most recent is a new topic on <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/modules/2022/topic/ruby-block-local-variable/" data-type="sfwd-topic" data-id="33706"><strong>Ruby Block-Local Variables</strong></a>. This addition to the <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/scintillating-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31963">Scintillating Ruby</a> course covers a somewhat obscure Ruby feature for &#8220;shadowing&#8221; variables used within a block. If you&#8217;ve ever had questions about Ruby variable scoping within methods, this episode may clarify your understanding!</li><li>New freebie: not new to the site, but the classic video on subclassing Ruby&#8217;s core Array class&#8212;and why you probably shouldn&#8217;t&#8212;is now <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/the-freebies/modules/ruby-core-objects-and-datastructures/topic/episode-018-subclassing-array/">free to all</a>. So tell your friends!</li></ul>



<h2>Site Updates</h2>



<ul><li><strong>New email series: </strong>As you may have already seen, we&#8217;ve started sending out a new Graceful.Dev welcome series of emails to members! Called the &#8220;Docent&#8217;s Tour&#8221;, each email in the series introduces an area of the Graceful.Dev content, and offers a tip on making the most out of the site. You can control whether you receive these emails in <a href="https://graceful.dev/members/me/profile/edit/group/2/">your profile</a>.</li><li><strong>New forum:</strong> in an effort to boost the community aspect of the site, I&#8217;ve kicked off a new forum area for general discussion called <a href="https://graceful.dev/forums/forum/the-patio/">The Patio</a>. Come <a href="https://graceful.dev/forums/topic/say-hello/">say hello</a>, and feel free to kick off your own threads on topics technical or non!</li><li>A small tweak: as you may have noticed, the script-and-code for each topic has moved. It&#8217;s no longer a fold-out section. Now we&#8217;re making better use of the site&#8217;s theme, and giving the [tran]scripts their own tab:</li></ul>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1024x367.png" alt="" class="wp-image-33712" width="512" height="184" srcset="https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1024x367.png 1024w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-300x108.png 300w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-768x275.png 768w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-624x224.png 624w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png 1029w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>


<p>And that&#8217;s all for now. Stay graceful!</p>

<p>Hi there graceful devs!</p>



<p>Things are settling down in the Graceful.Dev garden after my big birthday sale. Now that the big push to <a href="https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/graceful.dev-site-news-13.png" data-type="attachment" data-id="33146">organize all past topics</a> into <a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-paths/" data-type="page" data-id="32540">Garden Paths</a> is done, I&#8217;ve had some time to make a new screencast! I&#8217;ve also been working on bug fixes and system updates, as always.</p>



<h2>Content Updates</h2>



<ul><li>Inspired by a member comment, <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/modules/2022/topic/ruby-sequencing-operator/" data-type="sfwd-topic" data-id="33331"><strong>Ruby Sequencing Operator</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a brand new addition to <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/scintillating-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31963">Scintillating Ruby</a> (and to <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="28027">The Tapastry</a>). In a quest for expressive guard clauses, it goes into some Ruby syntax minutiae around statement modifiers, semicolons, and chaining statements together.</li></ul>



<h2>Site Updates</h2>



<p>Lots of small fixes and updates.</p>



<ul><li>Clean up some old shortcodes in the MOOM course.</li><li>Fix a transient bug that rendered the <a href="https://graceful.dev/blog/" data-type="page" data-id="28568">Blog</a> page blank</li><li>Fix some messed-up comment formatting in <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/flawless-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="3478">Flawless Ruby</a></li><li>Upgrade to the WordPress 6 and LearnDash 4 (delayed til after the birthday sale).</li><li>Address some topic organization issues in <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/rigorous-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32110">Rigorous Ruby</a></li><li>Turn off Groups. No one was using them. They might return in another form someday&#8230;</li><li>Fix issue where some MOOM students couldn&#8217;t access the MOOM forum</li><li>Improve styling of comment reply buttons</li><li>Make <a href="https://graceful.dev/pay-with-a-postcard/" data-type="page" data-id="32948">Pay with a Postcard</a> its own page and make the option more prominent</li><li>Some homepage tweaks</li><li>Add a Help menu link to the <a href="https://graceful.dev/forums/forum/meta/graceful-dev-site-features/">feature request forum</a> </li><li>Remove some plugins that weren&#8217;t adding value</li></ul>



<p>That&#8217;s all for now. Stay graceful,</p>



<p>&#8212; Avdi</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hiya folks!</p>



<p>Avdi here, head gardener at Graceful.Dev. It&#8217;s my 42nd birthday today, and longtime followers know what that means:<strong> </strong>the biggest sale of the year! And this year, it&#8217;s bigger than ever before.</p>



<span id="more-33241"></span>



<p>First, the TL;DR version: <strong>use code <mark style="background-color:#fcb900" class="has-inline-color">HAPPY0X2A</mark> to wish me happy birthday and get 42% off <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses">ANY individually purchasable course[s]</a> OR a monthly or annual <a href="https://graceful.dev/join">Pro membership</a>.</strong> And since this is a very special birthday, I&#8217;ve decided to do something I don&#8217;t do very often: make the discount <strong>permanent</strong> for subscriptions. That&#8217;s right: if you use this discount for a Pro membership, <strong>your discounted rate will be locked-in</strong> for as long as your subscription stays active.</p>



<p>With the short version out of the way, I want to talk a little about what makes this birthday so special.</p>



<p>First off, I&#8217;m turning 42! That&#8217;s an <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/42">auspicious number</a>. And while I&#8217;m not sure I have any ultimate answers, I can certainly say the questions have only become more interesting with time. I hope you&#8217;ll raise a <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Pan_Galactic_Gargle_Blaster">pan-galactic gargle blaster</a> with me today!</p>



<p>Second, RubyTapas&#8212;the screencast series that morphed into Graceful.Dev&#8212;is <strong>ten years old today</strong>! Which calls for a special celebration. And that brings me to the third thing that makes this birthday special&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>Graceful.Dev now offers <em><a href="/courses">over two-dozen new courses</a></em>.</strong> No, you did not read that wrong. Since the start of the year, we&#8217;ve gone from a handful of courses&#8230; to (at last count) <em>thirty-six</em>. </p>



<p>How is this possible? Well, lemme &#8216;splain with some history. Ten years ago I kicked off RubyTapas with a simple concept: <em>what if programming screencasts were short</em>? I launched a subscription-based show of frequent, tightly-edited, sub-five-minute episodes, each of which sought to introduce <em>one</em> new idea. Beginning with three episodes a week, it eventually settled down to a weekly format. </p>



<p>A decade later, as Graceful.Dev carries forward the legacy of RubyTapas, that library of topical screencasts numbers close to 700 episodes. And because I&#8217;ve always preferred to focus on stable language features, best practices, and timeless patterns, 99% of that material is still as current and useful now as when it was first published.</p>



<p>But&#8230; that archive was a lot to wade through for newcomers! And only a fraction of it had been extracted and arranged into courses such as <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/moom/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="581"><em>Master the Object-Oriented Mindset in Ruby and Rails</em></a>. While the Graceful.Dev library might well be one of the richest resources available for deepening and growing your coding practice (particularly for Ruby developers), it had become unapproachable.</p>



<p>So this Spring I decided that the best way to celebrate the upcoming anniversary was to finally complete a project I&#8217;ve been dreaming of for years: the total course-ification of ten years and nearly 700 episodes of content. I created <a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-paths/" data-type="page" data-id="32540">The Garden Paths</a>: each a suggested pathway through a curated selection of topics on a particular theme. </p>



<p>Here are just a few examples of the brand new paths:</p>



<ul><li>Broaden and deepen your practice, your teamwork, and your career with <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/practices-of-a-graceful-developer/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32448">Practices of a Graceful developer</a>.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/scintillating-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31963">Scintillating Ruby</a>: for graduates of <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/flawless-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="3478">Flawless Ruby</a>, a deeper dive into Ruby&#8217;s core syntax and semantics.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/investigative-debugging/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32610">Investigative Debugging</a>: a course on using advanced surveillance tools to peer deeply into what programs are up to.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/collected-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32070">Collected Ruby</a>: a master class in working with Ruby&#8217;s collection classes and the Enumerable API.</li><li>Rummage through <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/toolshed/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32287">The Graceful Toolshed</a> to level-up your development environment.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/rigorous-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32110">Rigorous Ruby</a>: learn how to write tests strategically, effectively, and pragmatically.</li><li>Learn to apply proven patterns of enterprise application with <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/domain-modeling-in-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32207">Domain Modeling in Ruby</a>.</li><li></li></ul>



<p>There are many, <a href="/courses">many more</a>. Some of the more mature paths are available for individual purchase. Others are only available to <a href="https://graceful.dev/join/" data-type="page" data-id="28348">Pro members</a>.</p>



<p>These paths are more than just quick-and-dirty categorizations. To build them I reviewed hundreds of videos and scripts in order to make sure each one ended up in the right path, in an order that makes sense. Each path has a freshly written intro, and each is broken down further into thematic modules.</p>



<p>The paths are categorized on their maturity as well, to give you an idea of which ones are considered fleshed-out courses of study, and which are still germinating. Finally, the garden paths are themselves arranged into <a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-tours/" data-type="page" data-id="32725">Garden Tours</a>. If you&#8217;re not sure where to start or what course to take next, these tours can help orient you! </p>



<p>Taking time to &#8220;put the house in order&#8221; in this way sets the stage for a flowering of new content at Graceful.Dev. If you&#8217;ve never taken a look at Graceful.Dev before, I hope this news prompts you to check out the garden we&#8217;re tending and growing. If you&#8217;ve looked at RubyTapas or Graceful.Dev in the past but haven&#8217;t been back recently&#8230; well, it&#8217;s a whole new experience now and I hope you&#8217;ll come [re]join us. This garden is flowering and I can&#8217;t wait to share the fruits with you.</p>



<p>And remember: this week only, starting on July 5th 2022, you can <a href="https://thrivecart.graceful.dev/gracefuldev-pro-membership/">lock-in 42% off the usual $25/mo or $250/yr</a>. Or if you prefer, you can use the discount to purchase <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses">courses</a> individually. The coupon code for this deal is: <strong><strong><mark style="background-color:#fcb900" class="has-inline-color">HAPPY0X2A</mark></strong></strong> </p>



<p>(Oh and if you can&#8217;t afford the membership even with the discounted rate, due to exchange rates, hardship, etc., our <a href="https://graceful.dev/pay-with-a-postcard/" data-type="page" data-id="32948">pay-with-a-postcard option</a> is available as always!)</p>



<p>Thanks for reading this far, thanks for helping celebrate my birthday, and stay graceful!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the biggest announcements in  RubyTapas/Graceful.Dev history! 10 years of content now completely organized into 36 courses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hi there graceful devs,</p>



<p>Boy I&#8217;ve been waiting (and working) a long time to be able to announce today&#8217;s news:  every single topic in the Graceful.Dev catalog&#8212;all ten years of material&#8212;is now organized into &#8220;<a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-paths/" data-type="page" data-id="32540">Garden Path</a>&#8221; courses. No more slogging through entire <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="28027">Tapastry</a> (unless you want to!); no more searching for topics on <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/rigorous-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32110">testing</a> or <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/refined-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32180">refactoring</a> or <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/practices-of-a-graceful-developer/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32448">growing your developer career</a>. Now you can find the <a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-paths/" data-type="page" data-id="32540">Garden Path</a> on the theme you&#8217;re interested in and follow it. Each Garden Path has a new introduction, and each is further broken down into cohesive modules.</p>



<span id="more-33143"></span>



<p>Not content to organize all the content into garden paths, I&#8217;ve also collected the paths into <a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-tours/" data-type="page" data-id="32725">Garden Tours</a>. If you&#8217;re not sure where to start, or what order to take the courses in, the <a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-tours/" data-type="page" data-id="32725">Garden Tours</a> page can guide you!</p>

<p>Yes, the site is in full riotous summer bloom, now boasting <strong><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses">36 courses</a></strong> in total. And to celebrate, we&#8217;re updating the sites style and branding a tiny bit. Up til now, it&#8217;s been kind of a toss-up whether we were going for more of a <em>dancing</em> motif (plus jellyfish; I mean, they kind of dance, right?) or a <em>garden </em>theme. But after a Spring spent raising my own real-world vegetable garden while tending to this virtual garden of courses, the right choice seemed pretty obvious. As you might notice in the updated site logo, we&#8217;re going all-in on the floral/garden theme.</p>



<p>I just want to take a moment here and say &#8220;thank you&#8221; to everyone who has supported the site by becoming a Pro member, and a special big thanks to everyone who has come along for the ride through the RubyTapas-to-Graceful.Dev transition. Today&#8217;s announcement represents months of reviewing and categorizing and organizing material day-in and day-out. But in a larger sense it&#8217;s the payoff of something I&#8217;ve spent years working towards: a platform that could make this kind of massive content re-org tractable in the first place. Thank you for believing in and supporting this botanical garden of coding know-how. I&#8217;m so glad I can finally deliver the kind of learning experience I&#8217;ve been dreaming of for years.</p>



<p>And of course, like any true garden, these courses will continue to be tended. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to give feedback on the organization, the order of topics, holes in the courses you wish would be filled with new content, broken links, etc! Graceful.Dev is a community garden, and it&#8217;s better for everyone&#8217;s input.</p>



<p>Stay graceful,</p>



<p>&#8212; Avdi</p>

<p>Hiya graceful devs! I know it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve written an update. This isn&#8217;t because there&#8217;s nothing new on the site. It&#8217;s actually because I&#8217;ve been deep in one of the most ambitious content improvements in the combined history of RubyTapas and Graceful.Dev!</p>



<span id="more-32249"></span>



<p>So, as you know if you&#8217;ve been a member for a while, Graceful.Dev&#8217;s content is dominated by the nearly decade-long run of RubyTapas episodes now found in <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="28027">The Tapastry</a>, spanning over 650 topics. Because I&#8217;ve always leaned towards covering subjects with perennial value, 99% of that material is still relevant to anyone using Ruby for work or play. But for someone who wasn&#8217;t following RubyTapas from the beginning, it&#8217;s a bit much to wade through. Breaking that material out into approachable, cohesive courses has always been a goal. Courses like <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/moom/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="581">Master the Object-Oriented Mindset in Ruby and Rails</a> and <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/flawless-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="3478">Flawless Ruby</a> were early proofs-of-concept.</p>



<p>Now that the technical underpinnings of Graceful.Dev are stable, the stage is set for course-ification on a large scale. And I&#8217;ve set myself the somewhat ambitious goal of <strong>having every single RubyTapas episode organized into topical courses by my birthday, July 5.</strong> </p>



<p>More and more I think of this site as a &#8220;garden of content&#8221;, much like my beloved <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/">Missouri Botanical Gardens</a>, only with short videos and transcripts instead of daffodils. In keeping with that theme (which you&#8217;ll soon be seeing reflected more in the site branding), I&#8217;m calling these courses &#8220;<strong>garden paths</strong>&#8220;. Rather than being traditional planned courses, these are suggested pathways through the site&#8217;s content.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m well on the way already! You might have seen the signs if you&#8217;ve scanned <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses">the course list</a> lately. New to the site are:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/rigorous-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32110">Rigorous Ruby</a>: all about testing Ruby code, the philosophy of testing, TDD/BDD, RSpec, and mock/stub objects.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/crystaline-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31983">Crystaline Ruby</a>: a follow-on to <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/flawless-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="3478">Flawless Ruby</a> for deepening your handiness with Ruby&#8217;s core object types.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/scintillating-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31963">Scintillating Ruby</a>: another advanced Ruby fluency path, this one focused on Ruby syntax and semantics.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/collected-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32070">Collected Ruby</a>: a path through many and varied topics relating to Ruby&#8217;s collection classes: Arrays, Hashes, Enumerators, etc.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/strung-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32042">Strung Ruby</a>: all about strings, searching, parsing, and regular expressions.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/async-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32148">Async Ruby</a>: a deep dive into threads and other concurrency mechanisms.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/refined-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32180">Refined Ruby</a>: the next level up from <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/crystaline-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31983">Crystaline Ruby</a> and <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/scintillating-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31963">Scintillating Ruby</a>, this path builds on your Ruby fluency to help guide your choices about how to express yourself clearly in code, how to organize your methods and classes, and how to safely evolve your designs with refactorings.</li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/domain-modeling-in-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="32207">Domain Modeling in Ruby</a>: a collection of topics on how to represent business domains in objects, options for persisting those objects to database management systems, and how to connect domain object models to the outside world.</li></ul>



<p>In combination with the garden paths already created, like <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/systems-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31756">Systems Ruby</a>, that brings us to around half of the Tapastry topics organized into courses. Each course has a new introduction, and each is internally is broken down into 2-7 modules, each with a few paragraphs of introduction.</p>



<p>I hope to have the rest of the episode history organized in the next few weeks!</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to on the site. I hope you&#8217;ll take a wander down the new garden paths, and let me know what you think and if you see anything out-of-place.</p>



<p>Stay graceful,</p>



<p>Avdi</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A module on low-level file I/O added to the systems Ruby course, and some changes to how content access works.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hi there graceful devs, here’s what’s new!</p>



<h2>Content Updates</h2>



<p><strong>More Systems Ruby: </strong>I did some poking around in the archives, and was reminded of some more content that belongs in the Systems Ruby course. There’s now a 7-part section on <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/systems-ruby/modules/efficient-file-access-reimplementing-unix-tail/">working efficiently with Ruby’s low-level file I/O APIs</a>, using a reimplementation of the UNIX <code>tail</code> command as an example. I’d totally forgotten about that series, and I’m excited to highlight it in this way. Not only will you learn more about file I/O, but you’ll see an example of iteratively encapsulating procedural code into OO abstractions.</p>



<h2>Feature Updates</h2>



<h3>New content-gating behavior</h3>



<p>My philosophy for building Graceful.Dev has been&nbsp;to leverage off-the-shelf code for 99% of the solution, and write the 1% of customization and glue code that makes it work “just right”. Towards that end, the site is build on a foundation of WordPress, the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/">LearnDash</a> Learning Management System plugin, and a symbiotic combination of <a href="https://wpfusion.com/">WP Fusion</a> and <a href="https://memberpress.com/">MemberPress</a> for managing memberships and content access.</p>



<p>One area where this has fallen slightly short of &#8220;just right&#8221; is in how LearnDash handles attempts to read course topics when you don’t have access (either because you’re logged-out, or because you don’t have the right course product or membership). By default, you get redirected to the course home page.</p>



<p>That’s not the experience I want. If someone follows a link to a Graceful.Dev topic (either from a third-party site, or from being redirected from the old RubyTapas site), I want it to behave like the RubyTapas site did: show an excerpt, and a note about how to get access (register, log in, join, etc.).</p>



<p>Anyway, long story short, I’ve added some customizations to the site to make it do just that: now if you don’t have access to a piece of content, you’ll see an excerpt and a notification about how to get access. This is a step toward my long-term goal of retiring content from the RubyTapas site: it enables the old episodes to redirect directly to their corresponding Graceful.Dev topics.</p>



<h3>New Pro membership behavior</h3>



<p>I’m still getting the hang of how to code “with the grain” of this tech stack. Originally, the way Pro membership worked was there was a group of “premium” courses that you’d get automatically enrolled in when you joined. Maintaining this course-group was a bit of a hassle, though, and a few thousand callbacks would get fired every time a new course was added to that group.</p>



<p>More recently, I made some changes so that Pro members could self-enroll in premium courses. This didn’t pan out as well as I’d expected, however; it confused several users and could make it look like you’d lost your course progress. It also turned out to have some hinky edge-cases, because it was effectively routing around how LearnDash normally thinks about course access.</p>



<p>So, after some more research, I’ve once again made a change to how Pro membership works. It now uses a built-in LearnDash feature called “auto-enrollment”. If you’re a Pro member (either directly or through a RubyTapas legacy account) you will once again be considered by the system to be enrolled in all courses. I no longer have to maintain a fixed list of “pro courses”, however. And staying “with the grain” means even less customization code to maintain.</p>



<p>Sorry about any confusion along the way!</p>



<h3>Video script and code now in tabs</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve reworked the &#8220;video script and code&#8221; to make better use of the site theme and show that content in a tab, instead of behind a fold-out at the bottom of the post.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="599" height="221" src="https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-31868" srcset="https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-2.png 599w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-2-300x111.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></figure>



<h3>Fixed some styling regressions</h3>



<p>A major version update to the LearnDash plugin introduced some visual regressions with the site&#8217;s theme. Since the update didn&#8217;t add any features or fixes I needed, I&#8217;ve downgraded it back to the 3.x series until theme support catches up.</p>



<h3>A faster site</h3>



<p>Cloudways hosting continues to pay off in terms of making it very easy (and relatively inexpensive) to experiment with different instance sizes and compare performance. After some experimentation I&#8217;ve bumped up the server instance size again and upped request memory limits. I&#8217;m seeing a more responsive site as a result and hopefully you will too.</p>



<p>That’s it for this edition. Stay graceful!</p>



<p>— Avdi</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there graceful devs, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new! Content Updates Systems Ruby Course: The other day a Graceful.Dev member in my discord asked about spawning subprocesses&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hi there graceful devs, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new!</p>



<h2>Content Updates</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/systems-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31756">Systems Ruby Course</a></strong>: The other day a Graceful.Dev member in my discord asked about spawning subprocesses in Ruby and I was like &#8220;oh, I think I have a whole series on that, let me find them for you&#8221;. Half an hour later, I came back with <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/systems-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="31756">this systems ruby course</a>. It&#8217;s all about interfacing with the operating system: controlling, monitoring, and communicating with subprocesses, allocating temp files, even calling out to system libraries. </li><li><strong><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/acapa/modules/content/topic/abapa-chapter25/" data-type="sfwd-topic" data-id="31701">A Course About Project Automation, Chapter 25</a>: </strong>In which we use a Rake automation as a &#8220;persistent notebook&#8221; to explore a REST API.</li></ul>



<p>Pulling together the <em>Systems Ruby </em>course in a matter of minutes was the fruition of countless hours of labor over the past year, migrating the RubyTapas content library to an industrial-strength courseware platform. Graceful.Dev is now at a point I&#8217;ve been dreaming of for many years: at long last, pruning and gardening the archives (as well as new material) into guided learning paths is quick and painless. You can expect lots more extracted courses where that one came from. Suggestions for where to start are welcome!</p>



<p>Proliferating courses did pose one problem, however: up &#8217;til now, the way Pro membership worked was that you would automatically be enrolled in <em>all</em> courses. That was never ideal, and it would have been  increasingly unwieldy the more courses we added. Which brings me to&#8230;</p>



<h2>Feature Updates</h2>



<ul><li>Pro Members will no longer be auto-enrolled into courses. If you&#8217;re a Pro member, you can now <em>self-enroll</em> into any course they want.</li></ul>



<p>You&#8217;ll remain enrolled in any courses you were enrolled in at the time of the change. I <em>may</em> run some cleanup sometime in the next few weeks, un-enrolling Pro members from courses they have 0% progress in. I think it would be both more useful to members and more meaningful for my own stats to narrow enrollment down to just the folks who are actually studying a given course. Of course, as a Pro member you&#8217;ll always be able to re-enroll into any courses you want to start.</p>



<p>This change involved some platform customization and there are probably edge cases I missed, so let me know if you run into any wonkiness. I&#8217;ll add the ability to self-unenroll soon. Until then you can always <a href="/contact">ask to be unenrolled</a> if you want to de-clutter your &#8220;My Courses&#8221; view.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Talk to you soon!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Join Nate Berkopec and me for a crash course in Rails performance diagnostics! Also, site speed improvements.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hi there graceful devs, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new!</p>



<h2>Content Updates</h2>



<p><strong>Robuster Ruby:</strong> After a long hiatus, I am <em>super</em> psyched to announce that the <em><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/robust-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="25656"><strong>Robust Ruby</strong></a></em> course is now complete. Capping it off are <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/robust-ruby/modules/bonus-rails-performance-diagnostics-with-nate-berkopec/">four brand new videos </a>with the renowned Ruby/Rails performance expert <a href="https://www.speedshop.co/">Nate Berkopec</a>! A couple weeks ago we sat down virtually, and he walked me through how he instruments a Rails application and identifies opportunities for optimization. We&#8217;ve edited these recordings into <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/robust-ruby/modules/bonus-rails-performance-diagnostics-with-nate-berkopec/">four screencasts</a>, packed full of hard-earned optimization knowhow. </p>



<p>So if you haven&#8217;t checked out <em><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/robust-ruby/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="25656">Robust Ruby</a> yet</em>, now is a great time to dive in! And even if you&#8217;ve already gone though the main portion of the course, make sure you check out these new chapters. Like all my RubyTapas-extracted courses, <em>Robust Ruby</em> is a bit of a grab bag. But I think anyone working on Ruby code for a living will find something in there to help make their code more observable, speedy, and industrial-strength.</p>



<h2>Feature Updates</h2>



<ul><li>I&#8217;ve made a bunch of small changes to make the site a bit more performant. </li><li>I&#8217;m experimenting with switching on per-user caching for members. If you see anything getting wonky, please <a href="https://graceful.dev/contact/" data-type="page" data-id="25635">let me know</a>! </li><li>The live chat support badge is gone for the time being, because it was slowing down pages. Let me know if you want it&#8212;or something like it&#8212;back!</li></ul>



<p>And that&#8217;s all for now. Cheers,</p>



<p>&#8212; Avdi</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I asked, you answered! Here's what Graceful.Dev members say Avdi should focus on in 2022...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey there graceful devs,</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s site news update is dedicated entirely to a look at the results of the <a href="https://graceful.dev/focus-survey-2022/" data-type="page" data-id="31466">Focus Survey</a> I mailed out last week. I asked what y&#8217;all, the members, would most like to see me focus on next, and you answered!</p>



<p>Specifically, 41 of you answered. Let&#8217;s see what you had to say&#8230;</p>



<h2 id="what-broad-area-should-avdi-focus-on-next">What broad area should Avdi focus on next?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td>Item</td><td>Total Score&nbsp;</td><td>Aggregate Rank&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>New courses on new topics not covered before</td><td>173</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Extracting cohesive, topical courses from The Tapastry</td><td>149</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Adding content to existing courses</td><td>133</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Site features/improvements</td><td>86</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Growing the community/social aspect</td><td>74</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The first thing I take away from this result is that <strong>(almost) nobody cares about social features.</strong> This is actually great to know, because it means that&#8217;s one area I <em>don&#8217;t </em>need to think about for a while. Good signal!</p>



<p>The second thing is that while there are still some nice-to-have feature requests, my sense that the site basically <em>works</em> for people seems confirmed. </p>



<p>&#8220;New courses&#8221; and &#8220;extracting courses&#8221; ran neck-and-neck for a while, but &#8220;new courses&#8221; eventually pulled ahead. I&#8217;ll be honest, I have a personal preference to spend some time teasing courses out of the Tapastry, because that&#8217;s been on my mental want-to-do list for, like, half a decade. So I may still start out with that. But I hear you loud and clear: new courses, on new topics!</p>



<p>And what new topics might those be? Well, let&#8217;s see how you answered&#8230;</p>



<h2 id="what-potential-topics-would-you-love-to-see-covered">What potential topics would you love to see covered?</h2>



<p>I threw a couple dozen potential topics at the wall. Every single one got at least one vote. The top five were:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Tackling Technical Debt</strong>. This was a pitch from <a href="https://chelseatroy.com">Chelsea Troy</a>, based on a workshop she teaches. I&#8217;ll be conferring with her soon on next steps to make this course a reality&#8230;</li><li><strong>Domain-Driven Design:</strong> I&#8217;m pretty excited to see this one come out so high up! My Graceful.Dev co-conspirator <a href="https://jessitron.com">Jessitron</a> has been teaching DDD workshops with <em>Domain-Driven Design</em> author (and our friend) Eric Evans, so I think we can probably put something together for this topic.</li><li><strong>MORE RUBY DANGIT</strong>: Hahaha OK I hear you 😁</li><li><strong>Actors, events, and reactive design</strong> and <strong>Resilience Patterns</strong>: A tie, which feels appropriate since I think they are heavily interrelated.</li><li><strong>Analyzing Risk in a Software System</strong>: Another Chelsea Troy pitch, based on one of her workshops.</li></ol>



<p>The big takeaway here is that Graceful.Dev members are more interested in design and method than in programming languages. Good to know!</p>



<p>However, for my own edification as a programming language dork, I&#8217;m going to narrow it down to the just the language-specific options and see what came out on top:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Elixir</strong> with 11 votes. This pairs well with &#8220;actors, events, and reactive design&#8221;.</li><li><strong>Rust</strong> with 10 votes.</li><li><strong>Grokking JavaScript Asynchrony</strong>, also with 10 votes. I threw this in because it&#8217;s the topic of a series of videos Betsy Haibel and I worked on, but never finished. With 25% of responders were interested, it may be worth dusting off that footage!</li><li><strong>Modern JavaScript</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>Go</strong> each got 7 votes.</li></ol>



<h2 id="which-course-in-progress-do-you-want-to-see-more-of">Which course-in-progress do you want to see more of?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="415" src="https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-1-1024x415.png" alt="" class="wp-image-31523" srcset="https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-1-1024x415.png 1024w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-1-300x122.png 300w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-1-768x311.png 768w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-1-1536x623.png 1536w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-1-624x253.png 624w, https://graceful.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-1.png 1995w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>There was a clear winner here: systems thinking! This makes me happy, since it&#8217;s what I spend a lot of my time thinking about these days. It&#8217;s also the topic of a series of workshops <a href="https://systemsthinking.dev/">Jessitron has been co-teaching with Kent Beck</a>, so I think more content in that vein should be doable.</p>

<p>I read you loud and clear on this one: stick with the tried-and-true RubyTapas format of video-centric topics!</p>



<h2 id="specific-feedback">Specific feedback</h2>



<p>The survey contained several prompts for elaboration. Some highlights and commentary, in no order:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Categorized search results</strong>: oooh, good idea. </li><li><strong>Rails 7 frontend (Hotwire/Stimulus/etc.)</strong> hmmm I might know someone who could do justice to this topic&#8230;</li><li><strong>Check off a course as done</strong>: yeah that should be do-able.</li><li><strong>A course on setting up deployment:</strong> oh yeah I like this idea. With a YAML YAML here and a YAML YAML there, here a YAML there a YAML everywhere a YAML error&#8230;</li><li><strong>A weekly email with a pointer to a random topic</strong>: YES! We used to have a &#8220;from the freezer&#8221; series, and I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about re-establishing something like it.</li><li>Although &#8220;social&#8221; did not do well in the overall focus section, a couple of people brought up doing regular Twitch-style streams.</li><li><strong>High-productivity workflows, ensemble programming: </strong>Hm, how about a series on how everyone is doing code review wrong?</li><li><strong>More on testing and TDD:</strong> Yeah I should have included that in my list of potential topics. </li><li><strong>Functional Programming: </strong>Good idea!</li></ul>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a <em>plan</em> per se, but the results of this survey have given me some solid direction. The results have been super enlightening, and I really appreciate some of the kind notes some of y&#8217;all included. </p>



<p>Thanks again to everyone who filled in the survey! If you didn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re still welcome to <a href="https://graceful.dev/focus-survey-2022/" data-type="page" data-id="31466">add your two cents</a>&#8211;I&#8217;ll continue to reference back to it as I prioritize my work going forwards.</p>



<p>Cheers,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey there graceful devs, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new!</p>



<h2 id="content-updates">Content Updates</h2>



<ul><li><strong><em><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/introduction-to-observability/" data-type="sfwd-courses" data-id="29205">Introduction to Observability</a></em></strong>, by<strong> </strong>Jessica &#8220;Jessitron&#8221; Kerr, is ready to take you from zero to competent in using Honeycomb to learn from your production code. There&#8217;s still more content and polish to come (we do living courses around here, after all&#8230;), but if you&#8217;ve been holding off waiting for it to be more fill-in, now is a great time to dive in!</li><li><strong>Systems Thinking: </strong>Speaking of Jessitron, the other day she had an idea for a topic that didn&#8217;t fit into any of our existing categories. So, please welcome the <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/systems-thinking-for-software-developers/"><em>Systems Thinking for Software Developers</em> </a>course to the fold. First topic: <em><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/systems-thinking-for-software-developers/modules/symmathesizing/topic/construct-shared-understanding-together/">construct shared understanding together</a>.</em> If you want to see more in this vein, let us know!</li></ul>



<h2 id="site-improvements">Site Improvements</h2>



<ul><li><strong>New host, who dis</strong>: A major concern in rolling out Graceful.Dev as a successor to RubyTapas et al was a) to pick a new, beefier host; and moreover b) to have the procedures and competency to shift site hosts without a lot of drama should the need arise again. This has paid off: as of Sunday the 6th, Graceful.Dev is now hosted by <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/">Cloudways</a>. I don&#8217;t want to make too many forward-looking statements about brand-new hosting, but a lot of research and trialing went into settling on them, and my onboarding experience has been excellent so far.</li><li><strong>Pro membership discounts for course buyers</strong>: a few people have asked me if there will be discounts for course buyers to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to a full Pro membership. This is now a thing: if you&#8217;re a single-course owner and you use your profile menu to go to the <a href="https://graceful.dev/special-offers/" data-type="page" data-id="30946">Special Offers</a> page, you should see a special membership offer based on your course ownership.</li><li><strong>Handier search: </strong>this one&#8217;s small &#8211; you can now search the whole site straight from the course-mode sidebar:</li></ul>

<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Stay graceful,</p>

  "content":"\n<p>I've been a heavy user of Twitter over the last decade, and while\n      Musk's purchase of Twitter hasn't got me running for the exit, it has\n      prompted me to take a look at possible alternatives should Twitter change\n      into something no longer worthwhile for me. The obvious alternative is for\n      me to explore the fediverse with a Mastodon account. As I explore using\n      Mastodon, I'll make some notes here so that others can learn from my\n      explorations.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"more\" href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-mastodon.html\">moreâ€¦</a></p>"

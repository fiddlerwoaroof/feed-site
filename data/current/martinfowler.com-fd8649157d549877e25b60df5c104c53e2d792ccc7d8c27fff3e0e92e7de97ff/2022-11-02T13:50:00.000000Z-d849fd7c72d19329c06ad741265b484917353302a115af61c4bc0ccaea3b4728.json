  "content":"\n<p>One of the main things I wanted to do with Mastodon was to replicate my\n      twitter feed there, so that folks who would rather follow me on Mastodon\n      could get everything. To do this, I used <a href=\"https://moa.party\">moa.party</a>.\n      You have to give it credentials to access both your Twitter and Mastodon\n      feeds, which is a little worrisome, but my Mastodon-aware colleagues have\n      used it without problems. It allows cross-posting in either or both\n      directions, but I've set it up to just go from Twitter to Mastodon. It's\n      pretty simple and seems to be working. So if you'd like to follow my\n      twitter feed from Mastodon, you can now do so.</p>\n\n<p>I'll be monitoring the follower count for the Mastodon account. If lots\n      of people follow me on Mastodon, I'll probably do more with it. So\n      following my Mastodon feed is vote for me to put more effort into it. But\n      for the moment, I expect it to be a simple copy of what I post on\n      Twitter.</p>"

<blockquote>
  <p>You have been permanently banned from participating in r/ruby (because of your writing off / outside of r/ruby).
I do not see your participation adding anything to this community.</p>

  <p>– Richard Schneeman (r/ruby Mod)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard Schneeman sends on r/ruby where I have myself
self-censored because of an anti-crypto mob (the irony is that I am a
crypto-critic - by the way - and try to educate with code examples the
absurdity of it all and so on) and haven’t posted anything for weeks -
yes, a permanent ban (because of a posting off / outside of r/ruby).</p>

<p>And to restate again and again I am not the poster of the
(harmless) joke. I was asking for (more) tolerance.</p>

<p>Anyways, for the record let’s post the “out-of-the-blue” (private) message 
of the r/ruby ban sent by Richard Schneeman (the “lead” / “head” r/ruby Mod):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have been permanently banned from participating in r/ruby.
You can still view and subscribe to r/ruby, but you won’t be able
 to post or comment.</p>

  <p>Note from the moderators:</p>

  <p>Yesterday I [Richard Schneeman] spoke with the mods on giving you a warning based on your
behavior on the ruby-talk mailing list. I believe you listened to my feedback and
stopped posting about crypto.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Editor’s Note - I self-censored, that is, I deleted all last postings on r/ruby and stopped posting altogether for weeks now.
I even archived more than a dozen postings at a new reddit - see <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/planetruby/">r/planetruby</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So we decided to make explicit where we sit <strong>regarding things that happen off of r/ruby reddit</strong>.</p>

  <p>Today I [Richard Schneeman] see you posting this [on the ruby-talk mailing list]
<a href="https://rubytalk.org/t/political-thought-leader-on-the-threat-from-the-illiberal-left-don-t-underestimate-the-danger-of-left-leaning-identity-politics/75583">Political thought - Leader on the threat from the illiberal left - Don’t underestimate the danger of left-leaning identity politics.</a> 
I see that someone said that a joke was harmful to them. I’m disgusted reading the joke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Editor’s Note -  The joke has been posted by a ruby newbie (yes, someone else).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m frustrated for my community. I see my co-workers face sexist remarks, and I see them burning out and quitting the programming community. 
I need programming and especially Ruby, to be inclusive and welcoming. I need programmers not to intentionally post harmful and hateful content.</p>

  <p>I see others have already warned you several times against this behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Editor’s Note - Warning about what? About have a different opinion!? 
It’s a debate / discussion. Learn to respect different opinions / view points.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It does not appear those warnings produced a meaningful
 change in your behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How absurd. Meanigful change in your behavior. I am asking for
tolerance and for sure that is not negotiable.</p>

<p>Anyways, not expecting any meaningful change from Richard
Schneeman. To repost my answer for the record:</p>

<p>If you read the thread I am NOT - repeat with me - I am NOT the poster of the
joke. I am asking for tolerance. But reading your
comments above it looks like you are [- sorry to say - an extreme illiberal fanatic leftie] on a “mission”. You are targeting
the wrong random nobody (and remember every action will have reactions
and so on). And I thought you are acting in good faith [(when looking into how some haters game the r/ruby reddit 
with downvotes and flagging all post of targets as spam and so on)]. Helas.</p>

<p>How can a posting about a joke (that I didn’t post) on ruby-talk lead to a ban on r/ruby?</p>

<p>Yes, a clear case for out-of-control cancel culture power abuse.</p>

<p>Yes, I undestand - you, that is, Richard Schneeman  want to “signal” to your friends and co-workers how ultra / extreme leftie and righteous 
you are.</p>

<p>Now - put yourself in my shoes - you see - taking the “unpopular” side and asking for more tolerance 
and standing up to the call-out about basically nothing (see the “joke” below) - how does that make you look
to your self-righteous leftie friends and co-worker, eh?</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What was the joke (I think most of us don’t know it)?</p>

<p>The insanity of it all - here is the posting (not mine as stated before) <a href="https://rubytalk.org/t/simple-operations/75577">from the archive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello,</p>

  <p>Another example - perhaps somebody could fix that
(many errors have that source!)</p>

  <p>Date.today</p>

  <p>Date.today +1 # no error, but wrong result!</p>

  <p># Maybe this has been written for women, having calculated their age :wink:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that’s all the drama.
Note the last line (above) a harmless statement about the vanity of older women (lying or being shy about their age or such).</p>

  "content":"\n<p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During September, our work was supported by <a href=\"https://zendesk.com\">Zendesk</a> and many others.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-central-news\">Ruby Central News</h2>\n\n<p>We are excited to announce that the German government’s <a href=\"https://sovereigntechfund.de/en.html\">Sovereign Tech Fund</a> has chosen RubyGems and Bundler to participate in their pilot round of funding for open source infrastructure maintenance and development. We’re excited to invest further in the RubyGems open source ecosystem with help from the STF.</p>\n\n<p>In September, Ruby Central’s open source work was supported by 33 different companies, including Ruby member <a href=\"https://zendesk.com\">Zendesk</a>. 1 company joined as a new member.</p>\n\n<p>On top of those companies, 1 new developer, Kuba =)K, signed up as a member! In total, we were supported by 122 developer members. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">RubyGems News</h2>\n\n<p>This month in RubyGems, we released RubyGems <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3322--2022-09-07\">v3.3.22</a> and Bundler <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2322-september-7-2022\">v2.3.22</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The following improvements and fixes are also included in these releases (see the changelog for more information):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>added <code>bundle-console</code> command in Bundler’s documentation - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5901\">#5901</a>.</li>\n  <li>updated the Bundler metadata source code URI for accuracy in gemspec - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5896\">#5896</a>.</li>\n  <li>removed warning for old TLS version connections - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5928\">#5928</a>.</li>\n  <li>removed no longer needed <code>fiddle</code> hacks since RubyInstaller released patch versions to not load <code>fiddle</code> on boot - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5902\">#5902</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, this month we’ve been working on migrating Bundler’s internal resolver engine to use <a href=\"https://nex3.medium.com/pubgrub-2fb6470504f\">PubGrub</a>, the cutting edge dependency resolution algorithm developed by Sass and Dart maintainer @nex3, and <a href=\"https://github.com/jhawthorn/pub_grub\">ported to Ruby</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/jhawthorn\">@jhawthorn</a>. Our progress so far includes better error messages and several cases of dramatically faster resolutions. We hope to release this work soon.</p>\n\n<p>We have also removed the feature of auto-sudo’ing when there are not enough permissions to perform certain operations, because it could potentially run commands as root without prompting the user. The feature existed exclusively for the Ruby built in to macOS, but caused problems elsewhere. Since Apple has announced they plan to stop shipping Ruby with macOS in the future, it seemed like a good time to remove the feature. This removal will be released with Bundler 2.4.0</p>\n\n<p>In September, RubyGems and Bundler gained <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/master@%7B2022-09-01%7D...master@%7B2022-09-31%7D\">94 new commits</a>, contributed by 19 authors. There were 1,678 additions and 1,869 deletions across 161 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">RubyGems.org News</h2>\n\n<p>In September, RubyGems.org saw several bug fixes and updates, some of which include the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>added <code>rake task</code> to migrate MFA <code>ui_only</code> users to <code>ui_and_gem_signin</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3217\">#3217</a>.</li>\n  <li>fixed MFA status label on owners index page - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3206\">#3206</a>.</li>\n  <li>added a fix to include missing i18n API Keys - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3208\">#3208</a>.</li>\n  <li>implemented a fix to allow users to delete all scoped <code>API keys</code> on password reset - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3202\">#3202</a>.</li>\n  <li>added recommended <code>to_utf8</code> method when comparing certificates subject - <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3197\">#3197</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This month, RubyGems gained <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/compare/master@%7B2022-09-01%7D...master@%7B2022-09-31%7D\">45 new commits</a>, contributed by 11 authors. There were 621 additions and 212 deletions across 65 files.</p>\n\n<p>As always, we continue to fix bugs, review and merge PRs and reply to support tickets.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"total-spent\">total spent</h2>\n\n<p>In September we completed 70.9 hours of development work @$150/hour, and spent $10,636.50.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time,<br>\nIrene, André and the Ruby Together team</p>\n\n\n"

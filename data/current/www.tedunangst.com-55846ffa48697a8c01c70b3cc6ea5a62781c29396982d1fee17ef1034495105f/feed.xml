      <title>from apples to pears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Here at Enterprising Enterprise, we love technology, but we’re also pushing it hard, constantly trying to expand the frontier of what’s possible. Along the way, we frequently find we’ve outgrown an earlier technology choice, and it’s time for us to migrate to something new. There’s a cost to doing this, but it’s the only way to keep moving forward.<p>We’ve recently decided to migrate from using apples to pears. In this post, I’ll outline some of the problems we had with apples, and then I’ll explain some of the cool things about pears that have us really excited about the future. Keep reading to learn more about our newest tech evolution.<br><h3>bad apples</h3><p>When we first started using apples, we thought they were great. And they were, for a while. But soon we began to notice problems and it’s slowing down our team. Working at our scale, even small frictions really add up.<p>The first problem you’ve probably noticed if you’re familiar with apples is they have seeds. We’ve been ignoring this for quite some time, but it’s a frequent topic of discussion. Every team standup now has a checklist item to make sure we’ve dealt with the seeds properly.<p>Another problem we’ve had with apples is their less than ideal shape. It’s convenient to imagine apples as spheres, and many teams can probably get by with this assumption, but in practice, apples are not spheres. Getting the most out of apples requires a serious investment in understanding their exact topology.<p>Apples have carried us a long way, and we’re very thankful to have had the option to use them, but it was becoming clear we should look into alternatives.<br><h3>great pears</h3><p>We looked at a great many options, but ultimately the team settled on pears. We think they’re a great match for our needs and will be able to grow with us.<p>You may have heard that pears grow on trees. This is true. And we love it! Trees are great. We’ve been able to set up entire orchards of easy to harvest pear trees.<p>We started by using pears to make pear cider, but with more experience, we’ve discovered they’re amazingly versatile. We can make pear pies as well, or even pear brandy. The flexibility offered by pears is simply amazing. It’ll be a long time before we exhaust all the possibilities.<br><h3>conclusion</h3><p>Our migration has only started, but it’s energized the entire company. The teams that have switched to pears for new projects have been super productive, and even the teams still using apples are excited to incorporate pears into their internal roadmap for the future.<p>Thanks for reading. We hope this post has offered some insight into the decisions we’ve made, and if you’re interested, I should mention we’re always hiring.]]></description>

      <title>reversing an openbsd kernel syspatch</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OpenBSD has provided binary patches for a select few architectures for a while now, to save users from the daunting task of running make on their own. Alas, this means you might now apply a patch without first reviewing it. In the olden times, you had a source patch, so obviously you meticulously studied every line before application, just like you advised new users on IRC to do. But now, who will believe you do this when the binary syspatch is right there, so easy, so tempting.<p>Ah ha, you say, I will simply tell everyone that I inspect the binary files. Excellent idea. The binary syspatch should match the changes in the source patch; after all, it comes from the same place and you’re already trusting them with just about everything else, but you get extra internet points every time you say trust but verify. Let’s dig just deep enough that we might plausibly brag to our friends, that oh yes, we totally do this for every syspatch.<br><h3>syspatch</h3><p>First, we’ll need the syspatch. These aren’t actually linked anywhere on the website, since you aren’t supposed to need them, but it’s not particularly difficult to discover where they live. For this example, I’m using syspatch71-001_wifi.tgz for the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/errata71.html">7.1 001 wifi erratum</a>. Download that, then check its certificate of authenticity. Accept no substitutes.<p><pre><code>$ signify -C -x SHA256.sig syspatch71-001_wifi.tgz 
Signature Verified
syspatch71-001_wifi.tgz: OK</code></pre><p><code>tar tzf</code> reveals it’s just a bunch of files, located somewhere in <i>/usr</i>. There’s no special structure to a syspatch. It’s literally just files that get dropped into the file system. (There’s some backup and sanity checks in the <i>syspatch</i> script, of course, but the file doesn’t require much in the way of deep inspection.)<p>zxf, preferably in a directory other than /, and we’ve got some kernel objects to inspect.<br><h3>blowfish tartare</h3><p>Our inspection will probably go a bit smoother if we have something to compare with. On a live system, you’d just look at the files in <i>/usr</i>. But if we’re offline, or whatever, we need another copy. The files should be in the base71.tgz set, but I failed to find them on my first attempt. Had to a look a little closer to realize that the kernel object files are distributed in their own kernel.tgz file. Tarception!<p>I was all set to explain how to extract files from an inner tar without extracting the whole thing, but this does not appear possible with OpenBSD tar, even with fancy fd redirection. Side quest failed. If you install the <i>gtar</i> DLC, however, there is a -O option.<p>Anyway, you run tar twice, and we’re ready to compare files.<br><h3>vers.o</h3><p>I’ll start with a very simple file, and a very simple analysis tool. There was a <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=165068240031373&amp;w=2">funny bug</a> in the first version of this syspatch where it would update the system into a nonupdateable state. A reasonable thing for us to double check. The binary syspatch <i>should</i> match the source patch, but sometimes it doesn’t. Trust, but verify.<p>I just ran <i>hexdump -C</i> and diffed the output.<p><pre><code><span class=dl>--- v0  Tue May 24 11:01:07 2022</span>

Even a tiny change like switching a <i>je</i> to <i>jne</i> instruction could have catastrophic effects. In this case, I’m pretty sure the difference relates to the two byte difference in the previous string, but we may have exhausted the potential of hexdump here.<br><h3>what</h3><p>Moving on to a real file, <i>an.o</i>, diffing hexdumps is a disaster. We need something a little more intelligent like <i>objdump</i>. The regular output of objdump isn’t very amenable to diffing, either, because even tiny changes propagate throughout the file, affecting offsets everywhere. Nothing we can’t solve with a bit of code, though.<p>This seemed like an easy bit of <i>awk</i> to write, then I read the manual. Hexadecimal numbers convert to 0. This is even mentioned as a feature! Or a bug fix. Woe to those who’d like to process hexadecimal inputs.<p>Anyway, this isn’t hard. So I wrote a little utility called <i>what</i>.

Maybe next time we’ll try using a tool that’s actually designed for binary analysis and forensics instead of banging magnetic rocks together.<p>Having realized how simple the task is, I leave you with this sed liner.<p><pre><code>function sedit { sed -E -e &#39;s/^[[:xdigit:]]+ &lt;/&lt;/&#39; -e &#39;s/^ *[[:xdigit:]]+:([[:space:]][[:xdigit:]]{2})* *//&#39; -e &#39;s/(callq?|jmpq?|ja|jb|jn?e|jge?|jn?s) +([[:xdigit:]]+)/$1/&#39; -e &#39;s/# ([[:xdigit:]]+)//&#39;; }; objdump -d base/usr/share/relink/kernel/GENERIC.MP/an.o | sedit | (exec 3&lt; /dev/stdin; objdump -d 001/usr/share/relink/kernel/GENERIC.MP/an.o | sedit | diff -u /dev/fd/3 -;)</code></pre><p>You know it’s good because it even ends with smiley.]]></description>

      <title>the trouble with q quotes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Among the underutilized HTML elements is the <code>q</code> tag, for quotes. This should, depending on user agent, render with appropriate opening and closing quote marks, without needing to specify them by hand. This sounds really convenient, to avoid ambiguity when quotes are nested inside quotes inside quotes. I said, “Alex told Bobby, “according to Chris, “Danny said “No way am I the one who’s confused,” when asked,” direct quote,” yesterday morning,” emphatically. Lucky Danny.<p>The browser might even somewhat intelligently choose pairs of quotes that alternate with each nesting. In practice, I’ve found they mostly pick double quotes for the outside, then single quotes for all inner quotes. Fortunately, we can add a custom style that defines a larger vocabulary of quote marks.<p><style style="display: block; font-family: monospace;">
q {
    quotes: "“" "”" "‘" "’" "(" ")" "``" "''";
}
span q {
    quotes: auto;
}
</style>

<p>I said, <q>Alex told Bobby, <q>according to Chris, <q>Danny said <q>No way am I the one who's confused,</q> when asked,</q> direct quote,</q> yesterday morning,</q> emphatically. I personally despise the archaic fake fancy ASCII double quotes, but nevertheless useful for demonstration purposes.

<p>Another cool trick is that the quotes can be auto selected by language. For example, I might quote <span lang=fr><q>Le 24 février 1815, la vigie de Notre-Dame de la Garde signala le trois-mâts le Pharaon, venant de Smyrne, Trieste et Naples.</q></span> in French, but it will be quoted as <span lang=en><q>On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.</q></span> in English. Alas, this only works if the stylesheet leaves the default untouched or specifies auto, necessitating the second style with the span selector above.
<p>But now comes a more serious problem. Pseudo element content is, per standard, not selectable. Not copyable. So if I highlight my quotable quotes sentence, copy it, and paste it into another application, I get varying results.<p>Edge and Safari copy the sentence without any quote marks at all: I said, Alex told Bobby, according to Chris, Danny said No way am I the one who’s confused, when asked, direct quote, yesterday morning, emphatically. Most confusing.<p>Firefox inserts double quotes for the q elements: I said, “Alex told Bobby, “according to Chris, “Danny said “No way am I the one who’s confused,” when asked,” direct quote,” yesterday morning,” emphatically. I’m not sure if that’s to spec or not, but it’s certainly more helpful. (flak makes them look pretty; the copied text contains plain straight quotes.)<p>Lynx does not support CSS, so the French quotes are less French, but it does intelligently alternate between double and single quotes for deeply nested tags. I said, “Alex told Bobby, ‘according to Chris, “Danny said ‘No way am I the one who’s confused,’ when asked,” direct quote,’ yesterday morning,” emphatically. Was that so hard?<p>I lack the web wizardry skills to fix this in a reliable fashion. I guess you’d have to insert invisible elements containing the quote characters you want copied, but I think at that point just give up and don’t even use the q element.<p>By default, the <code>blockquote</code> element does not feature such decoration, although I’ve found it nice to add. Here, the inability to select and copy the quote marks is much less troublesome, maybe even desirable.<p><blockquote>The year 1866 was marked by a bizarre development, an unexplained and downright inexplicable phenomenon that surely no one has forgotten. Without getting into those rumors that upset civilians in the seaports and deranged the public mind even far inland, it must be said that professional seamen were especially alarmed. Traders, shipowners, captains of vessels, skippers, and master mariners from Europe and America, naval officers from every country, and at their heels the various national governments on these two continents, were all extremely disturbed by the business.</blockquote><p>]]></description>

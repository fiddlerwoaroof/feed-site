  "content":"\n<p>Awards, Ivy League universities, or prestigious journals are suboptimal heuristics to evaluate people’s work, but in a world of information overflow, they influence the popularity of ideas. Therefore, I am caching in on Jason Geller’s invitation to present z-curve in the <a href=\"https://psych.princeton.edu/events/seminar-advanced-research-methods\">Advanced Research Methods seminar</a> at Princeton.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The talk was recorded and Jason and Princeton University generously shared the recording with me (<a href=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/9liB1ZFm/princeton.zcurve.22.10.11-1.mp4\">Video</a>).  The talk builds on previous talks, but incorporates the latest z-curve findings that demonstrate the power of z-curve to predict replication failures and to justify the use of alpha = .005 as a reasonable criterion for significance tests to keep the risk of false positive results in psychological journals at a reasonably low level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find many other z-curve related articles and studies on my blog. Here I want to mention only the two peer-reviewed articles that introduced the method and provide more detailed information about the method. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/874\">Estimating Population Mean Power Under Conditions of Heterogeneity and Selection for Significance</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/urgtn/\">Z-Curve 2.0: Estimating Replication Rates and Discovery Rates</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conduct your own z-curve analysis, you can use the <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zcurve/index.html\">z-curve package</a> in R. </p>\n"

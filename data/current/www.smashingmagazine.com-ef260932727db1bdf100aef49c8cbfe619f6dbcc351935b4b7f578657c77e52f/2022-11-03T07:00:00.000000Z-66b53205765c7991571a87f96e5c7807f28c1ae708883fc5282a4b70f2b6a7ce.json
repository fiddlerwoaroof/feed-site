After all, who really wants to spend more time in front of their screen? That’s exactly why we’ve <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/\">designed the online workshop experience from scratch</a>, accounting for the time needed to take in all the content, understand it and have enough time to ask <em>just</em> the right questions.</p>\n<p>Our online workshops take place <strong>live</strong> and span <strong>multiple days across weeks.</strong> They are split into 2.5h-sessions, and in every session there is always enough time to bring up your questions or just get a cup of tea. We don’t rush through the content, but instead try to create a welcoming, friendly and inclusive environment for everyone to have time to think, discuss and get feedback.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/smashing-workshop-form-design-masterclass/\">things to expect from a Smashing workshop</a>, but the most important one is focus on <strong>practical examples</strong> and techniques. The workshops aren’t talks; they are <strong>interactive</strong>, with live conversations with attendees, sometimes with challenges, homework and team work.</p>\n<p>Of course, you get all workshop materials and <strong>video recordings</strong> as well, so if you miss a session you can re-watch it the same day.</p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshops span <strong>multiple days</strong>, split in <em>2.5h-sessions</em>.</li>\n<li>Enough time for live Q&amp;A every day.</li>\n<li>Dozens of <strong>practical examples</strong> and techniques.</li>\n<li>You’ll get all workshop materials &amp; recordings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops\">All workshops</a> are focused on frontend &amp; UX.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/bundles\">Get a workshop bundle</a> and <strong>save $250</strong> off the price.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">Jump to all workshops →</a></div>\n\nBonus: Free Online Community Events\n<p>Dive deep into discussions around accessibility and design systems with our upcoming online events — <strong>free for everyone</strong>, so please do bring your friends along!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ti.to/smashingmagazine/a-smashing-hour-sara-part5?mc_cid=36446bfb1f&amp;mc_eid=bfa05a2218\">A Smashing Hour with Sara Soueidan</a>, a 1h-session speaking on everything from SVG and design systems to accessibility and pizza toppings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4893299f-d4fb-40dc-b3ef-1e27690fa520/smashing-hour-sara-s.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/meets-design-systems\">Smashing Meets on Design Systems</a>, a live event on theming and best practices around design systems.

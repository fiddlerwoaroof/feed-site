  "content":"<p>To many of us, privacy might feel like a complex, abstract concept. We can’t hold <strong>privacy</strong> in our hands, we can’t touch it, we can’t explore its volume or shape with our eyes or our fingertips. Surely it’s a <strong>part of each of us</strong>, yet it feels so intangible and so invisible — beyond reach and out of view.</p>\n<p>So what <em>is</em> privacy? What exactly does it mean? How do we consider, manage and maintain privacy? And how dow do we design and build experiences that have privacy at their heart? That’s exactly what <em>Understanding Privacy</em> is all about: a <strong>practical guide to privacy on the web</strong>, from data collection and use of personal data to creating safe, inclusive experiences for everyone. <a href=\"#table-of-contents\"><strong>Jump to table of contents ↓</strong></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>eBook now available</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Printed books</strong> start shipping in <strong>late November 2022</strong>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/eBooks/understanding-privacy/understanding-privacy-sample-chapter.pdf\">Download a free PDF sample</a> (11MB)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/printed-books/understanding-privacy/\"><strong>Get the book (Print Hardcover + eBook)</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/eBooks/understanding-privacy/understanding-privacy-sample-chapter.pdf\">\n    <img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3509bd84-1307-4bb5-a00f-1b9da09b8acb/understanding-privacy-banner-opt.png\">\n    </a>\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Book\n<p><em>Understanding Privacy</em> is a practical guide to the concepts and ideas that inform privacy on the web. It’s about all the fundamental values of privacy <em>as a concept</em>, which precede privacy <em>as a legal compliance issue</em>. It’s about the ways these concepts impact your work as a designer, a developer, or a project manager. And it’s about the ways you can adopt these principles to create a <strong>healthy, user-centric approach to privacy</strong> in everything you do.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webdevlaw.uk/about/\">Heather Burns</a>, a tech policy and regulation specialist, explains what she has experienced working on <strong>privacy from every angle</strong> — human rights, law, policy, and web development — in the simplest way possible, and in the most positive way possible, in ways you can <strong>understand, use, and adapt in your work</strong> on the web right away.</p>\n\n\n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5957a0ae-b5e1-4772-86cc-ccc8a797bb11/privacy-book-cover-tilted.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5957a0ae-b5e1-4772-86cc-ccc8a797bb11/privacy-book-cover-tilted.jpg\">\n    </a>\n\n\n\n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ee946184-9fbb-40b3-9fc0-e061e5043d6b/privacy-page-01.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ee946184-9fbb-40b3-9fc0-e061e5043d6b/privacy-page-01.jpg\">\n    </a>All chapters in the book have custom illustrations, highlighting the topic of the book.\n\n\n<p>This book is <strong>not a legal reference manual</strong>. After reading it, you will have shifted your understanding from a negative view of privacy as a scary legal compliance obligation to a <em>positive view of privacy</em> as an opportunity to build and design a better web. <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/eBooks/understanding-privacy/understanding-privacy-sample-chapter.pdf\"><strong>Download a free PDF sample</strong></a> (11MB).</p>\n\n<p><em>288 pages.

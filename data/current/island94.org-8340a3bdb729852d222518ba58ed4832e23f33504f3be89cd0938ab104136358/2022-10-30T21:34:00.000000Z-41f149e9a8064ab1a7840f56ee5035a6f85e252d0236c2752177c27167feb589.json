  "content":"<p>From Logic #17, in <a href=\"https://logicmag.io/home/the-edtech-gold-rush/\">“The Edtech Gold Rush”</a> by Kevin Miller (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>One of the companies, Imagine Learning, distinguished itself by claiming that, on their platform, students could demonstrate their knowledge of English language and literature by “com-posing a rap song or creating a TikTok.” Some students seemed intrigued. Others groaned over their laptops. Yet another edtech firm was promising to uplift marginalized students by filling the classroom with the kind of entertainment media they consumed at home.</p>\n\n  <p>Such products can make educational content more accessible, especially at home, but they cannot actually address academic shortcomings any more than pen and paper. <strong>This is because learning happens through what educators call “productive struggle,” not merely the consumption of educational content. Productive struggle is the profession’s term for problem-solving at a level that is difficult for a student, but possible with effort and limited assistance. Educators refer to this magical window of learning as the “zone of proximal development.” Any education technology that is able to employ entertainment to transcend the difficulty inherent in learning ceases to be educational.</strong></p>\n\n  <p>But even if such a technology is able to elicit productive struggle among students, it still runs up against a deeper challenge: pov-erty. The real reason that students have difficulty in the classroom is not due to the lack of thoughtful UX design, but because the trauma and instability wrought by the material circumstances of their home and community make engaging in productive struggle difficult. This does not mean that edtech products are useless. But they are not able to address the core cause of educational inequality any more than traditional instruction.</p>\n\n  <p>The recent growth in school funding from Covid relief measures gives educators a long-overdue opportunity to confront the material roots of educational inequality. But this influx of public money also represents a potential payday for a fast-growing edtech sector. The edtech market in the US is expected to grow to about $60 billion by 2026, according to an estimate from Global Industry Analysts, more than doubling its 2021 valuation and drastically outpacing the growth of the education sector as a whole. At a moment when governments are committing real resources to public education, companies touting disruptive digital approaches see a gold rush. They plan to win lucrative contracts by promising to solve a problem they can’t possibly solve.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n  <br><br>\n  <hr>\n  <p>\n    This post, <em><a href=\"https://island94.org/2022/10/productive-struggle\">Productive Struggle</a></em>, is published on <a href=\"https://island94.org\">Island94.org</a>.\n    Tweet me at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bensheldon\">@bensheldon</a> to discuss it.\n  </p>\n"

It goes in depth into the Quicksort algorithm. We compare implementations in Haskell and Python, and also consider what it really means for us to have an &quot;In Place&quot; algorithm that mutates our data.\nI've written about this topic before, so check out these articles if you prefer written content!\n\nMutable Arrays\nQuicksort\n\nBut this new video includes some neat visuals showing Quicksort in action, so check it out!\nAll the code in the video is visible on Github as well!\nIf you like this content, make sure to subscribe to our mailing list!\n    "

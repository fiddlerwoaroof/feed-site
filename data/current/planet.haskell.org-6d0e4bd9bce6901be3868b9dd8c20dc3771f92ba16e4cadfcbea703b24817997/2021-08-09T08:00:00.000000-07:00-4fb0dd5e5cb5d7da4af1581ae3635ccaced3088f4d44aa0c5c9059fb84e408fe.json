Tonight, I'll be trying out a new form of content. I'll be streaming myself writing some Haskell. This will likely be a weekly event for quite a while. To see some Haskell in action, head to our Twitch Stream page from 7:30 PM until 9:30 PM Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7).\nTonight's focus will be on updating Haskellings to use a library for file paths instead of its current custom system. The next few weeks will probably also be centered around Haskellings, but I'll also venture into some areas, like trying out some example coding problems with Haskell. I'll also change around the streaming time to give a chance to followers from around the world.\nSo don't miss out, head to our Twitch page, follow us, and tune in tonight at 7:30!\n    "

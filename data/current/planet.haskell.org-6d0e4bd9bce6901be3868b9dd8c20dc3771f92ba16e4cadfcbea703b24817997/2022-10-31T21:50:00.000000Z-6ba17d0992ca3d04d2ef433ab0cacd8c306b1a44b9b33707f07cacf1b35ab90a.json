  "content":"Content warning: something here to offend almost everyone\n\nA while back I complained that there were no emoji portraits of\nU.S. presidents.  Not that there a\nChesterÂ A. Arthur portrait would see a lot of use.  But some of the\nothers might come in handy.\n\nI couldn't figure them all out.  I have no idea what a Chester Arthur\nemoji would look like.  And I assigned \nğŸ§”ğŸ�» \nto all three of Garfield,\nHarrison, and Hayes, which I guess is ambiguous but do you really need to be able\nto tell the difference between Garfield, Harrison, and Hayes?  I don't\nthink you do.  But I'm pretty happy with most of the rest.\n\n\n    George Washington  ğŸ’µ\n    John Adams  \n    Thomas Jefferson  ğŸ“œ\n    James Madison  \n    James Monroe  \n    John Quincy Adams  ğŸ��\n    Andrew Jackson  \n    Martin Van Buren  ğŸŒ·\n    William Henry Harrison  ğŸª¦\n    John Tyler  \n    James K. Polk  \n    Zachary Taylor  \n    Millard Fillmore  â›½\n    Franklin Pierce  \n    James Buchanan  \n    Abraham Lincoln  ğŸ�­\n    Andrew Johnson  ğŸ’©\n    Ulysses S. Grant  ğŸ�¸\n    Rutherford B. Hayes  ğŸ§”ğŸ�»\n    James Garfield  ğŸ§”ğŸ�»\n    Chester A. Arthur  \n    Grover Cleveland  ğŸ”‚\n    Benjamin Harrison  ğŸ§”ğŸ�»\n    Grover Cleveland  ğŸ”‚\n    William McKinley  \n    Theodore Roosevelt  ğŸ§¸\n    William Howard Taft  ğŸ›�\n    Woodrow Wilson  ğŸ�“\n    Warren G. Harding  ğŸ«–\n    Calvin Coolidge  ğŸ™Š\n    Herbert Hoover  â›º\n    Franklin D. Roosevelt  ğŸ‘¨â€�ğŸ¦½\n    Harry S. Truman  ğŸ�„\n    Dwight D. Eisenhower  ğŸª–\n    John F. Kennedy  ğŸ�†\n    Lyndon B. Johnson  ğŸ—³ï¸�\n    Richard M. Nixon  ğŸ�›\n    Gerald R. Ford  ğŸ�ˆ\n    Jimmy Carter  ğŸ¥œ\n    Ronald Reagan  ğŸ’¸\n    George H. W. Bush  ğŸ‘»\n    William J. Clinton  ğŸ�·\n    George W. Bush  ğŸ‘�\n    Barack Obama  ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡ª\n    Donald J. Trump  ğŸ�Š\n    Joseph R. Biden ğŸ•¶ï¸�\n\n\nHonorable mention: Benjamin Franklin ğŸª�\n\nDishonorable mention: J. Edgar Hoover ğŸ‘š\n\nIf anyone has better suggestions I'm glad to hear them.  Note that I\nconsidered, and rejected ğŸ�© for Lincoln because it doesn't look like\nhis actual hat.  And I thought maybe McKinley should be ğŸ�”ï¸� but since\nthey changed the name of the mountain back I decided to save it in\ncase we ever elect a President Denali.\n\n(Thanks to Liam Damewood for suggesting Harding, and to Colton Jang\nfor Clinton's saxophone.)\n\n[ Addendum 20221106: Twitter user Simon suggests emoji for UK prime ministers.Â ]\n\n[ Addendum 20221108: Rasmus Villemoes makes a good suggestion of ğŸ˜¼ for Garfield. \nI had\nconsidered this angle, but abandoned it because there was no way to be\nsure that the cat would be orange, overweight, or grouchy.\nAlso the \nğŸ§”ğŸ�»\nthing is funnier the more it is used.\nBut I had been unaware that there is CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE until M.Â Villemoes\nbrought it to my attention, so maybe.\n(Had there been an emoji resembling a lasagna I would have chosen it instantly.)Â ]\n\n[ Addendum 20221108: January First-of-May has suggested ğŸŒ· \nfor Maarten van Buren, a Dutch-American whose first language was\nnot English but Dutch.  Let it be so!Â ]\n    "

  "content":"GHC 9.4.3 released\nbgamari - 2022-11-03\n\nThe GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.4.3. Binary\ndistributions, source distributions, and documentation are available at\ndownloads.haskell.org.\nThis release is primarily a bugfix release addressing a few issues\nfound in 9.4.2. These include:\n\nAn issue where recursively calls could be speculatively evaluated, resulting\nin non-termination (#20836)\nA code generation issue in the AArch64 native code generator backend\nresulting in incorrect runtime results in some circumstances (#22282)\nA crash on Darwin when running executables compiled with IPE support (#22080)\nA long-standing interface-file determinism issue where full paths would leak\ninto the interface file (#22162)\nA bug in the process library where file handles specified as NoStream would\nstill be usable in the child (process#251)\n\nNote that, as GHC 9.4 is the first release series where the release artifacts\nare all generated by our new Hadrian build system, it is possible that there\nwill be packaging issues. If you enounter trouble while using a binary\ndistribution, please open a ticket. Likewise, if you are a downstream\npackager, do consider migrating to Hadrian to run your build; the Hadrian\nbuild system can be built using cabal-install, stack, or the in-tree\nbootstrap script. See the accompanying blog post for details on\nmigrating packaging to Hadrian.\nWe would also like to emphasize that GHC 9.4 must be used in conjunction with\nCabal-3.8 or later. This is particularly important for Windows users due to\nchanges in GHCâ€™s Windows toolchain.\nWe would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,\nWell-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell Foundation, and\nother anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind support has\nfacilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the years. Finally,\nthis release would not have been possible without the hundreds of open-source\ncontributors whose work comprise this release.\nAs always, do give this release a try and open a ticket if you see\nanything amiss.\nHappy Haskelling,\n\nBen\n\n    "

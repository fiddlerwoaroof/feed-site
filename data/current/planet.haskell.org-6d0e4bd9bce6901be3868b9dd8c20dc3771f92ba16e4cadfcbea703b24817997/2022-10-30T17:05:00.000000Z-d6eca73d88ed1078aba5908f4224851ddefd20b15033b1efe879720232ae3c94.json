  "content":"A while back, discussing Vladimir Putin\n(not putain) I said\n\n\n  In English we don't seem to be so quivery.\n  Plenty of people are named “Hoare”.\n  If someone makes a joke about the homophone, people will just\n  conclude that they're a boor.\n\n\nToday I remembered Frances Trollope and her\nson Anthony Trollope. Where does the name\ncome from?  Surely it's not occupational?\n\nHappily no, just another coincidence.\nAccording to Wikipedia it is a toponym, referring to\na place called Troughburn in Northumberland, which was originally\nknown as Trolhop, “troll valley”.\nSir Andrew Trollope is known to have had the\nname as long ago as 1461.\n\nAccording to the Times of London,\nJoanna Trollope, a 6th-generation descendant\nof Frances, once recalled\n\n\n  a night out with a “very prim and proper” friend who had the surname\n  Hoare. The friend was dismayed by the amusement she caused in the\n  taxi office when she phoned to book a car for Hoare and Trollope. \n\n\nI guess the common name &quot;Hooker&quot; is\noccupational, perhaps originally referring to a fisherman.\n\n[ Frances Trollope previously on this blog: [1]\n [2] ]\n\n[ Addendum: (Wiktionary says that Hooker is occupational, a person who makes hooks.  I find it surprising that this would be a separate occupattion.  And what kind of hooks?  I will try to look into this later. ]\n    "

  "content":"GHC 9.2.5 is now available\nZubin Duggal - 2022-11-07\n\nThe GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.2.5. Binary\ndistributions, source distributions, and documentation are available at\ndownloads.haskell.org.\nThis release is primarily a bugfix release addressing a few issues\nfound in 9.2.4. These include:\n\nCode generation issues in the AArch64 native code generator backend\nresulting in incorrect runtime results in some circumstances (#22282, #21964)\nFixes for a number of issues with the simplifier leading to core lint\nerrors and suboptimal performance (#21694, #21755, #22114)\nA long-standing interface-file determinism issue where full paths would leak\ninto the interface file (#22162)\nA runtime system bug where creating empty mutable arrays resulted in a crash\n(#21962)\nâ€¦ and a few more. See the release notes for a full accounting.\n\nAs some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are encouraged to\nupgrade promptly.\nWe would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,\nWell-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell Foundation, and\nother anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind support has\nfacilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the years. Finally,\nthis release would not have been possible without the hundreds of open-source\ncontributors whose work comprise this release.\nAs always, do give this release a try and open a ticket if you see\nanything amiss.\nHappy compiling,\n\nZubin\n\n    "

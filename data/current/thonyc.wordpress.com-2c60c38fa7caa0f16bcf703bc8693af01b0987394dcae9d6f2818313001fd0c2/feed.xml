<p></p>



<p>Due to the impact of Isaac Newton and the mathematicians grouped around him, people often have a false impression of the role that England played in the history of the mathematical sciences during the Early Modern Period. As I have noted in the past, during the late medieval period and on down into the seventeenth century, England in fact lagged seriously behind continental Europe in the development of the mathematical sciences both on an institutional level, principally universities, and in terms of individual mathematical practitioners outside of the universities. Leading mathematical practitioners, working in England in the early sixteenth century, such as Thomas Gemini (1510–1562) and <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/06/09/the-deviser-of-the-kings-horologes/">Nicolas Kratzer (1486/7–1550)</a> were in fact immigrants, from the Netherlands and Germany respectively.</p>



<p>In the second half of the century the demand for mathematical practitioners in the fields of astrology, astronomy, navigation, cartography, surveying, and matters military was continually growing and England began to produce some home grown talent and take the mathematical disciplines more seriously, although the two universities, Oxford and Cambridge still remained aloof relying on enthusiastic informal teachers, such as <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2022/07/06/mathematician-astrologer-conjurer/">Thomas Allen (1542–1632) </a>rather than instituting proper chairs for the study and teaching of mathematics.</p>



<p>Outside of the universities ardent fans of the mathematical disciplines began to establish the so-called English school of mathematics, writing books in English, giving tuition, creating instruments, and carrying out mathematical tasks. Leading this group were the Welsh man, Robert Recorde (c. 1512–1558), who I shall return to in a later post, John Dee (1527–c. 1608), who I have dealt with in several post in the past,<a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2013/07/13/john-dee-the-mathematicall-praeface-and-the-english-school-of-mathematics/"> one of which outlines the English School</a>, other important early members being, Dee’s friend Leonard Digges, and his son Thomas Digges (c. 1446–1595), who both deserve posts of their own, and Thomas Hood (1556–1620) the first officially appointed lecturer for mathematics in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall return to give all these worthy gentlemen, and others, the attention they deserve but today I shall outline the life and mathematical career of John Blagrave (d. 1611) a member of the landed gentry, who gained a strong reputation as a mathematical practitioner and in particular as a designer of mathematical instruments, the antiquary Anthony à Wood (1632–1695), author of&nbsp;<em>Athenae Oxonienses. An Exact History of All the Writers and Bishops, who Have Had Their Education in the &#8230; University of Oxford from the Year 1500 to the End of the Year 1690</em>, described him as “the flower of mathematicians of his age.”</p>



<p>John Blagrave was the second son of another John Blagrave of Bullmarsh, a district of Reading, and his wife Anne, the daughter of Sir Anthony Hungerford of Down-Ampney, an English soldier, sheriff, and courtier during the reign of&nbsp;Henry VIII, John junior was&nbsp;born into wealth in the town of Reading in Berkshire probably sometime in the 1560s. He was educated at Reading School, an old established grammar school, before going up to St John’s College Oxford, where he apparently acquired his love of mathematics. This raises the question as to whether he was another student, who benefitted from the tutoring skills of Thomas Allen (1542–1632). He left the university without graduating, not unusually for the sons of aristocrats and the gentry. He settled down in Southcot Lodge in Reading, an estate that he had inherited from his father and devoted himself to his mathematical studies and the design of mathematical instruments. He also worked as a surveyor and was amongst the first to draw estate maps to scale.</p>

<p>There are five known surviving works by Blagrave and one map, as opposed to a survey, of which the earliest his,&nbsp;<em>The mathematical ievvel,</em>&nbsp;from1585, which lends its name to the title of this post, is the most famous. The full title of this work is really quite extraordinary:</p>

<p>Blagrave’s <em>Mathematical Jewel </em>is in fact a universal astrolabe, and by no means the first but probably the most extensively described. The astrolabe is indeed a multifunctional instrument, al-Sufi (903–983) describes over a thousand different uses for it, and Chaucer (c. 1340s–1400)&nbsp;in what is considered to be the first English language description of the astrolabe and its function, a pamphlet written for a child, describes at least forty different functions. However, the normal astrolabe has one drawback, the flat plates, called tympans of climata, that sit in the mater and are engraved with the stereographic projection of a portion of the celestial sphere are limited in their use to a fairly narrow band of latitude, meaning that if one wishes to use it at a different latitude you need a different climata. Most astrolabes have a set of plates each engraved on both side for a different band of latitude. This problem led to the invention of the universal astrolabe.</p>

<p>The earliest known universal astrolabes are attributed to&nbsp;Abū Isḥāq Ibrāhīm ibn Yaḥyā al-Naqqāsh al-Zarqālī&nbsp;al-Tujibi (1029-1100), known simply as&nbsp;al-Zarqālī and in Latin as Arzachel, an Arabic astronomer, astrologer, and instrument maker from Al-Andalus, and another contemporary Arabic astronomer, instrument maker from Al-Andalus,&nbsp;Alī&nbsp;ibn&nbsp;Khalaf:&nbsp;Abū&nbsp;al‐Ḥasan&nbsp;ibn&nbsp;Aḥmar&nbsp;al‐Ṣaydalānī or simply Alī&nbsp;ibn&nbsp;Khalaf, about whom very little is known. In the<em> Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers</em> (Springer Reference, 2007, pp. 34-35) Roser Puig has this to say about the two Andalusian instrument makers:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>ʿAlī ibn Khalaf is the author of a treatise on the use of the&nbsp;<em>lámina universal</em>&nbsp;(universal plate) preserved only in a Spanish translation included in the&nbsp;<em>Libros del Saber de Astronomía</em>&nbsp;(III, 11–132), compiled by the Spanish King Alfonso X. To our knowledge, the Arabic original is lost.&nbsp;ʿAlī ibn Khalaf is also credited with the construction of a universal instrument called&nbsp;<em>al‐asṭurlāb al‐maʾmūnī</em>&nbsp;in the year 1071, dedicated to al‐Maʾmūn, ruler of Toledo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The universal plate and the&nbsp;<em>ṣafīḥa</em>&nbsp;(the plate) of Zarqalī (devised in 1048) are the first “universal instruments” (<em>i.e.</em>, for all latitudes) developed in Andalus. Both are based on the stereographic meridian projection of each hemisphere, superimposing the projection of a half of the celestial sphere from the vernal point (and turning it) on to the projection of the other half from the autumnal point. However, their specific characteristics make them different instruments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Al-Zarqālī’s universal astrolabe was known as the Azafea in Arabic and as the Saphaea in Europe.</p>

<p>Much closer to Blagrave’s time, Gemma Frisius (1508–1555) wrote about a universal astrolabe, published as the&nbsp;<em>Medici ac Mathematici de astrolabio catholico liber quo latissime patientis instrumenti multiplex usus explicatur</em>, in 1556. Better known than Frisius’ universal instrument was that of his one-time Spanish, student Juan de Rojas y Samiento (fl. 1540-1550) published in his&nbsp;<em>Commentariorum in Astrolabium libri sex</em>&nbsp;in 1551.</p>

<p>Although he never really left his home town of Reading and his work was in English, Blagrave, like the other members of the English School of Mathematics, was well aware of the developments in continental Europe and he quotes the work of leading European mathematical practitioners in his&nbsp;<em>Mathematical Jewel</em>, such as the <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/the-influence-of-a-renaissance-mathematics-teacher/">Tübingen professor of mathematics, Johannes Stöffler</a> (1452–1531), who wrote a highly influential volume on the construction of astrolabes, his&nbsp;<em>Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii</em>&nbsp;originally published in 1513, which went through 16 editions up to 1620</p>

<p>or the works of Gemma Frisius, who was possibly the most influential mathematical practitioner of the sixteenth century. Blagrave’s <em>Mathematical Jewel</em> was based on Gemma Frisius&nbsp;<em>astrolabio catholico</em>.</p>



<p>Blagrave’s <em>Mathematical Jewel</em> was obviously popular because <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/how-i-got-to-know-joseph-moxon-on-asking-the-right-questions/">Joseph Moxon (1627–1691), England first specialist mathematical publisher</a>, cartographer, instrument, and globe maker republished it under the title:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The catholique planisphaer which Mr. Blagrave calleth the mathematical jewel briefly and plainly discribed in five books : the first shewing the making of the instrument, the rest shewing the manifold vse of it, 1. for representing several projections of the sphere, 2. for resolving all problemes of the sphere, astronomical, astrological, and geographical, 4. for making all sorts of dials both without doors and within upon any walls, cielings, or floores, be they never so irregular, where-so-ever the direct or reflected beams of the sun may come : all which are to be done by this instrument with wonderous ease and delight : a treatise very usefull for marriners and for all ingenious men who love the arts mathematical / by John Palmer &#8230; ; hereunto is added a brief description of the cros-staf and a catalogue of eclipses observed by the same I.P.</p>

<p>John Palmer (1612-1679), who was apparently rector of Ecton and archdeacon of Northampton, is variously described as the author or the editor of the volume, which was first published in 1658 and went through sixteen editions up to 1973.</p>



<p>Following&nbsp;<em>The Mathematical Jewel</em>, Blagrave published four further books on scientific instruments that we know of:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Baculum Familliare, Catholicon sive Generale. A Booke of the making and use of a Staffe, newly invented by the Author, called the Familiar Staffe&nbsp;</em>(London, 1590)</p>



<p><em>Astrolabium uranicum generale, a necessary and pleasaunt solace and recreation for navigators &#8230; compyled by John Blagrave&nbsp;</em>(London, 1596)</p>



<p><em>An apollogie confirmation explanation and addition to the Vranicall astrolabe&nbsp;</em>(London, 1597)</p>



<p>None of these survive in large numbers.</p>



<p> Blagrave also manufactured sundials and his fourth instrument book is about this:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The art of dyalling in two parts</em>&nbsp;(London, 1609)</p>

<p>Here there are considerably more surviving copies and even a modern reprint by&nbsp;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum Ltd., Da Capo Press,&nbsp;Amsterdam, New York,&nbsp;1968.</p>



<p>People who don’t think about it tend to regard books on dialling, that is the mathematics of the construction and installation of sundials, as somehow odd. However, in this day and age, when almost everybody walks around with a mobile phone in their pocket with a highly accurate digital clock, we tend to forget that, for most of human history, time was not so instantly accessible. In the Early Modern period, mechanical clocks were few and far between and mostly unreliable. For time, people relied on sundials, which were common and widespread. From the invention of printing with movable type around 1450 up to about 1700, books on dialling constituted the largest genre of mathematical books printed and published. Designing and constructing sundials was a central part of the profession of mathematical practitioners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as the books there is one extant map:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<p>This is described as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Two engraved maps, the first terrestrial, the second celestial (&#8220;Astrolabium uranicum generale …&#8221;). Evidently intended to illustrate Blagrave&#8217;s book &#8220;Astrolabium uranicum generale&#8221; but are not found in any copy of the latter.<br>The original is in the Bodleian Library.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When he died in 1611, Blagrave was buried in the St Laurence Church in Reading with a suitably mathematical monument. </p>

<p>Blagrave was a minor, but not insignificant, participant in the mathematical community in England in the late sixteenth century. His work displays the typical Renaissance active interest in the practical mathematical disciplines, astronomy, navigation, surveying, and dialling. He seems to have enjoyed a good reputation and his <em>Mathematical Jewel</em> appears to have found a wide readership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One area that is not usually counted among the sciences is cryptography, lying as it does, in this day and age, between, logic, mathematics, and informatics. In earlier times it is perhaps best viewed as a part of logic. Perhaps surprisingly, cryptography underwent a major development during the Renaissance provoked by an earlier development in the hands of Islamicate scholars.</p>



<p>Cryptography means literally hidden writing, coming from the Greek&nbsp;<em>kryptos</em>&nbsp;meaning hidden and&nbsp;<em>graphia</em>meaning write, express in written characters, so codes. We have very little evidence of the use of codes by the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, or Greeks, although it can be assumed that they did so. It is known that the ancient Greeks sent secret messages by shaving the head of a slave, writing, or tattooing the message on their skull, and then waiting until the hair grew back. Not really encryption and anything but high-speed communication.</p>



<p>The most well-known system of encryption from antiquity is the Caesar cipher, used by Julius Caesar in his correspondence. This is a very simple substitution code in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by the letter so many places before or after it in the alphabet. Up till the Middle Ages, in Europe all codes were some form of simple substitution code.</p>

<p>The first significant work on cryptography was written the Arabic philologist&nbsp;Abu ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān al-Khalīl ibn Aḥmad ibn ‘Amr ibn Tammām al-Farāhīdī al-Azdī al-Yaḥmadī&nbsp;(718–786 CE) known as&nbsp;Al-Farāhīdī&nbsp;or&nbsp;Al-Khalīl. His book&nbsp;<em>Kitab al-Muamma&nbsp;</em>(<em>Book of Cryptographic</em>&nbsp;<em>Messages</em>), which has been lost, presents the use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Al-Khalīl’s book influenced the work on cryptography by the Arabic polymath Abū Yūsuf Yaʻqūb ibn ʼIsḥāq aṣ-Ṣabbāḥ al-Kindī&nbsp;(c. 801–873), whose theory of radiations played a significant role in the history of optics. In his book&nbsp;<em>Risāla fī Istikhrāj al-Kutub al-Mu&#8217;ammāh</em>&nbsp;(<em>On Extracting Obscured Correspondence</em>), al-Kindī introduced the concept of frequency analysis, which made all simple substitute codes accessible to solution. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>One way to solve an encrypted message, if we know its language, is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most frequently occurring letter the &#8220;first&#8221;, the next most occurring letter the &#8220;second&#8221;, the following most occurring letter the &#8220;third&#8221;, and so on, until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample. Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols. We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the &#8220;first&#8221; letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the &#8220;second&#8221; letter, and the following most common symbol is changed to the form of the &#8220;third&#8221; letter, and so on, until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve.</p>

<p>Ai-Kindī’s explication of frequency analysis meant that a new more complex approach to encryption was necessary, and this was first delivered by the Renaissance polymath Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), whom we have already met in this series in the episodes <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/04/07/renaissance-science-vii/">on linear perspectiv</a>e and <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/07/01/renaissance-science-xiii/">architecture</a>. Alberti is one of those people, who deserves to be much better known than he is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a polyalphabetic cipher not one but several substitution alphabets are used for different sections of the text, changing at random intervals, with a signal in the text to indicate for the reader deciphering the code of the alphabetical change. A polyalphabetic cipher is, in theory, not susceptible to frequency analysis; this, of course, is only true if one doesn’t know the method. In order to implement his method Alberti invented his cipher disc, which he explained in a letter was inspired by the recent invention of the movable type printing press.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How the whole thing is supposed to function is described by Alberti in his&nbsp;<em>De</em>&nbsp;<em>componendis cifris</em>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Chapter XIV.</em>&nbsp;<em>I will first describe the movable index. Suppose that we agreed to use the letter k as an index letter in the movable disk.</em>&nbsp;<em>At the moment of writing I will position the two disks of the formula as I wish, for example juxtaposing the index letter to capital B, with all other small letters corresponding to the capital letters above them. When writing to you, I will first write a capital B that corresponds to the index k in the formula. This means that if you want to read my message you must use the identical formula you have with you, turning the movable disk until the letter B corresponds to the index k. Thus all small letters in the ciphertext will receive the meaning and sound of those above them in the stationary disk. When I have written three or four words I will change the position of the index in our formula, turning the disk until, say, the index k is under capital R.</em>&nbsp;<em>Then I will write a capital R in my message and from this point onward the small k will no longer mean B but R, and the letters that follow in the text, will receive new meanings from the capital letters above them in the stationary disk. When you read the message you have received, you will be advised by the capital letter, which you know is only used as a signal, that from this moment the position of the movable disk and of the index has been changed.</em>&nbsp;<em>Hence, you will also place the index under that capital letter, and in this way you will be able to read and understand the text very easily. The four letters in the movable disk facing the four numbered cells of the outer ring will not have, so to speak, any meaning by themselves and may be inserted as nulls within the text.</em>&nbsp;<em>However, if used in groups or repeated, they will be of great advantage, as I will explain later on.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Chapter XV.</em>&nbsp;<em>We can also choose the index letter among the capital letters and agree between us which of them will be the index.</em>&nbsp;<em>Let us suppose we chose the letter B as an index. The first letter to appear in the message will be a small one at will, say q.</em>&nbsp;<em>Hence, turning the movable disk in the formula you will place this letter under the capital B that serves as an index.</em>&nbsp;<em>It follows that q will take the sound and meaning of B.</em>&nbsp;<em>For the other letters we will continue writing in the manner described earlier for the movable index. When it is necessary to change the set up of the disks in the formula, then I will insert one, and no more, of the numeral letters into the message, that is to say one of the letters of the small disk facing the numbers which corresponds to, let’s say, 3 or 4, etc. Turning the movable disk I will juxtapose this letter to the agreed upon index B and, successively, as required by the logic of writing, I will continue giving the value of the capitals to the small letters.</em>&nbsp;<em>To further confuse the scrutinizers you can also agree with your correspondent that the capital letters intermingled in the message have the function of nulls and must be disregarded, or you may resort to similar conventions, which are not worth recalling.</em>&nbsp;<em>Thus changing the position of the index by rotating the movable disk, one will be able to express the phonetic and semantic value of each capital letter by means of twenty-four different alphabetic characters, whereas each small letter can correspond to any capital letter or to any of the four numbers in the alphabet of the stationary disk.</em>&nbsp;<em>Now I come to the convenient use of the numbers, which is admirable.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I leave it to the reader to decipher Alberti’s instructions.</p>



<p>Alberti was not the only Renaissance scholar to suggest the adoption of a polyalphabetic cipher. The German, Benedictine monk, Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516), born Johann Heidenberg, was Abbot of the Abbey of Sponheim and from 1506 of the St, James’ Abbey in Würzburg. </p>

<p>Trithemius was a polymath active as a lexicographer, chronicler, cryptographer, but above all he is known as an occultist. As I have noted in an earlier episode in this series <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/12/03/renaissance-science-xxiv/">the occult sciences played a significant part in Renaissance thought</a>. Trithemius is considered to have had a major influence on both Paracelsus (c. 1493–1541) and&nbsp;Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486–1535).</p>



<p>Trithemius’ most famous work was his&nbsp;<em>Steganographia</em>&nbsp;(written c. 1499 but first published in 1606), which was initially thought to be about magic and was placed on the&nbsp;<em>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</em>&nbsp;(<em>List of Prohibited Books</em>) by the Catholic Church in 1609. In fact, the book was written in code and already in 1606, the first two volumes were shown to be about steganography (a word that Trithemius coined) and cryptography. Steganography is:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The practice of hiding messages, so that the presence of the message itself is hidden, often by writing them in places where they may not be found until someone finds the secret message in whatever is being used to hide it. (def. Wiktionary).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third volume was, thought to be really about magic but has comparatively recently also shown to be about cryptography.</p>

<p>Although, he created a&nbsp;polyalphabetic cipher, the one that bears his name was actually first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso (1505–?) an Italian cryptographer in his&nbsp;<em>La Cifra del Sig. Giovan Battista Belaso</em> published in 1553. Bellaso went on to publish a second book,&nbsp;<em>Novi et singolari modi di cifrare</em>, in 1555 and a third one&nbsp;<em>Il vero modo di scrivere in cifra,</em> in 1565. Vigenère published his&nbsp;polyalphabetic cipher, first in 1586, in his<em>&nbsp;Traicté des Chiffres ou Secrètes Manières d&#8217;Escrire</em>. 1586. Both men’s ciphers were based on a so-called auto key but differed in detail.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>An&nbsp;autokey cipher&nbsp;(also known as the&nbsp;autoclave cipher) is a&nbsp;cipher&nbsp;that incorporates the message (the&nbsp;plaintext) into the&nbsp;key. The key is generated from the message in some automated fashion, sometimes by selecting certain letters from the text or, more commonly, by adding a short&nbsp;primer key&nbsp;to the front of the message. (Def. Wikipedia).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Vigenère cipher was thought to be unbreakable and in fact Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll), a very competent logician, said that it was unbreakable in 1868, <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/christmas-trilogy-2013-part-ii-on-her-majestys-secret-service/">unaware that Charles Babbage had already broken it earlier but had not published his results. </a>The first to publish a general system to solve polyalphabetic ciphers, including the Vigenère cipher, was the German soldier, cryptographer, and archaeologist, Friedrich Wilhelm Kasiski (1805–1881) in his&nbsp;Die Geheimschriften und die Dechiffrir-Kunst&nbsp;(Secret Writing and the Art of Deciphering) in 1863, a publication that, at the time, went largely unnoticed. It was first in the nineteenth century that the art of cryptography evolved past the innovations of the Renaissance cryptographers, Alberti, Trithemius, Vigenère, and Bellaso.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s historian Greg Jenner star of radio and TV, he’s part of the crew that magic&nbsp;<em>Horrible Histories</em>&nbsp;onto your TV screens, and mega podcast star with his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07mdbhg/episodes/downloads"><em>You’re Dead to Me</em>.</a> The book follows a child through its day, from being woken up by the alarm clock in the early morning to finally going to bed at night. At each station throughout the day the history of the everyday objects encountered is presented and explained is entertaining witty texts illustrated by wonderful pictures. Alarm clock, Toothpaste, letterbox, pencil case, chocolate, bicycle, cutlery, pyjamas, and, and, and, and, and … <strong>in total 137 objects</strong> that we encounter almost daily. This book is a winner. Greg is a serious historian, despite his love of bad jokes, and a little bird has told me that he has had everything fact checked by experts, so the child, who reads this delightful tome, is getting some solid history served up to them, as well as being entertained.</p>



<p>The book is available from 3 November, so get your orders in now and delight that child in your life on Christmas Day, or any other day for that matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One myth in the history of science that refuses to go away is that the Catholic Church was fundamental opposed to the modern science that emerged during the seventeenth century. They even according to one prevalent theory declared war on it. This myth is of course fuelled by the equally persistent false accounts of the conflicts between the Church and both Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei. English scholars, not necessarily historian of science, armed with their knowledge of the reputation of the Jesuits in Early Modern Protestant England, where they were denounced as spawn of the Devil, also polemicise against them, as particularly anti-progress including science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long term readers of this blog will know that over the years I have posted numerous essays that try to correct this false perception both for the Catholic Church in general and for the Jesuits in particular. In fact, my very first substantive history of science post was <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2009/06/11/a-loser-who-was-really-a-winner/">an attempt to restore the reputation of Christoph Clavius</a>, who introduced the mathematical sciences into the Jesuit’s educational programme, making them amongst the best educated mathematician of the period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long ago I read&nbsp;<em>The New Science and Jesuit Science: Seventeenth Century Perspectives</em>, edited by Mordechai Feingold, (Springer, 2003), an excellent book, in which the first essay is by&nbsp;Michael John Gorman, and now I have been reading Gorman’s&nbsp;<em>The Scientific Counter-Revolution</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Jesuits and the Invention of Modern Science<a href="//BD80D207-79FF-447D-A848-6C90A69EE528#_ftn1"><sup><strong>[1]</strong></sup></a></em>, of which the paperback was published this year, and which contains the essay mentioned above. This book is a must read for anybody interested in the Jesuit contribution to seventeenth century science.</p>

<p>I have included a scan of the back cover of the book, because the two ringing endorsements from Paula Findlen and Simon Schaffer, together with the publisher’s blurb should be enough to convince anybody interested in the topic that this is a must read, without further comment from me. However, I will, of course, make some comments.</p>



<p>This book is based on Gorman’s doctoral dissertation from 1999. It is not a continuous flowing narrative but, rather, a set of seven essays connected by a common theme, version of six of which have already been published in other contexts. Despite the previous publications, the book is more than worth reading, because the essays, as a whole, create a rounded picture of the Jesuits evolving role in mathematics and natural philosophy in the seventeenth century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The opening chapter,&nbsp;<em>Establishing Mathematical Authority</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Politics of Christoph Clavius</em>, the only one not previously published, deals with Clavius’ introduction of mathematics into the Jesuits’ educational curriculum with a strong emphasis on his motivation for doing so and the political arguments he used to justify this move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second chapter,&nbsp;<em>Mathematics and Modesty</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Problemata of Christoph Grienberger</em>, illustrates the Jesuits personal requirement of humility and rejection of vanity in their work. This is illustrated with a description of the life and work of Christoph Grienberger, Clavius’ successor as professor for mathematics at the Collegio Romano, who almost completely disappeared behind his work. Perhaps the most extreme example of the abrogation of personality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Jesuits provide a difficult subject for the historian of the scientific revolution because they are not the enemies of science that some try to paint them nor are they, despite their own substantial contributions, unrestricted supporters of the new developments in science. There is a tension between the Clavian application of modern mathematics and experimentation to the sciences and the fundamental Jesuit obligation to adhere to the Aristotelian science of Thomist philosophy. Gorman’s book expertly brings this paradox out into the open displaying and analysing it from all sides.</p>



<p>The third chapter of the book, <em>Discipline, Authority and Jesuit Censorship</em>: <em>From the Galileo Trial to the Ordinatio Pro Studiis Superioribus</em>, is an in-depth analysis of this paradox. Gorman actually argues, convincingly, that the Jesuits’ requirement that all scientific texts be submitted to the Oder&#8217;s authorities for censorship is an early form of peer review.</p>



<p>The fourth chapter,&nbsp;<em>The Jesuits and the Vacuum Debate</em>, was the one that I found most fascinating and from which I learnt the most. The invention of the Torricellian Tube, or barometer, unleashed a heated debate in the seventeenth century as to whether the empty space at the top of the tube was or was not a vacuum. Aristotle had argued that a vacuum could not exist, so the Jesuits were forced to take the side of denial, as we now know the wrong side. As is often the case in the history of science, their opposition actually stimulated the advancement of the science, as the supporters of the vacuum theory were required to counter their arguments. Interestingly the Jesuit opposition was not just philosophical. One of the principal supporters of the vacuum theory was another, non-Jesuit, Catholic scholar, and the Jesuits feared that if he won the debate that this would lead to a diminishing of their dominance in Catholic education. The whole chapter is an excellent example of the complexity of scientific evolution and its history.</p>



<p>There now follow two chapters on Athanasius Kircher, perhaps the most well-known scientific, Jesuit scholar of the century. The first,&nbsp;<em>The Angel and the Compass</em>:&nbsp;<em>Athanasius Kircher’s Geographical Project</em>, deals with Kircher’s failed project to create a new, reformed&nbsp;&nbsp;geography of the entire world by creating a world spanning network of researchers providing input to a central authority, himself. Although Kircher’s project, inspired by similar smaller collective research projects of Peiresc and Mersenne, in the end failed, Gorman sees the attempt as an important step in the evolving practice of scientific research. He also sees the Jesuits process of the central accumulation of scientific data in the Collegio Romano via world-wide correspondence, as an important model for others working in science.</p>



<p>The second chapter on Kircher, Between the&nbsp;<em>Domonic and the Miraculous</em>:&nbsp;<em>Athanasius Kircher and the Baroque Culture of Machines</em>, takes a detailed look at&nbsp;<em>Musaeum Kircherianum</em>&nbsp;and its role as a public magnet to promote the Jesuit Order under the European civil and scientific aristocracies. He details the explanations of natural magic given by Kircher and above all his disciple Kasper Schott to explain the function of Kircher’s automatons, machines that initially appear to contradict the laws of nature but whose secret can be explained by those same laws.</p>

<p>Gorman’s final chapter,&nbsp;<em>From ‘The Eyes Of All’ to ‘</em><em>Usefull&nbsp;Quarries in Philosophy and Good Literature’: The Changing Reputation of the Jesuit Mathematicus</em>, re-examines the trajectory of his book from Clavius to Kircher and how the emphasis and public presentation of the mathematicians of the Collegio Romano had changed over the century, not necessarily for the better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gorman is an excellent writer and his prose is clear and a pleasure to red. The book is illustrated with a series of greyscale illustration. There are informative endnotes, no footnotes, at the end of each essay but unfortunately no general bibliography. There is a good index.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the introduction, we can read:</p>

<p>Only 29.2% of the surface is land but, on that land, there are many enclosed seas, lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams so there is even more water. The human body is about 60% water, and humans are sometimes referred to as a water-based life form. The statistics are variable, but a healthy human can exist between one and two months without food but only two to four days without water. Brought to a simple formular, water is life.</p>



<p>When humans first began to settle, they did so on or near sources of water–lake shores, streams, rivers, natural springs. Where there was no obvious water supply people began to dig wells, there are wells dating back to 6500 BCE. As settlements grew the problem of water supply and sewage disposal became important and the profession of water manager or hydraulic engineer came into existence. Channelling of fresh water and sewage disposal, recycling of wastewater etc. Initial all of this was powered by gravity but over time other systems of moving water, such as the bucket water wheel or noria were developed for lifting water from one channel into another, appearing in Egypt around the fourth century BCE.</p>

<p>Probably the most spectacular surviving evidence of the water management in antiquity are the massive aqueducts built by Roman engineers to bring an adequate supply of drinking water to the Roman settlements. Alone the city of Rome had eleven aqueducts built between 312 BCE and 226 CE, the shortest of which the Aqua Appia from 312 BCE was 16.5 km long with a capacity of 73,000 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;per day and the longest the Aqua Anio Novus from 52 CE was 87 km long with a capacity of 189,000 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;per day. The Aqua Alexandrina from 226 CE was only 22 km long but had a capacity of 120,00 to 320,000 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;per day.</p>

<p>Much earlier the Greek engineer Hero of Alexandria (c. 10–c. 70 CE), as well as numerous devices driven by wind and steam, invented a&nbsp;stand-alone fountain that operates under self-contained hydro-static energy, known as Heron’s Fountain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of the above is out of the realm of engineers. Another engineer Archimedes (c. 287–c. 212 BCE), is the subject of possibly the most well-known story in the history of science, one needs only utter the Greek word&nbsp;εὕρηκα (Eureka) to invoke visions of crowns of gold, bathtubs, and naked bearded man running through the streets shouting the word. In fact, you won’t find this story anywhere in Archimedes not insubstantial writings. The source of the story is in&nbsp;<em>De architectura</em>&nbsp;by Vitruvius (C. 80-70–after c. 15 BCE), so two hundred years after Archimedes lived. You can read the original in translation below:</p>

<p>However, Archimedes did write a book&nbsp;<em>On Floating Bodies</em>, which now only exists partially in Greek but in full in a medieval Latin translation. This book is the earliest known work of the branch of physics known as hydrostatics. It contains clear statement of two fundamental principles of hydrostatics, Firstly Archimedes’ principle:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Any body wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences an upward force (buoyancy) equal to the weight of the fluid displaced</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Secondly the principle of floatation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Any floating object displaces its own weight of fluid.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As well these two fundamental principles, he also discovered that a submerged object displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume. This is the discovery that led to the legendary of mythical Eureka incident. A crown of pure gold would have a different displacement volume to one of a gold and silver amalgam. The bath story was, as we will see later, highly implausible because it would be very, very difficult to measure the difference in the displaced volumes of water of the two crowns.</p>



<p>Whilst water management continued to develop through out the Middle Ages, with the invention of every better water mills etc., In the Renaissance the profession hydraulic engineer saw developments in two areas. Firstly, the increase in wealth and the development of residences saw the emergence of the Renaissance Garden. Large ornamental gardens the usually featured extensive and often spectacular water features. </p>

<p>The Renaissance mathematici employed by potentates and aristocrats were often expected to serve as hydraulic engineers alongside their other functions as instrument makers, astrologers etc. Secondly the major increase in mining for precious and semi-precious metals meant ever deeper mines, which brought with it the problem of pumping water out of the mines.</p>



<p>Archimedes’&nbsp;<em>On Floating Bodies</em>&nbsp;was translated into Latin by William of Moerbeke (c. 1215–1286) in the thirteenth century and no complete Greek manuscript is known to exist. This translation was edited by Nicolò Tartaglia Fontana (c. 1506–1557) and published in print along with other works by Archimedes by Venturino Ruffinelli in Venice in 1543, as<em> Opera Archimedis Syracvsani philosophi et mathematici ingeniosissimi</em></p>

<p>The Nürnberger theologian and humanist Thomas Venatorius (1488–1551) edited the first printed edition of the Greek manuscripts of Archimedes, in a bilingual Greek/Latin edition, which was published in Basel by Johann Herwagen in 1544. The Greek manuscript had been brought to Nürnberg by the humanist scholar, Willibald Pirckheimer (1470–1530) from Rome and the Latin translation by Jacopo da Cremona (fl. 1450) was from the manuscript collection of Regiomontanus (1436-1476). </p>

<p>Tartaglia, who also produced an Italian edition of&nbsp;<em>On floating Bodies</em>, was the first Renaissance scholar to address Archimedes work on hydrostatics. It did not play a major role in his own work, but he was the first to draw attention to the relationship between the laws of fall and Archimedes’ thoughts on flotation. Tartaglia’s work was read by his one-time student, Giambattista Benedetti ((1530–1590), Galileo (1564–1642), and Simon Stevin (1548–1620), amongst other, and was almost certainly the introduction to Archimedes’ text for all three of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benedetti replaced Aristotle’s concepts of fall in a fluid directly with Archimedes’ ideas in his work on the laws of fall, equating resistance in the fluid with Archimedes’ upward force or buoyancy. This led him to his anticipations of Galileo’s work on the laws of fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving onto Simon Stevin, who wrote a major work on hydrostatics, his <em>De Beghinselen des Waterwichts</em> (<em>Principles on the weight of water</em>) in 1586 and a never completed practical <em>Preamble to the Practice of Hydrostatics</em>. </p>

<p>One of Benedetti’s major works,&nbsp;<em>Demonstratio propotionummotuum localiumcontra Aristotilem et omnes philosphos</em>&nbsp;(1554) had been plagiarised by the French mathematician Jean Taisnier (1598–1562)&nbsp;<em>Opusculum perpetua memoria dignissimum, de natura magnetis et ejus effectibus, Item de motu continuo</em>&nbsp;(1562) and it was this that Stevin read rather than Benedetti’s original. Taisnier’s plagiarism was also translated into English by Richard Eden (c. 1520–1576) an alchemist and promotor of overseas exploration. Stevin a practical engineer ignored or rejected the equivalence between the laws of fall and the principle of buoyancy, concentrating instead on the relationship between flotation and the design of ship’s hulls. His major contribution was the so-called hydrostatic paradox often falsely attributed to Pascal. This states that the downward pressure exerted by a fluid in a vessel is only dependent on its depth and not on the width or length of the vessel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the three, Galileo is most well-known for his adherence to Archimedes. He clearly stated that in his natural philosophy he had replaced Aristotle with Archimedes as his ancient Greek authority, and this can be seen in his work. His very first work was an essay&nbsp;<em>La Bilancetta&nbsp;</em>(<em>The Little Balance</em>)&nbsp;written in 1586, but first published posthumously in 1644, which he presented to both Guidobaldo del Monte (1545–1607) and Christoph Clavius (1538–1612), both leading mathematical authorities, in the hope of winning their patronage. He was successful in both cases. </p>

<p>Realising, that the famous bathtub story couldn’t actually have worked, Galileo tried to recreate how Archimedes might actually have done it. He devised a very accurate hydrostatic balance that would have made the discovery feasible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later in life, when firmly established as court philosopher in Florence, Galileo was called upon by Cosimo II Medici to debate the principles of flotation with the Aristotelian physicist Lodovico delle Columbe (c. 1565–after 1623), as after dinner entertainment. As I have written before one of Galileo’s principal functions at the court in Florence was to provide such entertainment as a sort of intellectual court jester. Galileo was judged to have carried the day and his contribution to the debate was published in Italian, as&nbsp;<em>Discorso intorno alle cose che stanno in su l&#8217;acqua, o che in quella si muovono</em>, (<em>Discourse on Bodies that Stay</em>&nbsp;<em>Atop Water, or Move in It</em>) in 1612. </p>

<p>As was his wont, Galileo mocked his Aristotelian opponent is his brief essay, which brought him the enmity of the Northern Italian Aristotelians. Although Galileo’s approach to the topic was Archimedean, he couldn’t explain everything and not all that he said was correct. However, this little work enjoyed a widespread reception and was influential.</p>



<p>Our last Renaissance contribution to hydrostatics was made by Evangelista Torricelli (1608–1647), a student of Benedetto Castelli (1578–1643) himself a student of Galileo, and like Stevin’s work it came from the practical world rather than the world of science. </p>

<p>Torricelli was looking for a solution as to why a suction pump could only raise water to a hight of ten metres, as recounted in Galileo’s&nbsp;<em>Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze</em>&nbsp;(<em>Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences</em>) (1638), a major problem for the expanding deep mining industry, which needed to pump water out of its mines. Torricelli in his investigations invented the Torricellian tube, later called the barometer, with which he demonstrated that there was a limit to the height of a column of liquid that the weight of the atmosphere, or air pressure, could support. </p>

<p>He also incidentally demonstrated the existence of a vacuum, something Aristotle said could not exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Torricelli’s work marks the transition from Renaissance science to what is called modern science. Building on the work of Benedetti, Stevin, Galileo, and Torricelli, Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) laid some of the modern foundation of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, having a unit for pressure named after him and being sometimes falsely credited with discoveries that were actually made in the earlier phase by his predecessors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday I wrote<a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2022/10/03/i-expect-better-of-you-beinecke/"> a quick blogpost on the not insubstantial errors in the description of one of Galileo’s lunar washes posted on the Beinecke Library blog.</a> I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when within a day the description had been heavily edited, removing all the sections that I had criticised, even if no acknowledgement was made that changes had taken place or why.  In my elation over this turn of events I failed to properly read what now stood under Galileo’s image. One of my readers, Todd Timberlake author of <em>Finding Our Place in the Solar System: The Scientific Story of the Solar System</em>, was more observant than I and correctly stated that the modified version was now, if possible worse than the original. So, what had curator Richard Clemens done now? </p>

<p>Left us examine what can only be described as a disaster, the text now reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our mini-exhibits end with the vitrine holding several copies of Galileo’s first printed images of the moon made with the benefit of the telescope. &nbsp;<strong>He shows the shadow the earth casts on the moon and the moon’s rocky surface</strong>. [my emphasis] A photograph at the back of the vitrine was taken in 1968, before humans landed on the moon. It shows Earth as seen from the moon—the first time we saw our own planet from another astronomical body. This rough black and white image eerily resembles Galileo’s lunar landscape.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The only time the Earth’s shadow is visible on the Moon is during a lunar eclipse when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon thus blocking off the Sun’s light. Galileo did not make drawings of any telescopic observations of the Moon during a lunar eclipse. What we actually have is an image of the Moon at third quarter put together by Galileo from his observations. The light side on the left is the half of the Moon that is visible at third quarter, the dark side on right is the half not visible. The jagged line down the middle is the so-called lunar terminator:&nbsp;the division between the illuminated and dark hemispheres of the&nbsp;Moon.</p>

<p>Without being snarky, I think that Mr Clemens would do well to consult somebody who knows what they are talking about before writing his descriptions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ethan Siegel is an astrophysicist, but he is better known as a highly successful science populariser, who even has his own Wikipedia page.&nbsp;&nbsp;He first rose to fame as the author of the blog&nbsp;<a href="https://www.startswithabang.com"><em>Starts</em>&nbsp;<em>With a Bang</em>,</a> which he launched in 2008. He expanded his brand, with the publication of popular books on physics. He expanded still further, making podcasts and writing posts under his brand name on&nbsp;<em>Medium</em>,&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Big Think</em>. He is today one of the biggest names on the Internet in popularisation of physics. Here I’m going to look at his latest publication on&nbsp;<em>Big Think</em>.&nbsp;<a href="https://bigthink.com"><em>Big Think</em>&nbsp;</a>is a multiplatform, multimedia Internet organisation who in their own words state:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our mission is to make you smater, faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;At Big Think, we introduce you to the brightest minds and boldest ideas of our time, inviting viewers to explore new ways to work, live, and understand our ever-changing world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Big Think challenges common sense assumptions and gives people permission to think in new ways.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’m sorry, but to my ears that sounds like those windy ads on the Internet that say, “Take our three-week course of our seminars once a week and you will be earning $100,000 a month within a year!”</p>



<p>So, what is the post of Dr Siegel on Big Think that has attracted the attention of The Renaissance Mathematicus and why? Our intrepid astrophysicist and physics populariser has decided to try his hand at history of science and has written a post about Johannes Kepler,&nbsp;<em>Why Johannes Kepler is a scientist’s best role model</em>. After all our author is a scientist and a successful science populariser, who has even won prestigious awards for his work, what could possibly go wrong, when he tries a bit of history of science? Unfortunately, as with other scientists and science populariser, who think they can do history of science, without investing serious time and effort in the discipline, almost everything.</p>

<p>So why does Siegel think that the good Johannes should be every scientist’s role model? He tells us in his lede:</p>



<ul>
<li>The annals of history are filled with scientists who had incredible, revolutionary ideas, sought out and found the evidence to support them, and initiated a scientific revolution.&nbsp;</li>



<li>But much rarer is someone who has a brilliant idea, discovers that the evidence doesn&#8217;t quite fit, and instead of doggedly pursuing it, tosses it aside in favor of a newer, better, more successful idea.&nbsp;</li>



<li>That&#8217;s exactly what separates Johannes Kepler from all of the other great scientists throughout history, and why, if we have to choose a scientific role model, we should admire him so thoroughly.</li>
</ul>



<p>He then delivers four examples of famous scientists, who could not admit they were wrong:</p>



<ul>
<li>Albert Einstein could never accept quantum indeterminism as a fundamental property of nature.</li>



<li>Arthur Eddington could never accept quantum degeneracy as a source for holding white dwarfs up against gravitational collapse.</li>



<li>Newton could never accept the experiments that demonstrated the wave nature of light, including interference and diffraction.</li>



<li>And Fred Hoyle could never accept the Big Bang as the correct story of our cosmic origins, even nearly 40 years after the critical evidence, in the form of the Cosmic Microwave Background, was discovered.</li>
</ul>



<p>I already have a couple of comments here. Niels Bohr is on record as saying that Einstein through his intelligent, astute, and penetrating criticisms of quantum theory that demanded answers contributed more to the development of that theory than almost anybody else. Not least Bell’s theorem, one of the key developments in quantum theory, was based on his analysis of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox. Opposition to theories based on knowledge are important to the evolution of those theories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Newton did in fact reject a wave theory of light in favour of a particle theory. However, he was able with his theory to explain all the known optical phenomenon. Moreover, when Hooke rejected his theory of colour saying that it wouldn’t work in a wave theory, Newton developed a wave theory, that was more advanced than those of Hooke and Huygens, to show that his theory of colour did work in a wave theory. Lastly, as I love to point out, Einstein won the Nobel Prize for physics, not for relativity, but for demonstrating that light consists of particles, so Newton wasn’t so wrong after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More generally, there is a famous quote from Max Planck about the development of new theories in science:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A new scientific&nbsp;truth&nbsp;does not generally triumph by persuading its opponents and getting them to admit their errors, but rather by its opponents gradually dying out and giving way to a new generation that is raised on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then goes on to tell us why Kepler was a spectacular exception. First, we get a popular rundown of the observable phenomena of the cosmos and why that led to a geocentric model. On the whole OK but littered with small errors. For example, he tells us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Earth was big, and its diameter had been measured&nbsp;<strong>precisely</strong>&nbsp;[my emphasis] by Eratosthenes in the 3rd century B.C.E.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is, unfortunately, typical of Siegel’s hyperbolic style. Depending on which value for the stadium one takes, Eratosthenes’ estimate of the size of the earth was relatively close to the real value but by no means precise. Also, in antiquity no one knew how correct it was and most people actually accepted other values.</p>



<p>We then get a description of the deferent/epicycle model for the planets and Siegel tells us that Ptolemy made the best, most successful model of the Solar system that incorporated epicycles. Nothing to criticise here but there follows immediately a small misstep, he writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Going all the way back to ancient times, there was some evidence — from Archimedes and Aristarchus, among others — that a Sun-centered model for planetary motion was considered.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>First off you really shouldn’t use an expression like “ancient times.” We know that both Archimedes and Aristarchus lived and worked in the third century BCE, so we can say that. The expression “there was some evidence from Archimedes and Aristarchus, among others” is a load of waffle, which doesn’t actually tell the reader anything. According to a couple of secondary sources Aristarchus of Samos devised a heliocentric system. We don’t have anything about it from Aristarchus himself. Archimedes is one of the secondary sources but not in a work on astronomy or cosmology. Archimedes wrote a work on calculating and expressing large numbers,&nbsp;<em>The Sand Reckoner</em>, in which he calculated the number of grains of sand needed to fill the cosmos. He used Aristarchus’ heliocentric model, which he only mentions in passing, because the heliocentric cosmos is considered to be larger the than the geocentric one.</p>



<p>Siegel now moves onto Copernicus and once again delivers up historical rubbish:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Copernicus was frustrated to discover that his model gave less successful predictions when compared against Ptolemy’s. The only way Copernicus could devise to equal Ptolemy’s successes, in fact, relied on employing the same ad hoc fix: by adding epicycles, or small circles, atop his planetary orbits!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As stated, this is rubbish. From the very beginning Copernicus used deferent/epicycle models for the planetary orbits. He didn’t add epicycles as an ad hoc solution because&nbsp;<em>his model gave less successful predictions when compared against Ptolemy’s</em>. In fact, Copernicus didn’t produce any planetary tables before he died in the year that his&nbsp;<em>De revolutionibus</em>&nbsp;was published, so he couldn’t know about the comparative predictive powers of his and Ptolemy’s system. When Erasmus Reinhold (1511–1553) did produce his&nbsp;<em>Prutenic Tables</em>&nbsp;(1551), the first ones based on Copernicus’ model, it turned out that in some cases the predictions were better than in tables based on Ptolemy and in some cases worse. This was because Copernicus used the same, in the meantime corrupted through frequent copying, basic data for his models as Ptolemy. This problem was recognised by Tycho Brahe, which is why he set up his massive astronomical observation programme, on the island of Hven, in order to provide new basic data. It is to Tycho that Siegel now turns.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Tycho Brahe, for example, constructed the best naked eye astronomy setup in history, measuring the planets as precisely as human vision allows: to within one arc-minute (1/60th of a degree) during every night that planets were visible towards the end of the 1500s. His assistant, Johannes Kepler, attempted to make a glorious, beautiful model that fit the data precisely.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is Siegel’s introduction to Kepler’s&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>&nbsp;published in 1596, four years before he even met Tycho and began to work with him! Siegel now gives a brief description of the model presented in the&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>and follows it up with a pile of absolute garbage.</p>

<p> Maybe our astrophysicist author has slipped into a parallel universe because what he presents here is hyperbollocks, an assorted collection of made-up “facts” thrown together in a narrative that bears absolutely no relation to what really happened in history. As a Kepler fan when I read this and the following paragraphs eight days ago, I began banging my head against the wall and haven’t stopped since. No pain can blot out the stupidity presented here.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Kepler formulated this model in the 1590s, and Brahe boasted that only his observations could put such a model to the test. But no matter how Kepler did his calculations, not only did disagreements with observation remain, but Ptolemy’s geocentric model still made superior predictions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tycho made no such boast, that is simply made up and in fact he was not in any way interested in Kepler’s model. Kepler wanted to work with Tycho to get access to his data to fine tune his model, Tycho wanted to employ Kepler to do the mathematics necessary to turn his data into models for the planets orbits in his own geo-heliocentric model. When Kepler arrived in Prague, Tycho refused him access to the data he wanted out of fear of being plagiarised. Instead, he set Kepler to write a paper proving that Ursus had plagiarised him. The resulting essay is brilliant, was however first published in the nineteenth century, and has been described by Cambridge historian of science, Nicholas Jardine as <em>The Birth of History and Philosophy of Science</em> (CUP, 2<sup>nd</sup> rev. ed. 1988). Following this he was given the task of determining the orbit of Mars using Tycho’s data, to which I will return in a minute. </p>



<p>At this point in his life Kepler made no attempt to improve his geometrical model. The phrase,&nbsp;<em>Ptolemy’s geocentric model still made superior predictions</em>&nbsp;is quite simple mind boggling for anybody who knows what they are talking about. The geometric model that Kepler presents in his&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>&nbsp;is his answer to the question, why are there exactly six planets? Kepler argues that his completely rational God, who is a geometer, designed his cosmos rationally and geometrically and there are exactly six planets because there are only five regular Platonic solids to fill the spaces between them. Not our idea of rational but Kepler was mighty pleased with his “discovery.” This model makes no predictions of any kind!</p>



<p>Now we get to the crux of Siegel’s whole argument, Kepler admitting he was wrong:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the face of this, what do you think Kepler did?</p>



<ul>
<li>Did he tweak his model, attempting to save it?</li>



<li>Did he distrust the critical observations, demanding new, superior ones?</li>



<li>Did he make additional postulates that could explain what was truly occurring, even if it was unseen, in the context of his model?</li>
</ul>



<p>No. Kepler did none of these. Instead, he did something revolutionary: he put his own ideas and his own favored model aside, and looked at the data to see if there was a better explanation that could be derived from demanding that any model needed to agree with the full suite of observational data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kepler didn’t&nbsp;<em>tweak his model</em>, at this time, attempting to save it, he certainly didn’t mistrust Tycho’s data, and he didn’t at this time add any postulates. He did put his model aside but not to look&nbsp;<em>at the data to see if there was a better explanation that could be derived from demanding that any model needed to agree with the full suite of observational data</em>. He was too busy doing other thing, things that served other purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If only we could all be so brave, so brilliant, and at the same time, so humble before the Universe itself! Kepler calculated that ellipses, not circles, would better fit the data that Brahe had so painstakingly acquired. Although it defied his intuition, his common sense, and even his personal preferences for how he felt the Universe ought to have behaved — indeed, he thought that the&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>&nbsp;was a divine epiphany that had revealed God’s geometrical plan for the Universe to him — Kepler was successfully able to abandon his notion of “circles and spheres” and instead used what seemed to him to be an imperfect solution: ellipses.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here without explicitly naming it, Siegel is referencing Kepler’s work on the orbit of Mars that he published in his&nbsp;<em>Astronomia Nova</em>&nbsp;in 1609. It was during the many years of his “War with Mars”, his own description, that he finally discovered his first two laws of planetary motion: 1: Planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse 2: A line from the Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time. For a good description of the route to the&nbsp;<em>Astronomia Nova</em>, I recommend James R. Voelkel’s excellent&nbsp;<em>The Composition of</em>&nbsp;<em>Kepler’s Astronomia nova</em>&nbsp;(Princeton University Press, 2001).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Siegel apparently thinks that this refutes Kepler’s&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>, it doesn’t. The&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>&nbsp;doesn’t deal with the shape of orbits at all. His model has the Platonic solids filling the spaces between the spheres. In the Ptolemaic deferent/epicycle system the orbits are not simple circle because of the epicycle. Ptolemy in his&nbsp;<em>Planetary Hypothesis</em>&nbsp;embedded the deferent/epicycle in a sphere but the book that got lost and was only rediscovered in the 1960s in a single Arabic copy. However, Peuerbach (1423–1461) revived this model in his&nbsp;<em>Theoricae Novae Planetarum</em>&nbsp;(written in 1454, published by Regiomontanus in 1472), which is almost certainly based on a now lost copy of the&nbsp;<em>Planetary Hypothesis</em>, with illustrations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Copernicus’ heliocentric system, which also uses the deferent/epicycle models would suffer from the same problem and it is between these spheres that Kepler places his Platonic solids, irrespective of the orbit inside the sphere. The system would work equally well for elliptical orbits, so Kepler’s discovery of them had no effect on his&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Siegel gives a table of Tycho’s Mars observations with the following caption:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Tycho Brahe conducted some of the best observations of Mars prior to the invention of the telescope, and Kepler’s work largely leveraged that data. Here, Brahe’s observations of Mars’s orbit, particularly during retrograde episodes,&nbsp;<strong>provided an exquisite confirmation of Kepler’s elliptical orbit theory.</strong></em>&nbsp;[my emphasis]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kepler used Tycho’s Mars data to derive his first two laws, so they can’t be used by him as confirmation. In fact, at the beginning he didn’t actual confirm his theory, simple assuming it applied to all the planets. It wasn’t until his&nbsp;<em>Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae</em>&nbsp;published in three volumes from 1618 to 1621, after he had discovered his third law and done a substantial amount of the work reducing Tycho’s observational data to planetary tables, the&nbsp;<em>Rudolphine Tables</em>&nbsp;published in 1627 and on which he had begun to work as Tycho was still alive, that he demonstrated all three laws for all the known planets.</p>



<p>I will now return to that third law and the&nbsp;<em>Harmonice mundi</em>&nbsp;(1619) in which it first appeared. Kepler had already suggested the possibility of fine tuning the&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>&nbsp;model with the Pythagorean concept of a harmony of the spheres and this is what his magnus opus&nbsp;<em>Harmonice mundi</em>&nbsp;was. He had already conceived it in the late 1590s but because of other commitments didn’t actually get round to writing it until the second decade of the seventeenth century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having created his harmony of the spheres, in 1621&nbsp;Kepler published an expanded second edition of&nbsp;<em>Mysterium&nbsp;Cosmographicum</em>, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication, so far from abandoning his first theory to produce his elliptical orbits as Seigel claims, Kepler spent his whole life working to improve it.</p>



<p>What is truly bizarre is that Siegel appears to be aware of this fact. He writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It cannot be emphasized enough what an achievement this is for science. Yes, there are many reasons to be critical of Kepler. He continued to promote his&nbsp;<em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>&nbsp;even though it was clear ellipses fit the data better. He continued to mix astronomy with astrology, becoming the most famous astrologer of his time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As already explained in detail, he didn’t just promote his&nbsp;<em>Mysterium&nbsp;Cosmographicum</em>, he worked very hard for many years to improve it. The statement,&nbsp;<em>becoming the most famous astrologer of his time</em>&nbsp;is another example of hyperbollocks. Kepler was a well-known astrologer in Southern Germany and Austria but&nbsp;<em>the most famous astrologer of his time</em>&nbsp;I hardly think so. I would also note that the modern astro-scientists disdain for astrology, as displayed here by Seigel, displays their ignorance of the history of their own discipline. <em><a href="https://www.forbiddenhistories.com/tag/thony-christie/">Astrology was the driving force behind the developments in astronomy for its first three thousand years of its existence.&nbsp;</a></em></p>



<p>Siegel, like many scientists, who think they can write history of science without doing the detailed research, has taken a set of half facts, embroidered them with stuff that he simply made up and created a nice fairy tale that has very little to do with real history of science. A fairy tale that will be swallowed by his large fan base, who will believe it and make life difficult for real historians of science.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>It is a mere 152 words long, not much room for errors, one might think, but one would be wrong.</p>



<p>We start with the heading. The title of Galileo’s book is <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em> and there one really shouldn’t shorten Nuncius to Nunc, as this actually changes the meaning from&nbsp;<em>message</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>messenger</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>now</em>! Also, it is Sider<strong>e</strong>us not Sider<strong>i</strong>us!</p>



<p>Addendum: A reader on Twitter, more observant than I, has pointed out, correctly, that 1609 and 1610 are in the seventeenth century and not the sixteenth century as stated by Clemens.</p>



<p>In the first line Clemens writes:&nbsp;<em>Galileo’s first printed images of the moon, the first ever made with the benefit of the telescope</em>. I shall be generous and assume that with this ambiguous phrase he means first ever printed images made with the benefit of the telescope. If, however, he meant first ever images made with the benefit of the telescope, then he would be wrong as that honour goes Thomas Harriot.</p>



<p>The real hammer comes in the next sentence, where he writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>For the first time, most Europeans were shown the dark side of the moon.</em><em></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first time I read this, I did a double take, could a curator of the Beinecke really have written something that mind bogglingly stupid? By definition the dark side of the moon is the side of the moon that can never be seen from the earth. The first images of it were made, not by Galileo in 1609, after all how could he, but by the Soviet Luna 3 space probe in 1959, 350 years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problems don’t end here, he writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Galileo’s sketches also emphasize its barren and rocky nature—well known to us today, but something of a revelation in the sixteenth century,&nbsp;when most people thought of the moon as another planet, thus generating its own light.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the geocentric system the moon was indeed regarded as one of the seven planets, but in the heliocentric system, which Galileo promoted, it had become a satellite of the earth and was no longer considered a planet. There was a long and complicated discussion throughout the history of astronomy as to whether the planets generated their own light or not. However, within Western astronomy there was a fairy clear consensus that the moon reflected sunlight rather than generating its own light. A brief sketch of the history of this knowledge starts with Anaxagoras (d. 428 BCE). The great Islamic polymath Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) clearly promoted that the moon reflected sunlight. In the century before Galileo, Leonardo (1452–1519) in his moon studies clearly stated that the moon was illuminated by reflected sunlight. However, he never published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe, Clemens is confusing this with the first recognition of the true cause of earth shine, the faint light reflected from the earth that makes the whole moon visible during the first crescent, a recognition that is often falsely attributed to Galileo. However, here the laurels go to Leonardo but who, as always, didn’t publish. The first published correct account was made by Michael Mästlin (1550–1631)</p>



<p>&nbsp;Clemens’ next statement appears to me to be simply bizarre:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Galileo was the first person to accurately depict the moons of Jupiter (which he called “Medicean stars,” after his patron, the Florentine Medici family).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Galileo was the first to discover the moons of Jupiter,<a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/one-day-later/"> just one day ahead of Simon Marius</a>, but to state that he&nbsp;<em>accurately depicted</em>&nbsp;them is somewhat more than an exaggeration. For Galileo and Marius, the moons of Jupiter were small points of light in the sky, the positions of which they recorded as ink dots on a piece of paper. To call this accurate depiction is a joke.</p>



<p>Somehow, I expect a higher standard of public information from the Beinecke Library, one of the world’s leading rare book depositories. </p>

<p>Short popular presentations of the history of the origins of modern physics usually consist of three sections. In ancient Greece, Aristotle got almost everything wrong. In the Middle Ages, people clung religiously to Aristotle’s wrong theories. Then came Galileo and everything was light! A somewhat, sarcastic exaggeration but pretty close to the truth of what people like to believe and believe is the right verb because it bears little relation to what actually happened. You will note in my little parody that there is no mention of the Renaissance. This is because it just gets subsumed into the amorphous Middle Ages in this version of history. Galileo is always presented as a sort of messiah single handily casting a shining light into the dark reaches of medieval Aristotelianism and bringing forth, in a sort of virgin, birth modern physics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, whilst the considerations of what became modern physics are based on the concepts of Aristotle, there were major developments between the fourth century BCE and the early seventeenth century, especially during the Renaissance, changes of which Galileo was well aware and on which he built his, not always correct, contributions. In what follows I’m going to briefly outline the evolution of the theories of motion from Aristotle down to the seventeenth century; the theories of motion that then emerged being the bedrock on which Isaac Newton constructed his physics.</p>



<p>When talking of the history of physics it is important to note that what Aristotle meant with the term, one that he coined, is very different to the modern meaning, one that only began to emerge in the eighteenth century. For Aristotle his&nbsp;<em>ta physika</em>&nbsp;literally means “the natural things” and his physics means the study of all of nature, a study that is also non-mathematical. For Aristotle the objects of mathematics do not describe anything real, so mathematics can not be used to describe the real world. He does allow the use of mathematics in the so-called mixed sciences–astronomy, optics, harmonics (music or more accurately acoustics)–all of which we would include, at least in part, in a general definition of physics but for Aristotle were not part of his&nbsp;<em>ta physika</em>.</p>



<p>Central to Aristotle’s theory of nature was the establishment of the general principle of change that governs all natural bodies. For Aristotle motion is quite simply change of place. Aristotle complicates this simple picture in that he differentiates between celestial and terrestrial motion and between natural and violent or unnatural motion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simplest is his description of natural celestial motion, which is uniform circular motion, a concept that he inherited from Empedocles (c. 494&nbsp;– c. 434&nbsp;BCE,&nbsp;fl.&nbsp;444–443 BCE) via his teacher Plato (c.425 BCE – 348/347 BCE). There is no violent or unnatural celestial motion. Aristotle’s theory of celestial motion is cosmology not astronomy and therefore not mathematical. The attempts to describe that motion mathematically are astronomical and thus not part of Aristotle’s physics.</p>



<p>Unlike celestial motion, both natural and violent terrestrial motion exist. For Aristotle, natural terrestrial motion is always perpendicular to the Earth’s surface and is the result of the four elements-earth, water, air, fire (another concept inherited from Empedocles)–striving to return to the natural places. So, the light elements–air and fire–travel upwards away from the Earth’s surface and the heavy elements–water and earth–fall downwards towards the Earth’s surface. In Latin this indication of heaviness is termed gravitas, object consisting principally of earth and/or water have gravitas and so they fall downwards.</p>



<p>Violent terrestrial motion is any motion that is not natural motion and must be brought about by the application of force. Simplified for something to move, other than falling, it has to be pulled or pushed. For Aristotle, the only contactless motion is the fall of water and earth due to gravitas and the rise of air and fire to their natural place in the world, all other motion requires contact between the object being moved and whoever or whatever is doing the moving. As with much of Aristotle’s philosophy these concepts are based on empirical observation of the real world and are not so wrong, as they are often painted. Aristotle does not have a quantitative law of fall, but he asserts that objects fall at speed proportion to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are falling through. This is often contrasted with Galileo’s “correct” law of fall that all objects fall at the same speed, but Galileo’s law is only valid for a vacuum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aristotle has major problems with projectile motion. If you throw a ball or shoot and arrow, then according to Aristotle, as soon as the ball leaves your hand or the arrow the bowstring then it should immediately stop moving and fall to the ground, which it very obviously doesn’t. He got round the problem by claiming that the projectile parts the air as it flies, which then rushed round to the back of the object to prevent a vacuum forming and pushes the projectile forwards. An explanation that people found difficult to swallow and I suspect that even Aristotle found it less than satisfactory.</p>



<p>It is exactly here in his theory of projectile motion that Aristotle’s theories of terrestrial motion were first challenged and that already in the sixth century CE by the Alexandrian philosopher John Philoponus (c. 490–c. 570). Philoponus broke with the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic tradition of his own times and subjected Aristotle to severe criticism, writing commentaries on many of Aristotle’s major works and most importantly on Aristotle’s Physics. Whilst in general accepting Aristotle’s concept that for violent movement to take place a force must be applied but supplemented it by writing that in the case of projectiles, they acquired a motive power from the source providing the initial projection, which dissipated over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Philoponus didn’t restrict his concept to projectile motion, he also thought that the planets in their orbits had acquired the same motive when set in motion at the creation. Philoponus also rejects Aristotle’s theory of fall. It is obvious that one stone twice as heavy as another falls twice as fast. He apparently backed this up by doing empirical experiments. Showing that stones of differing weights fall at almost the same speed.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>but this [view of Aristotle] is completely erroneous, and our view may be completely corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights, one many times heavier than the other you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend [solely] on the weights, but that the difference in time is very small. …</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Because he fell into disgrace with the Church because of his religious writings, Philoponus’ Aristotle commentaries were little read in the West in the Early Middle Ages. However, they were read by Islamic scholars, such as&nbsp;Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037) (Avicenne), al-Baghdādī&nbsp;(c. 1080–1164), and&nbsp;al-Bitruji (died c. 1204), all adopted and modified Philoponus’ theory of projectile motion.</p>

<p>Whether directly from medieval manuscripts or through transmission by the translation movement, Philoponus’ work was known in Europe in the High Middle Ages. Amongst others, Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) referenced but rejected it. It was the French scholastic philosopher, Jean Buridan (c. 1301–c. 1360), who adopted it and gave it both its final form and its name, impetus. Unlike Philoponus and his Islamic supporters, who thought that the implied motive force simply dissipated spontaneously over time, Buridan argued that the projectile was slowed and eventually brought to a halt by air resistance and gravity opposing its impetus. In Buridan’s more sophisticated version of Philoponus’ theory one can already see the seeds of the theory of inertia.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When a mover sets a body in motion he implants into it a certain impetus, that is, a certain force enabling a body to move in the direction in which the mover starts it, be it upwards, downwards, sidewards, or in a circle. The implanted impetus increases in the same ratio as the velocity. It is because of this impetus that a stone moves on after the thrower has ceased moving it. But because of the resistance of the air (and also because of the gravity of the stone) which strives to move it in the opposite direction to the motion caused by the impetus, the latter will weaken all the time. Therefore the motion of the stone will be gradually slower, and finally the impetus is so diminished or destroyed that the gravity of the stone prevails and moves the stone towards its natural place. In my opinion one can accept this explanation because the other explanations prove to be false whereas all phenomena agree with this one.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Buridan, like Philoponus and al-Bitruji, thought that impetus most the motive force of the planets, there being in the celestial sphere no air resistance of gravity to weaken it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impetus was established as the accepted theory of projectile motion at the beginning of the sixteenth century and it was the theory that&nbsp;Niccolò Fontana (c. 1500–1557), better known by his nickname, Tartaglia, used in his mathematical analysis of ballistics, his&nbsp;<em>Nova scientia</em>&nbsp;(1537), the first such book on the topic. </p>

<p>Here we have a classic example of Renaissance science, the application of the scientific approach to an artisanal practice, gunnery. Because he was using the theory of impetus and not the theory of inertia, Tartaglia’s theories of the flight path of cannon balls is wrong, but his book was widely read and highly influential, Galileo owned a heavily annotated copy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Philoponus had also criticised Aristotle’s theory of fall and he was by no means the last medieval scholar to do so. The so-called Oxford Calculatores&nbsp;at Merton College, Thomas Bradwardine (c. 1300–1349), William of Heytesbury (c. 1313–c. 1372), Richard Swineshead (fl. c. 1340–1354) and John Dumbleton (c. 1310–c. 1349)–studied mechanics distinguishing between kinematics and dynamics, emphasising the former and investigating instantaneous velocity. </p>

<p>They were the first to formulate the mean speed theorem, an achievement usually accredited to Galileo. The mean speed theorem states that a uniformly accelerated body, starting from rest, travels the same distance as a body with uniform speed, whose speed in half the final velocity of the accelerated body. The theory lies at the heart of the laws of fall.</p>



<p>Nicole Oresme (c. 1320–1382), a Parisian colleague of Jean Buridan, in his own work on the concept of motion produced a graphical representation of the mean speed theorem, </p>

<p>as did&nbsp;Giovanni di Casali (c. 1320–after 1374), a Franciscan friar, who encountered the mathematical physics of the Oxford Calculatores, whilst working as a lecturer at Cambridge University around 1340. He wrote a treatise on his ideas on motion in 1346, which was published as&nbsp;<em>De velocitate motus alterationis</em>&nbsp;(On the Velocity of the Motion of Alteration) in Venice in 1351. His work on mathematical physics influenced scholars at the University of Padua&nbsp;and possibly later Galileo.</p>

<p>The most important work on the theories of motion by a Renaissance scholar is that of&nbsp;Giambattista Benedetti (1530–1590), a one-time pupil of Tartaglia. Addressing the law of fall, Benedetti in his&nbsp;<em>Demonstratio proportionum motuum localium</em>&nbsp;(1554) he argued that speed is dependent not on weight but specific gravity and that two objects of the same material, but different weights would fall at the same speed. </p>

<p>Benedetti brought an early version of the thought experiment, usually attributed to Galileo, of viewing two bodies falling separately or conjoined, in his case by a cord.&nbsp; Galileo considered a roof tile falling complete and then broken into two. Benedetti’s work was all done within the theory of impetus. Galileo’s first work on the topic, the unpublished&nbsp;<em>De motu</em>, written whilst he was still at the University of Pisa, also assumes the impetus theory and bears a strong resemblance to Benedetti’s work, which raises the question to what extent Galileo was acquainted with it. The opinions of the historians are divided on the topic.</p>



<p>Whereas Galileo almost certainly never threw balls off the Tower of Pisa, Simon Stevin (1548–1620), the mathematical engineer living and working in the newly established United Provinces, actually dropped lead balls of different weights from the thirty-foot-high church tower in Delft and determined empirically that they fell at the same speed, arriving at the ground at the same time. Stevin’s work was translated into both French and Latin and was widely read and highly influential in the France of Descartes, Mersenne, Gassendi et al.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a significant list of Renaissance scholars who reached and published the same conclusion, the Dominican priest Domingo de Soto (1494–1560) in Spain, Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), Benedetto Varchi (c. 1502–1565), Giuseppe Moletti (1531–1588) and Jacopo Mazzoni (1548–1598) in Italy. Girolamo Borro (1512–1592) one of Galileo’s teachers in Pisa, actually carried out empirical experiments to test Aristotle’s laws of fall, throwing objects of different material and the same weights out of a high window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As can be seen from the above, when Galileo started working on the problems of motion towards the end of the sixteenth century, when he was still very much a Renaissance scientist, he was building on a strong tradition of criticisms and corrections to the Aristotelian theories stretching back to the early Middle Ages but also particularly vibrant in the sixteenth century. As already noted, Galileo earliest unpublished work,&nbsp;<em>De Motu</em>, was firmly entrenched in that tradition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, Galileo would go on to make significant advances in both projectile motion and the laws of fall but in the first he was definitely strongly influenced by another Renaissance mathematician, the Urbino aristocrat, Guidobaldo del Monte (1545–1607). Del Monte was one of the influential figures the young Galileo turned too for assistance at the beginning of his career. Impressed by the young Tuscan, Del Monte helped him to his appointment as professor for mathematics at the University of Pisa and again when he moved to the University of Padua.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Galileo’s major contribution to the theory of projectile motion was the law of the parabola i.e., that the path of a projectile traces out a parabola. Galileo presents this in his&nbsp;<em>Discorsi</em>&nbsp;in 1638. However, it can be found in a notebook of del Monte’s from 1601, with a description of the proofs for this that are identical to those published by Galileo thirty-seven years later. The charitable explanation is that the two of them made this discovery together during one of Galileo’s visits to del Monte’s estate. The less charitable one is that Galileo borrowed del Monte’s results without acknowledgement, not the only time he would do such a thing.</p>



<p>The English polymath, Thomas Harriot (c.1560–1621) discovered the parabola law independently of del Monte/Galileo, but as with everything else didn’t publish his discovery. Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598–1647) did publish the parabola law, and in fact did so before Galileo, which brought an accusation of plagiarism from Galileo. Whether he borrowed the law from Galileo or discovered it independently is not known.</p>

<p>On the laws of fall, Galileo carried out his famous series of experiments using an inclined plane to verify what many others had confirmed during the preceding century. Here the problem is that his inclined plane would not give the level of accuracy of the results that he published. This led the historian of science and Galileo expert, Alexander Koryé (1892–1964), to hypothesise that the inclined plane was a purely hypothetical experiment that Galileo never actually carried out. The modern consensus is that Galileo did in fact carry out his experiments but massaged his results to make them fit the required theoretical values. As we have seen the&nbsp;mean speed theorem was already well established, as was the principle that objects of different weights fall at the same speed.</p>



<p>Galileo’s supposed other great contribution was the law of inertia. Moving from impetus to inertia was the major breakthrough in concepts of motion in the history of physics as it turns the whole problem on its head. Whereas Aristotle asked what moves things, the principle of inertia asks what stops them moving. Aristotle takes still stand as the natural state of objects that has to be changed, inertia takes motion of as the natural state of objects that has to be changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is interesting to note that the supposedly modern scientist Galileo was in this concept trapped in the Greek paradigm of uniform circular motion being natural motion. Because of this, Galileo only defined inertia for circular motion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“…all external impediments removed, a heavy body on a spherical surface concentric with the earth will maintain itself in that state in which it has been; if placed in a movement towards the west (for example), it will maintain itself in that movement.&#8221;<a href="//0A5146BF-E2C6-463C-9E29-8B9779D76B61#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Galileo&#8217;s addiction to the concept of uniform circular motion is also clear in his <em>Dialogo</em>, where he completely ignored Kepler&#8217;s laws of planetary motion, with their elliptical orbits maintaining the Copernican deferent-epicycle model</p>



<p>The Netherlander, Isaac Beeckman (1588–1637) had independently developed the concept of inertia already in 1614 and unlike Galileo he applied it to both circular and linear motion. Although, like Harriot, Beeckman never published, his work was well known to the physicist in Paris especially Descartes (1596–1650), Mersenne (1588–1648) and Gassendi (1592–1655). Newton (1642–1727) took the principle of inertia from Descarte, and not from Galileo as is often falsely claimed as his first law, and Descarte had it from Beeckman. Beeckman was an archetypal Renaissance scientist, an artisan who turned his attention to empirical experiments and science.</p>



<p>When one looks below the surface of the superficial accounts of the history of physics, it become clear the Renaissance scholar contributed substantially to the development of the theories of motion in the period leading up to the so-called scientific revolution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the normal blog post rotation, a book review should be due today. However, instead today’s post is a literature review, listing and describing books on the histories of the theories of vision, spectacles, and telescopes, with the latter coming first as they are the actual main theme of the review. I announced my intention to do this is response to a regular readers request, so long ago I’ve forgotten when, and I was recently reminded of that announcement when someone on Twitter asked me if one of the history of the telescope books, which I own is any good; it is as I will explain later.</p>



<p>The classical standard text on the early history of the telescope is Albert van Helden’s&nbsp;<em>The Invention of the Telescope</em>, which was first published as a paper in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society in 1977 but has long been available as a monograph, the second edition appearing in 2008 to celebrate the 400<sup>th</sup>anniversary of the invention of the telescope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Van Helden presents and analyses all of the early literature related to the emergence of the telescope in the first decade of the seventeenth century, as well as earlier descriptions of instruments similar to the telescope that proceeded it His text contains full quotes from the original literature in their source languages followed by English translations. It is justifiably called a classic and is a must read for anybody seriously studying the history of the telescope.</p>



<p>Van Helden’s text includes the historical references to Zacharias Janssen (1585–before 1632), as one of the candidates for the invention of the telescope. In 2008, there was a big conference in Middelburg, in the Netherlands, where the telescope first emerged, to celebrate that 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary; I was there! In the conference proceedings, <em>The origins of</em> <em>the telescope</em> (edited by Albert van Helden, Sven Dupré, Rob van Gent, Huib Zuidervaart, and published by KNAW Press, Amsterdam, 2010) there is a paper by Huib J. Zuidervaart, <em>The ‘true inventor’ of the telescope</em>. <em>A survey of 400 years of debate</em>, <em>which clearly shows that </em>Zacharias Janssen was not an inventor of the telescope. </p>

<p>The entire proceedings contain an amazing collection of papers on all possible aspects of the history of the telescope by an all star cast of the world’s best historians of optics. It is available as a printed book <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/5158315/the-origins-of-the-telescope-dwc-knaw">but is also available as an open access e-book online.</a></p>



<p>The two books I’ve described so far only really deal with the origins of the telescope; we now turn our attention to books that delve further into the history of the telescope. A classic that is substantially older than van Helden’s&nbsp;<em>The Invention of the Telescope</em>&nbsp;is Henry King’s&nbsp;<em>The History of the Telescope</em>, which was originally published by Charles Griffin &amp; Co. Ltd. In 1955 and then republished by Dover in 1979.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It opens with a short chapter on the beginning of astronomical observation that is followed by an even shorter chapter on the history of lenses and optics that ends with Lipperhey and his invention of the refracting telescope, with the rival claims of Metius and Jansen. There follows chapter for chapter a chronological history of telescopes and their user and uses beginning with Galileo and ending around 1950 with the construction of the Jodrell Bank radio telescope. Despite the fact that it is dated, it is well researched and well written and can still be read with profit.</p>



<p>More up to date is Fred Watson’s&nbsp;<em>Stargazer the life and times of the Telescope</em>&nbsp;(Da Capo Press, 2005). </p>

<p>As with King, Watson opens with the pre-telescopic era and the various reports of things that might have been telescope but probably weren’t prior to 1608 and Lipperhey. </p>

<p>He then takes his reader on an episodic journey through the history of the telescope down to the present day, ending with plans and discussion of a new generation of super telescopes. A well-researched and well written book, which I found a pleasure to read and highly informative. </p>



<p>I managed an absolute classic in Middelburg in 2008. I got into a conversation with another participant at the conference and during the exchange started to talk about something from Watson’s book blithely unaware that my conversation partner was the man himself! Mildly embarrassing but also somewhat amusing.</p>



<p>For those readers, who are interested but don’t want to plough their way through a dense academic tome on the history of the telescope but would prefer something more digestible, I heartily recommend Richard Dunn’s The Telescope:&nbsp;<em>A Short History</em>&nbsp;(National Maritime Museum, 2009, Conway, 2011).</p>

<p>Dunn was then curator at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, which has its own excellent collection of telescopes, and is now Keeper of Technologies and Engineering at the Science Museum. The chapters of his book are more topic orientated rather than purely chronological. Beautifully illustrated, it is a comparatively light introduction to the history of the telescope, as I said ideal for those interested but not necessarily prepared to take a deep dive into the subject. This was the book I got asked about recently on Twitter. </p>

<p>This is actually a catalogue of an exhibition that Bolt curated at the Adler upon his return from the 2008 conference in Middelburg. I will quote Bolt’s brief description of the exhibition in full because it captures the general concept of all of the history of the telescope texts:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The exhibition and catalogue address four themed zones. The first, the pretelescope zone, addresses ways in which people have looked at the sky and tried to make sense of it, using their surrounding landscapes or relatively simple tools to develop an understanding or model of the Universe. Zone two presents the invention of the telescope, the challenges it brought to the Earth-centered Universe, and the beautiful craftsmanship and ornamentation of some of the earliest surviving examples in the world. In zone three, the technical challenges of improving telescopes led to variations in design and materials; the telescopes also became popular devices with brand-name recognition. Zone four displays the culmination of the refracting telescope and the emergence of spectroscopy, leading to the marvels of modern telescopes: some see wavelengths beyond the optical realm, others detect invisible particles, a few compensate for atmospheric turbulence, while still others travel beyond the Earth’s atmosphere into space.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Each exhibit is illustrated with a description on the facing page. If you can find a copy, it’s a great introduction to the history of the telescope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ‘if you can find a copy’, illustrates a major problem with this bibliography. Because they only have a limited appeal and target readership, many of the books I am describing are out of print and you have to hunt around to find second-hand copies. Several of mine were bought second-hand.</p>



<p>Galileo, of course, gets a whole telescope bibliography to himself. I’ll start with Eileen Reeves’ excellent&nbsp;<em>Galileo’s Glassworks</em>&nbsp;(Harvard University Press, 2008). </p>

<p>There was a significant gap between Galileo first hearing about the new invention from the Netherlands and the manufacture of his own first telescope. In her book Reeves argues convincingly that Galileo at first thought that the new instrument was somehow based on mirrors and spent substantial time and effort trying to work out how. Reeves backs this up with a detailed account of the history of (magical) mirrors that allowed their owners to see great distances. </p>

<p>The book also contains much information on the critical period before and during the early period of telescope manufacture. A fascinating, thoroughly researched, and beautifully book.</p>



<p><em>Galileo’s Telescopes</em>:&nbsp;<em>A European Story</em>&nbsp;(Harvard University Press, 2015) by Massimo Bucciantini, Michele Camerota, and Franco Giudice and translated by Catherine Bolton describes in great detail the spread of the influence of Galileo’s publications on his telescopic discoveries and the distribution of the instruments that he manufactured throughout Europe and the influence that he exercised thereby. </p>

<p>In the earlier book Biagioli basically presents Galileo as a social climber, who uses his scientific career to win status within the political climate of Northern and Middle Italy at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Hustling for status and favour, Biagioli argues, I think correctly, that Galileo’s downfall was largely a product of the mechanisms of absolutist politics. Having raised Galileo up as a favourite at his papal court, Maffeo Barberini, Pope Urban VIII, then cast him down as a demonstration of his absolute power during a period of political crisis. This treatment of court favourites was quite common in absolutist regimes throughout Europe.</p>



<p>In his second volume, Biagioli shows how Galileo, having become the telescope man throughout Europe, through the publication of his <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em> in 1610, manufactured telescopes together with his instrument maker, who usually gets left out of the story, and distributed them as favours throughout Europe. </p>

<p>However, he did not give them to other mathematicians and astronomers, who could have used them to confirm Galileo’s discoveries or made new ones of their own, but to powerful figures within the Catholic Church and political potentates, in order to raise his own social status. In his defence it should be pointed out Galileo was not alone in doing this. It was common practice for Renaissance mathematici to design and manufacture high class scientific instruments as gifts for potential aristocratic patrons.</p>



<p>Both of Biagioli’s books are excellent and highly recommended for anybody interested in Galileo, his telescopes, his telescopic discoveries, and his use of them within a socio-politic context rather than a scientific one.</p>



<p>Having looked briefly at the social, political, and cultural contexts of the telescope and Galileo’s use of the instrument and his discoveries, it should be obvious that the advent of the telescope and its impact was not just scientific. Two further books by Eileen Reeves investigate the impact of the new culture of visual awareness in two non-scientific areas.</p>



<p>Her&nbsp;<em>Painting the Heavens</em>:&nbsp;<em>Art and Science in the Age of Galileo</em>&nbsp;(Princeton University Press, 1997) explores the impact that the new telescopic astronomical discoveries had on the work of a group of leading contemporary artists. </p>

<p>The weekly newssheets began to emerge in Early Modern Europe almost simultaneously with the invention of the telescope and the publication of Galileo’s <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em>. To quote the publishers blurb:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Early modern news writers and consumers often understood journalistic texts in terms of recent developments in optics and astronomy, Reeves demonstrates, even as many of the first discussions of telescopic phenomena such as planetary satellites, lunar craters, sunspots, and comets were conditioned by accounts of current events. She charts how the deployment of particular technologies of vision—the telescope and the camera obscura—were adapted to comply with evolving notions of objectivity, censorship, and civic awareness. Detailing the differences between various types of printed and manuscript news and the importance of regional, national, and religious distinctions,&nbsp;<em>Evening News</em>&nbsp;emphasizes the ways in which information moved between high and low genres and across geographical and confessional boundaries in the first decades of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Changing direction, the man who is credited with being the first to publicly present a working telescope Hans Lipperhey (c. 1570–1619) in Middelburg in 1608, was a professional spectacle maker. This is in no way surprising as spectacle makers were the artisans, who worked with lenses. This means if one wants to understand the invention of the telescope, one must also take a look at the history of spectacles. Above all one needs to answer the questions, how did spectacle come to be invented and given that spectacles first emerged in the late thirteenth century, why did it take more than two hundred years before somebody invented the telescope? </p>



<p>There are two books that answer these questions in great detail of which the first is Rolf Willach’s magisterial <em>Long Route to the Invention of the Telescope</em>:&nbsp;<em>A Life of Influence and Exile</em>&nbsp;(American Philosophical Society, 2008), like van Helden’s<em>&nbsp;The Invention of the Telescope</em>, published in English both as a journal article in the society’s transactions and as a separate monograph.</p>

<p>For those of my readers&nbsp;who can&nbsp;read German this volume contains a large collection of excellent papers on the history of the telescope. A couple of them are even in English.</p>



<p>The number of different publications of&nbsp;Willach’s&nbsp;essay signify its ground-breaking status in the histories of spectacles and telescopes. Based on his very extensive empirical investigations he hypothesises that the invention of spectacles was made by monks working in medieval cloisters, cutting and polishing gemstones to decorate reliquaries, the containers for holy relics. At the other end of the two hundred years, he showed that the clue to constructing a successful telescope lay in stopping down the eyepiece lens with a mask. This is because early lenses were inaccurately ground, and the outer edges of the lens distorted the image. By masking off the outer edges, the image became comparatively sharp and usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Equally impressive is Vincent Ilardi’s&nbsp;<em>Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes</em>&nbsp;(Memoires of the American Philosophical Society, Band 259, 2007). </p>

<p>This is the definitive account of the Early Modern history of spectacles. Ilardi was a diplomatic historian, who studied a vast convolute of trade documents and correspondence in order to reconstruct the history of spectacles in the first two centuries of their existence. I have read this book twice but do not own a copy as it is prohibitively expensive, thank God for libraries. Iladi should have held a lecture in Middelburg in September 2008 but he was already dying of prostate cancer, which deprived the world of his excellence in January 2009.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The histories of spectacles and telescopes are, of course, just integral parts of the much wider history of optics. Optics was originally the theory of vision, how do we see? How do our eyes perceive the world around us bringing information of everything within our field of vision into our brain for processing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The absolute classic, which outlines the various theories developed from the ancient Greeks down to Johannes Kepler at the beginning of the seventeenth century and the advent of the telescope is David C. Lindberg’s&nbsp;<em>Theories of</em>&nbsp;<em>Vision from Al-Kindi to Kepler</em>&nbsp;(University of Chicago Press, 1976). </p>

<p>Popular wisdom claims that the ancient Greeks believed that we see with a fire that the eyes emit to touch and illuminate the objects seen. This is in simplistic form the extramission theory of vision of Plato. Lindberg explains that this was only one of several extramission and intromission (rays entering the eyes) theories of vision held by different individuals and schools of philosophy in ancient Greece. He also presents the geometric opticians–Euclid, Ptolemaeus, Heron–who propagated a mathematical extramission theory. </p>

<p>Moving on he shows how these theories were assimilated by Islamic scholars and how al-Kindi supported a Euclidian extramission theory but also developed his punctiform theory of reflection, which states that light is reflected from every point on an object in every direction. Enter al-Haytham, who produced a synthesis of an intromission theory, geometrical optics, and al-Kindi’s punctiform theory of reflection, which when translated into Latin in the thirteenth century became the so-called perspectivist theory, which led the field in Europe right down to Kepler. Lindberg sees Kepler as the last of the perspectivists. The book is a historical tour de force. If you are really interested, Lindberg has a long list of excellent academic papers investigating individual topics in medieval optics.</p>



<p>Even an absolute classic can be surpassed, and this has happened to Lindberg’s masterpiece. A. Mark Smith was a doctoral student of Lindberg’s and followed in his master’s footsteps becoming a brilliant historian of optics. His synthesis is&nbsp;<em>From Sight to Light</em>&nbsp;(University of Chicago Press, 2015). </p>

<p>His narrative follows that of Lindberg, but in greater detail and including many figure that Lindberg did not feature. The biggest difference come at the end, unlike Lindberg, he does not consider Kepler the last of the perspectivists but rather the first of a new direction in the optics. He argues his case very convincingly and I think he in probably correct. </p>

<p>If I were to recommend just one of the two, then it would have to be Smith and that despite the fact that the Lindberg was one of those turning point books in my own development. Of course, I think you should read both of them! Smith, like his mentor, has a very long list of papers and book on optics, all of which are recommended reading.</p>



<p>Both Lindberg and Smith stop at the beginning of the seventeenth century, although Smith has a short capital at the end sketching the further developments during the century. If you want to follow the story further then I recommend Oliver Darrigol’s <em>A History of Optics</em>: <em>From Greek Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century</em> (OUP, 2012). </p>

<p>Darrigol deals with the passage from the Greeks to Kepler in the first thirty-six pages of his books and devotes the rest to developing the story from there down to the end of the nineteenth century with Stoke, Poincare et al.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I noted above when talking about Galileo and his telescopic discoveries, the new possibilities revealed by the new instruments and the new theories of optics went well beyond the boundaries of science touching on other areas such as culture, politics and society. They literally changed people’s perceptions of the world in which they lived. I will briefly mention three books which deal with this, a by no means exhaustive list. </p>



<p>The first one that I read was Svetlana Alpers’&nbsp;<em>The Art of Describing</em>:&nbsp;<em>Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century</em>(University of Chicago Press, 1984). </p>

<p>As we have already seen with Eileen Revees’&nbsp;<em>Painting the Heavens</em>:&nbsp;<em>Art and Science in the Age ofGalileo</em>&nbsp;art visually reflected the new developments in optics. To quote a review of Alpers’ book:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The art historian after Erwin Panofsky and Ernst Gombrich is not only participating in an activity of great intellectual excitement; he is raising and exploring issues which lie very much at the centre of psychology, of the sciences and of history itself. Svetlana Alpers&#8217;s study of 17th-century Dutch painting is a splendid example of this excitement and of the centrality of art history among current disciples. Professor Alpers puts forward a vividly argued thesis. There is, she says, a truly fundamental dichotomy between the art of the Italian Renaissance and that of the Dutch masters. . . . Italian art is the primary expression of a &#8216;textual culture,&#8217; this is to say of a culture which seeks emblematic, allegorical or philosophical meanings in a serious painting. Alberti, Vasari and the many other theoreticians of the Italian Renaissance teach us to &#8216;read&#8217; a painting, and to read it in depth so as to elicit and construe its several levels of signification. The world of Dutch art, by the contrast, arises from and enacts a truly &#8216;visual culture.&#8217; It serves and energises a system of values in which meaning is not &#8216;read&#8217; but &#8216;seen,&#8217; in which new knowledge is visually recorded.&#8221;—George Steiner,&nbsp;<em>Sunday Times</em></p>

<p>My second book is Stuart Clark’s&nbsp;<em>Vanities of the Eye</em>:&nbsp;<em>Vision in Early Modern European Culture</em>&nbsp;(OUP, 2007). </p>

<p>Once again to quote the back cover blurb:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Vanities of the Eye investigates the cultural history of the senses in early modern Europe, a time in which the nature and reliability of human vision was the focus of much debate. In medicine, art theory, science, religion, and philosophy, sight came to be characterized as uncertain or paradoxical-mental images no longer resembled the external world. Was seeing really believing? Stuart Clark explores the controversial debates of the time-from the fantasies and hallucinations of melancholia, to the illusions of magic, art, demonic deceptions, and witchcraft. The truth and function of religious images and the authenticity of miracles and visions were also questioned with new vigor, affecting such contemporary works as Macbeth- a play deeply concerned with the dangers of visual illusion. Clark also contends that there was a close connection between these debates and the ways in which philosophers such as Descartes and Hobbes developed new theories on the relationship between the real and virtual. Original, highly accessible, and a major contribution to our understanding of European culture, Vanities of the Eye will be of great interest to a wide range of historians and anyone interested in the true nature of seeing.</p>

<p>Once again resorting to publisher’s blurb:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By the early 17th century the Scientific Revolution was well under way. Philosophers and scientists were throwing off the yoke of ancient authority to peer at nature and the cosmos through microscopes and telescopes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 1632, in the small town of Delft in the Dutch Republic, two geniuses were born who would bring about a seismic shift in the idea of what it meant to see the world. One was Johannes Vermeer, whose experiments with lenses and a camera obscura taught him how we see under different conditions of light and helped him create the most luminous works of art ever beheld. The other was Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, whose work with microscopes revealed a previously unimagined realm of minuscule creatures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By intertwining the biographies of these two men, Laura Snyder tells the story of a historical moment in both art and science that revolutionized how we see the world today.</p>

Peter Louwman is a rich Dutchman, who has a very impressive automobile museum in De Haag. <a href="https://www.louwmanmuseum.nl/stichting-louwman-historic-telescopes/">The museum also houses a massive historical collection of telescopes and binoculars</a>.</p>

<p> For the 400th anniversary conference in Middelburg Louwman produced a wonderful annotated edition of the French newsletter reporting on the visit of the Ambassador of Siam to Den Haag in September 1608, which contains a description of Lipperhey’s demonstration of his telescope to the assembled delegates of the peace conference taking place there. </p>

<p>Every participant in the conference received a copy and I think it’s the best goody that I’ve every received at a conference. I think for a time it was on sale in the museum shop but that no longer appears to be the case.</p>



<p>Another Louwman publication is a wonderful catalogue of the Louwman Collection of Historic Telescopes,&nbsp;<em>A Certain Instrument for Seeing Far</em>&nbsp;by P.J.K. Louwman and H. J. Zuidervaart (2013), which definitely used to be sold by the museum, because I bought one, but no longer seems to be available.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to impress my readers with all the books that I’ve read on the history of optics and the telescopic but trying to make clear that if you truly want to understand that history, the road that led up to the invention of the telescope, its impact as a scientific instrument, and its impact outside of the direct field of science then you have to extend your scope and dig deep.&nbsp;</p>

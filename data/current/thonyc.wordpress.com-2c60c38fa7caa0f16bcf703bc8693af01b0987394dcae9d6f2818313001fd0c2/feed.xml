										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As we saw in the last episode, Ptolemaeus’&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;enjoyed a strong popularity following its rediscovery and translation into Latin from Greek at the beginning of fifteenth century, going through at least five printed editions before the end of the century. The following century saw several important new translation and revised editions both in Latin and in the vernacular. This initial popularity can at least be partially explained by the fact that Ptolemaeus’&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>&nbsp;and his&nbsp;<em>Tetrabiblos</em>, whilst not without rivals, were the dominant books in medieval astronomy and astrology respectively. But the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>, although, as explained in the previous episode, in some senses related to the other two books, was a book about mapmaking. So how did affect European mapmaking in the centuries after its re-emergence? To answer this question, we first need to look at medieval European, terrestrial mapmaking.</p>



<p>Mapmaking was relatively low level during the medieval period before the fifteenth century and although there were certainly more, only a very small number of maps have survived. These can be divided into three largely distinct categories, regional and local maps, Mappa Mundi, and portolan charts. There are very few surviving regional or local maps from the medieval period and of those the majority are from 1350 or later, mapmaking was obviously not very widespread in the early part of the Middle Ages. There are almost no maps of entire countries, the exceptions being maps of Palestine, </p>

<p>The Mappa Mundi are the medieval maps of the known world. These range from very simple schematic diagrams to the full-blown presentations of the&nbsp;<em>oikoumenikos</em>, the entire world as known to&nbsp;European antiquity, consisting of the three continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa. The sketch maps are mostly of two different types, the zonal maps, and the T-O maps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The zonal maps show just the eastern hemisphere divided by lines into the five climata or climate zones, as defined by Aristotle. These are the northern frigid zone, the northern temperate zone, the equatorial tropical zone, the southern temperate zone, and the southern frigid zone, of which the Greek believed only the two temperate zones were habitable. In the medieval period, zonal maps are mostly found in copies of Macrobius’&nbsp;<em>Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis</em>&nbsp;(<em>Commentary on Cicero&#8217;s Dream of Scipio</em>).</p>

<p>T-O sketch maps show a diagrammatic presentation of the three know continents, Asia, Europe, and Africa enclosed within a double circle representing the ocean surrounding&nbsp;<em>oikoumenikos</em>. The&nbsp;<em>oikoumenikos</em>&nbsp;is orientated, that is with east at the top and is divided into three parts by a T consisting of the Mediterranean, the Nile, and the Danube, with the top half consisting of Asia and the bottom half with Europe on the left and Africa on the right. T-O maps have their origin in the works of Isidore, his&nbsp;<em>De Natura Rerum</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Etymologiae</em>. He writes in&nbsp;<em>De Natura Rerum</em>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>So the earth may be divided into three sides (trifarie), of which one part is Europe, another Asia, and the third is called Africa. Europe is divided from Africa by a sea from the end of the ocean and the Pillars of Hercules. And Asia is divided from Libya with Egypt by the Nile&#8230; Moreover, Asia – as the most blessed Augustine said – runs from the southeast to the north &#8230; Thus we see the earth is divided into two to comprise, on the one hand, Europe and Africa, and on the other only Asia</p></blockquote>

<p>For most people the term Mappa Mundi evokes the large circular, highly coloured maps of the&nbsp;<em>oikoumenikos</em>, packed with symbols and text such as the Hereford and Ebstorf maps, rather that the small schematic ones. </p>

<p>These are basically T-O maps but appear to be geographically very inaccurate. This is because although they give an approximate map of the&nbsp;<em>oikoumenikos</em>, they are not intended to be geographical maps, as we understand them today. So, what are they? The clue can be found in the comparatively large number of regional maps of Palestine, the High Middle Ages is a period where the Catholic Church and Christianity dominated Europe and the Mappa Mundi are philosophical maps depicting the world of Christianity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These maps are literally orientated, that is East at the top and have Jerusalem, the hub of the Christian world, at their centre. The Hereford map has the Garden of Eden at the top in the east, whereas the Ebstrof map, has Christ’s head at the top in the east, his hands on the sides north and south and his feet at the bottom in the south, so that he is literally holding the world. The much smaller Psalter map has Christ above the map in the east blessing the world. </p>

<p>These are not maps of the world but maps of the Christian world. The illustrations and cartouches scattered all over the maps elucidate a motley collection of history, legends and myths that were common in medieval Europe. These Mappa Mundi are repositories of an extensive collection of information, but not the type of geographical knowledge we expect when we hear the word map.</p>



<p>The third area of medieval mapping is the portolan charts, which pose some problems. These are nautical charts that first appeared in the late thirteenth century in the Mediterranean and then over the centuries were extended to other sea areas. They display a detailed and surprising accurate stretch of coastline and are covered with networks of rhumb lines showing compass bearings. </p>

<p>Portolan charts have no coordinates. The major problem with portolan charts is their origin. They display an accuracy, at the time, unknown in other forms of mapping but the oldest known charts are fully developed. There is no known development leading to this type of mapping i.e., there are no known antecedent charts. The second problem is the question, are they based on a projection? There is some discussion on this topic, but the generally accepted view is that they are plate carrée or plane chart projection, which means that the mapmakers assumes that the area to be map is flat. This false assumption is OK if the area being mapped is comparatively small but leads to serios problems of distortion, when applied to larger areas.</p>



<p>Maps, mapping, and map making began to change radically during the Renaissance and one of the principle driving factors of that change was the rediscovery of Ptolemaeus’&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>. It is important to note that the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;was only one factor and there were several others, also this process of change was gradual and drawn out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What did the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;bring to medieval mapmaking that was new? It reintroduced the concept of coordinates, longitude and latitude, as well as map projection. As Ptolemaeus points out the Earth is a sphere, and it is mathematically impossible to flatten out the surface of a sphere onto a flat sheet without producing some sort of distortion. Map projections are literally what they say they are, they are ways of projecting the surface of the sphere onto a flat surface. There are thousands of different projections, and the mapmaker has to choose, which one is best suited to the map that he is drawing. As Ptolemaeus points out for a map of the world, it is actually better not the draw it on a flat sheet but instead to draw it on a globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Geographia </em>contains instructions for drawing a map of the Earth i.e., the&nbsp;<em>oikoumenikos</em>, and for regional maps. For his regional maps Ptolemaeus uses the plate carrée or plane chart projection, the invention of which he attributes to his contemporary Marinus of Tyre. In this projection, the lines of longitude (meridians) and latitude (parallels) are parallel sets of equally spaced lines. For maps of the world, he describes three other projections. The first of these was a simple conic projection in which the surface of the globe is projected onto a cone, tangent to the Earth at the 36<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;parallel. Here the meridians are straight lines that tend to close towards the poles, while the parallels are concentric arcs. The second was a modified cone projection where the parallels are concentric arcs and the meridians curve inward towards the poles.</p>

<p>His third projection, a perspective projection, needn’t interest us here as it was hardly used, however the art historian Samuel Y Edgerton, who died this year, argued that the rediscovery of Ptolemaeus’ third projection at the beginning of the fifteenth century was the impulse that led to Brunelleschi’s invention of linear perspective.</p>

<p>From very early on Renaissance cosmographers began to devise and introduce new map projections, at the beginning based on Ptolemaeus’ projections. For example, in his&nbsp;<em>In Hoc Opere Haec Continentur Nova Translatio Primi Libri Geographicae Cl Ptolomaei</em>, from 1514, Johannes Werner (1468–1522) introduced the heart shaped or cordiform projection devised by his friend and colleague Johannes Stabius (1540–1522), now know as the Werner-Stabius projection. This was used by several mapmakers in the sixteenth century, perhaps most famously by Oronce Fine (1494–1555) in 1536.</p>

<p>It should be noted that prior to the rediscovery of the <em>Geographia</em>, map projection was not unknown in medieval Europe, as the celestial sphere engraved on the tympans or climata of astrolabes are created using a stereographic projection.</p>

<p>The first wave of Renaissance mapmaking concerned the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;itself. As already noted, in the previous episode, the first printed edition with maps appeared in Bologna in 1477. This was closely followed by one produced with copper plate engravings, which appeared in Rome in 1478. An edition with maps printed with woodblocks in Ulm in 1482. Another edition, using the same plates as the 1478 edition appeared in Rome in 1490. Whereas the other fifteenth century edition only contained the twenty-seven maps described by Ptolemaeus in his text, the Ulm edition started a trend, that would continue in later editions, of adding new contemporary maps to the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>. These editions of the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;represent the advent of the modern atlas, to use an anachronistic term, an, at least nominally, uniform collection of maps with text bound together in book. It would be approximately a century before <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/abraham-ortelius-and-the-16th-century-information-age/">the first real modern atlas, that of Abraham Ortelius</a>, would be published, but as Elizabeth Eisenstein observed, the European mapmakers first had to catch up with Ptolemaeus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These printed edition of the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;also illustrate another driving force behind the radical increase in mapmaking during the Renaissance, the invention of the printing press. <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/03/24/renaissance-science-vi/">The invention of the printing press and the development of cooper plate engraving, as well as woodblock printing </a>meant that the multiple reproduction of maps and plans became much easier and also much cheaper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another factor behind the increase in mapmaking was the so-called age of discovery. The Portuguese had been working their way down the coast of Africa throughout the fifteenth century and Bartolomeu Dias (c. 1450–1500) rounded the southern tip of Africa, for the first time in 1488, paving the way for the first trip by a European by an ocean route to India by Vasco da Gama (c. 1460s–1524) in 1497–99. Of course, as every school kid knows “In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue” or put for formally the Genoese seaman Christopher Columbus (1451–1506) undertook his first voyage to Asia in service of the Spanish Crown in 1492 and accidentally discovered the so-called forth continent, which Martin Waldseemüller (c. 1475–1520) and <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/09/05/the-naming-of-america/">Matthias Ringmann (c. 1482–1511) incorrectly christened America in 1507, in honour of Amerigo Vespucci (1451–1512), whom they falsely believed to be the discoverer of the new, to Europeans, continent. </a></p>



<p>The initial maps produced by the European discovery expedition carried the portolan chart tradition out from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic Ocean, down the coast of Africa and eventually across the Atlantic to the coasts of the newly discovered Americas. </p>

<p>Although not really suitable for maps of large areas the tradition of the portolan charts survived well into the seventeenth century. In 1500, Juan de la Cosa (c. 1450–1510) produced a world portolan chart. This is the earliest known map to include a representation of the New World.</p>

<p>The 1508 edition of the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;published in Rome was the first edition to include the European voyages of exploration to the New World. The world map drawn by the Flemish mapmaker Johan Ruysch (c. 1460–1533), who had himself sailed to America, includes the north coast of South America and some of the West Indian islands. On the other side it also includes eastern Asia with China indicated by a city marked as Cathaya, however, Japan (Zinpangu) is not included. </p>

<p>Ruysch’s map bears a strong resemblance to the Cantarini-Rosselli world map published in Venice or Florence in 1506. Drawn by Giovanni Matteo Conarini (died 1507) and engraved by Francesco Rosselli (1455–died before 1513), which was the earliest known printed map containing the New World. The Ruysch map and the Cantarini-Rosselli probably shared a common source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most famous map showing the newly discovered fourth continent is, of course, <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/09/05/the-naming-of-america/">the Waldseemüller world map of 1507, which gave America its name. </a></p>

<p>Of interest here is the fact that Waldseemüller apparently also published a small, printed globe of his wall map, which is the earliest known printed globe.</p>

<p>The age of the modern terrestrial globe was ushered in by the earliest known, surviving manuscript globe produced by Martin Behaim (1549-1507) in 1493. Because he had supposedly taken part on Portuguese expedition along the African coast, <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/der-erdapfel/">he was commissioned, by the city council of Nürnberg, during a visit to the city of his birth,&nbsp;&nbsp;to produce a globe and a large wall map of the world for the council chamber.</a> The map no longer exists. Behaim’s main source for his maps was Ptolemaeus’&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>.</p>

<p>Waldseemüller’s globe had apparently little impact and only four sets of globe gores still exist but none of the finished globes. The person who really set the production of printed globes in motion was the <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2010/05/15/circumnavigating-the-globe/">Nürnberger mathematicus Johannes Schöner (1477–1547)</a>, who produced his first printed terrestrial globe in 1515, which did much to cement the name America given to the fourth continent by Waldseemüller and Ringmann. Schöner was the owner of the only surviving copy of the Waldseemüller map. </p>

<p>Like Behaim and Waldseemüller, Schöner’s main source of information was Ptolemaeus’&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>, of which he owned a heavily annotated copy, and which like them he supplemented with information from various other sources. In 1517, he also produced a matching, printed celestial globe, establishing the tradition of matching globe pairs that persisted down to the nineteenth century.</p>



<p>Schöner was not the only Nürnberger mathematicus, who produced globes. We know that <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/11/25/a-master-instrument-maker-from-a-small-town-in-the-frankischen-schweiz/">Georg Hartmann (1489–1564),</a> who acted as Schöner’s globe salesman in Nürnberg, when Schöner was still living in Kirchehrenbach, also manufactured globes, but none of his have survived. Although they weren’t cheap, it seems that Schöner’s globes sold very well, well enough to motivate others to copy them. Both Waldseemüller, with his map, and Schöner, with his globes, published an accompanying cosmographia, a booklet, consisting of instructions for use as well as further geographical and historical information. An innovative printer/publisher in Louvain reprinted Schöner’s cosmographia,&nbsp;<em>Lucullentissima quaedam terrae totius descriptio</em>, and commissioned <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/05/25/mapping-the-history-of-triangulation/">Gemma Frisius (1508–1555)</a> to make a copy of Schöner’s globe to accompany it. Frisius became a globe maker, as did his one-time student and assistant Gerard Mercator (1512-1594), who went on to become the most successful globe maker in Europe. </p>

<p>Both Willem Janszoon Blaeu (1571–1638) and Jodocus Hondius (1563–1612) emulated Mercator’s work establishing the Netherlands as the major European map and globe making centre in the seventeenth century.</p>



<p>Another factor that contributed to the spread of map making in the sixteenth century was the Renaissance development of realism in painting. <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/04/07/renaissance-science-vii/">This was a combination of the invention of linear perspective during the fifteenth century on the one hand and on the other, the development of Naturalism beginning in the late fourteenth century in the Netherlands.</a> During the sixteenth century many notable artists were also map makers and several map makers were also artists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It became fashionable during the Renaissance for those in power to sponsor and employ those working in the sciences. This patronage also included map makers. On the one hand this meant employing map makes to make maps as status symbols for potentates to display their magnificence. A good example is the map galleries that <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2018/11/28/cosmographer-to-a-grand-duke-and-a-pope/">Egnatio Danti (1536–1586)</a> was commissioned to create in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence for Cosimo I de’ Medici and in the Vatican for Pope Gregory XIII. </p>

<p>Another example is Oronce Fine (1494–1555), who made maps for Francis I. The first English atlas created by <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/saxton-and-speed-two-early-elizabethan-cartographers-and-the-flemish-influence/">Christopher Saxton (c. 1540–c. 1610) </a>was commissioned by Thomas Seckford, Master of Ordinary on the instructions of William Cecil, 1<sup>st</sup>Baron Burghley (1520–1598), Queen Elizabeth’s chief advisor. </p>

<p>These maps came more and more to serve as aids to administration. The latter usage also led to European rulers commissioning maps of their new overseas possessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another area that required map making was the changes in this period in the pursuit of warfare. Larger armies, the increased use of artillery, and a quasi-professionalisation of the infantry led to demand for maps for manoeuvres during military campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting around 1500 mapping took off in Renaissance Europe driven by the various factors that I’ve sketched above, a full account would be much more complex and require a book rather than a blog post. The amount of mapmaking increased steadily over the decades and with it the skill of the mapmakers reaching a first high point towards the end of the century in the atlases of<a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/abraham-ortelius-and-the-16th-century-information-age/"> Ortelius,</a> <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/05/13/a-uniform-collection-of-maps-should-have-been-a-theatre-but-became-an-atlas-instead-but-it-might-have-been-a-mirror/">De Jode</a>, and <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/the-first-atlas/">Mercator</a>. The seventeenth century saw the establishment of a major European commercial map and globe making industry dominated by the Dutch map makers, particularly <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/the-house-of-blaeu-vs-the-house-of-hondius-the-battle-of-the-globes-and-atlases/">the Houses of Blaeu and Hondius.</a></p>

<p></p>



<p>Anna Marie Roos is one of those scholars, who make this historian of Early Modern science feel totally inadequate. Her depth and breadth of knowledge are awe inspiring and her attention to detail lets the reader know that what she is saying is with a probability bordering on certainty accurate and correct. Over the years she has churned out an imposing series of books covering a wide spectrum of the history of science in Britain during the Early Modern Period, each of them an impressive monument to her scholarship. Her latest addition to this series is a biography of Martin Folkes. I can already hear a significant number of readers of this blog muttering Martin who? Hence the title of this review. The fog lifts somewhat if one reads the full title of the volume, <em>Martin Folkes (1690–1754)</em>: <em>Newtonian, Antiquary, Connoisseur</em>.<a href="//7FA9106E-8BAC-435C-9AA9-0F338642996B#_ftn1"><sup><em><sup><strong>[1]</strong></sup></em></sup></a></p>

<p>Folkes is in fact a victim of a strange little hiccup in the popular history of science and also of the big names, big events approach to the discipline. The hiccup is the fact that the spotlight is shone very bright on the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the so-called scientific revolution, and on the nineteenth century, oft called the second scientific revolution, but the eighteenth century gets passed over with hardly a mention. Pass along folks nothing of interest to see here. This is, of course, not true a lot of important science was created in the eighteenth century, and this is one of the themes that Roos deals with, in her account of Folkes life, which encompassed the first half of the eighteenth century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the problem of the big names, big events approach to the history of science, Folkes falls through the net because there are no theories, major discoveries or inventions that can be attributed to him. However, science does not just progress through the big events in fact most scientific progress comes from those, who, so to speak, dot the ‘I’s and cross the ‘T’s. What Thomas Kuhn in one of his most useful contributions called ‘normal science’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martin Folkes was a mathematician, a Newtonian physicist, an antiquarian, a metrologist, a science administrator, an organiser, a science communicator, a science promotor, and a patron, and in all of these roles he made significant contributions to the progress of science not just in Britain but in the whole of Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century. Roos’ biography of this man with many hats brings all of these aspects of his personality and his activities vividly to light.</p>



<p>How did Martin Folkes become so significant and influential? One could say with more than somewhat justification that he was born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth. His family were wealthy, well connected, influential, landowning members of the London high society at the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries. He received an excellent private education receiving tuition in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and conversational French from the Huguenot refugee, James Cappel (1639–1722), and, perhaps more significantly, mathematics from another <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2018/10/24/a-newtonian-refuge/">Huguenot refugee Abraham De Moivre (1667–1754)</a>, who was one of the leading mathematicians of the age and a member of the Newtonian inner circle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Folkes’ contact with De Moivre serves as an early introduction to what was probably Folkes’ greatest strength, he was, in modern parlance, a master networker. This aspect of Folkes’ life and personality is described in great detail throughout Roos’ narrative. Through De Moivre Folkes came into contact with De Moirve’s other private students a significant cross-section of the early eighteenth century scientific and social elite. Through De Moivre he also gained access to Newton and the Newtonians, becoming a life-long highly active Newtonian himself.</p>



<p>Through Newton, Folkes was elected to the Royal Society, the start of a career that would see him become president of that august organisation, as well as president of the equally august Society of Antiquities; he was the only man ever to hold both presidencies. Here we meet another aspect of Folkes personality that certainly played an important role in his networking activities, he was immensely clubbable. For those, who don’t know this somewhat archaic, wonderful English word, it means somebody that others like to have as members of their social clubs and groupings. It seems that if someone set up a new club or society for the intellectual and/or social elite in the first half of the eighteenth century then Folkes was member, oft a founding member, organiser, and driving force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roos’ detailed description of the clubs, societies, and groups of which Folkes became an always-active member means that her biography is a historical guide to the social and cultural life of the social and intellectual upper echelons during Folkes lifetime. This not only includes the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquities, but also the then newly emerging English Freemasonry movement, in which Folkes played a leading role, the short lived but influential Egyptian Society, as well as various drinking and dinner clubs, in which members of the academic societies met more informally following sessions of those societies. Roos’ volume is also a guide to the eating and drinking habits of the well-heeled gentlemen of the period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although very much a member of the English establishment, Folkes was anything but a Little Englander. He maintained active contact with natural philosophers, mathematicians, and other propagators of the new sciences throughout Europe. He encouraged foreigners to come to Britain, also to buy British scientific instruments, and to publish the results of their researchers in British journals. He also patronised and supported foreign scholars he thought worthy of promotion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folkes extensive connections with the European mainland were also strengthened by his almost religious adherence to Newtonianism. Anybody who casts even a brief look at a modern English translation of Newton’s&nbsp;<em>Principia</em>&nbsp;quickly realises that it is not a work for the faint hearted or the ill prepared. The situation was not any different in the first half of the eighteenth century and Newton took no interest in popularising his work or making it available to the masses. Added to this was the fact that large parts of those in the know in Europe initially rejected much of Newton’s work on scientific and philosophical grounds, but also, with particular respect to his work in optics, because of their failure to reproduce many of his experiments. Various of Newton’s disciples jumped into the breach, left by the master’s silence, and presented popularisations of his major works, as books, lecture tours and demonstrations. Most notable, here, are another Huguenot refugee, John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683–1744) and the Dutchman, Willem ’s Gravesand (1688–1742).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folkes was also an eager missionary in the cause of Newtonianism. Folkes went on a grand tour of Europe between 1732 and 1735 preaching the gospel of Newton to learned societies and individual savants, in particular demonstrating those of Newton’s optical experiments that others had had difficulty replicating. During this tour Folkes made many friendships within the European intellectual milieu; friendships that he maintained through extensive correspondence when he returned to England.</p>

<p>One aspect of Roos’ biography that I found particularly interesting was her descriptions of Folkes’ activities as a metrologist. For those that don’t know this is not a typo for meteorologist, as my Word correction programme seemed to think, until I added metrologist to its dictionary. Metrology is the scientific study of measurement or as another dictionary defines it,&nbsp;the science&nbsp;of weights&nbsp;and measures; the study of units&nbsp;of measurements.&nbsp;Folkes interests was antiquarian, and he spent significant time and effort, on his grand tour, in trying to determine the correct length of a Roman foot. Why should I be interested in what seems, superficially at least, to be an arcane hobby on Folkes’ part?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality there was nothing arcane about Folkes’ interest in metrology. The turn to quantitative, empirical, experimental science and the resultant mathematisation that we call the scientific revolution led to a widespread discussion within the scientific community on systems and units of measurement towards unification, standardisation, and accuracy in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Historical investigations searching for supposed natural units of measurement were an integral part of that discussion. All of this peaked in the introduction of the metric system in France in 1799 and the Imperial system of measurement in the UK and British Empire in 1826. This important episode tends to get ignored in the mainstream history of science, so it was good that it gets handled here by Roos.</p>

<p>Oxford University Press have done Anna Marie Roos and Martin Folkes proud in the presentation of this biography. The front cover has a full colour portrait of the books subject and the book itself is extensively illustrated with grayscale and colour photos. The book is printed on bright white paper with an attractive typeface. Roos maintains her usual high scholarly standards, the book bursts at the seams with extensive, highly informative footnotes, which in turn reference a very extensive bibliography. All is rounded out by an equally extensive index.</p>



<p>All of the above is a mere sketch of all the context that Roos has packed into this model example of a biography of an eighteenth-century polymath, who definitely earns the attention that Roos has given to his life, work, and influence. This is an all-round, first-class piece of scholarship that not only introduces the reader to the little known but important figure of Martin Folkes, but because of the extensive contextual embedding provides a solid introduction to the social and cultural context in which science was practiced not only in England but throughout Europe in the first half of the eighteenth century. Highly recommended and not just for historians of science&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In terms of the books rediscovered from antiquity during the Renaissance one of those that had the biggest impact was Ptolemaeus’&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>, which became known in Latin as either the&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Cosmographia</em>. Claudius Ptolemaeus or (Klaúdios Ptolemaîos in Greek) is a scholar, who had a major impart on the development of the mathematical sciences in the second century CE and then again when his writings were rediscovered in the High Middle Ages during the twelfth century translation movement. He wrote important texts on astronomy, astrology, cosmology, harmony (music), and optics, amongst others. However, we know next to nothing about the man himself, neither his date of birth nor his date of death, nor very much else. He lived and worked in the city of Alexandria and people in the Middle Ages made the mistake of thinking he was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt from 323–30 BCE. There is a possibility that he acquired the name because he came from the town of Ptolemaîos Hermaiou&nbsp;in Upper Egypt.</p>



<p>Three of his books the&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>&nbsp;(better known in English as the&nbsp;<em>Almagest</em>) on astronomy, the&nbsp;<em>Tetrabiblos</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Apotelesmatiká</em>&nbsp;on astrology and the&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>&nbsp;on geography form a sort of trilogy. He says in the introduction of the&nbsp;<em>Tetrabiblos</em>&nbsp;that the study of the science of the stars is divided into two parts. The first, his&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>, describes where to find the celestial objects and the second, his&nbsp;<em>Tetrabiblos</em>, explains their influence. The&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>&nbsp;is in different ways directly related to both books. It is related to the&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>&nbsp;in that both works use a latitude/longitude coordinate system to map their respective realms, the sphere of the earth and the sphere of the heavens. This interconnectedness in reflected in the fact that in Early Modern Europe a cosmographer was somebody, who mapped both the celestial and terrestrial spheres. The&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>&nbsp;is in three parts, a theoretical introduction on mapping, a gazetteer of the coordinates of a long list of places and, geographical features, and a collection of maps. Like the&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>&nbsp;built on earlier works in the disciple, most notably that of Marinus of Tyre (c. 70–130 CE). To cast a horoscope in Greek astrology, one needs the coordinates of the place for which the horoscope in being cast, the&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>delivered those coordinates. In antiquity the last known reference to the&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>&nbsp;was in the work of Cassiodorus (c. 485–c. 585).&nbsp;</p>



<p>All three of these books by Ptolemaeus were translated into Arabic by the ninth century. Both the&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Tetrabiblos</em>&nbsp;had a major impact in Islamic culture, although both were criticised, changed, improved on in wide ranging commentaries by Islamic scholars. It was here that the&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>&nbsp;acquired the name&nbsp;<em>Almagest</em>meaning the greatest to distinguish it from a shorter, less important astronomical text from Ptolemaeus.&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>, however had very little impact on Islamic map making being used almost exclusively in an astrological context.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>&nbsp;was translated into Latin three times in the twelfth century. Twice from Arabic once by&nbsp;Abd al-Masīḥ of Winchester&nbsp;and once by Gerard of Cremona (1114–1187) and once directly from Greek in Sicily by an unknown translator. These translations establish Ptolemaic astronomy as the de facto medieval European astronomy. In the twelfth century the&nbsp;<em>Tetrabiblos&nbsp;</em>was also translated from Arabic into Latin by Plato of Trivoli in 1138 and directly from Greek into Latin by&nbsp;William of Moerbeke (c. 1220–c. 1286). Integrated into Christian theology by Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas it dominated European astrology right up to the end of the seventeenth century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Mathēmatikē Syntaxis</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Tetrabiblos</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em>&nbsp;was apparently not translated either from Arabic or Greek during the twelfth century. Giacomo or Jacopo d’Angelo of Scarperia better known in Latin as Jacobus Angelus obtained a Greek manuscript, found in Constantinople that he translated, into Latin in about 1406. </p>

<p>Here it obtained the title of&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Cosmographia</em>. There is some discussion or even doubt about how genuine the book is, as the oldest known Greek manuscript only dates back to the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Despite criticism of the quality of Jacobus Angelus’ translation it proved very popular, and the first printed edition appeared in Venice in 1475. However, it contained no maps. A second edition was printed in Rome in 1478, which contained maps printed from copper engravings. The engravings were begun by Konrad Sweynheym (who together with Arnold Pannartz set up the first printing press in Italy) and were completed by Arnold Buckinck after Sweynheym’s death in 1476. The first edition of&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;with maps printed using woodcuts was published in Ulm in 1482. Three major printed editions in les than a decade indicate the popularity of the book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quality, or rather supposed lack of it, of Jacobus Angelus’ translation led to a series of new translations from the Greek. The Nürnberger mathematicus Johannes Werner (1468–1522) </p>

<p>Pirckheimer’s edition formed the basis for the revised and edited edition published by the cosmographer, Sebastian Münster (1488–1552), in 1540 in Basel. Münster published an updated edition with extra illustrations in 1550. Münster’s&nbsp;<em>Geographia</em>&nbsp;was generally regarded as the standard Latin reference text of the work.</p>

<p>published his <em>Tratado da sphera com a Theorica do Sol e da Lua</em> in Lisbon in 1537. This was a based on a collection of texts and included the first, theoretical, section of Ptolemaeus’ <em>Geographia</em>. To make it more accessible Nunes published it in Latin, Spanish and Portuguese.</p>

<p>There were, naturally, also other vernacular translations of the work published in the sixteenth century, as for example this description of an Italian translation (borrowed from amateur astronomer and book collector, David Kolb, on Facebook):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Here is another one of the gems from my collection. I proudly present Claudius Ptolemy&#8217;s &#8220;La Geografia di Claudio Tolomeo Alessandrino&#8221; that was published in 1574. This volume is an expanded edition of his treatise on geography. Claudius Ptolemy lived in Alexandria during the 2nd century and is better known by astronomers for his astronomical treatise &#8220;The Almagest&#8221;. This is the third edition of the Italian translation by Girolamo Ruscelli, which was first printed by Vincenzo Valgrisi in Venice, in 1561. This edition is revised and corrected by Giovanni Malombra. The engraved maps, which are enlarged copies of Giacomo Gastaldi&#8217;s maps in his Italian edition of Venice, 1548, are generally the same in the Venice 1561, 1562 (Latin), and 1564 editions printed in Venice. Sixty-three of the maps are printed from the same plates as the 1561 edition. The exceptions are the Ptolemaic world map, &#8220;Tavola prima universale antica, di tutta la terra conosciura fin&#8217; a&#8217; tempi di Tolomeo,&#8221; which is on a revised conical projection, and the additional map &#8220;Territorio di Roma duodecima tavola nuova d&#8217;Europa&#8221; which is new to this edition. The atlas contains 27 Ptolemaic maps and 38 new maps.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first volume was intended to be his <em>Geographia</em>. In 1578 he published his <em>Tabulae geographicae Cl. Ptolemaei ad mentem auctoris restitutis ac emendatis.</em> (Geographic maps according to Claudius Ptolemy, drawn in the spirit of the author and expanded by Gerard Mercator). This was followed by a second edition in 1584 his <em>Geographiae Libri Octo</em>:<em> recogniti iam et diligenter emendati</em>, containing his revised version of Ptolemaeus’ text.</p>

<p> I hope I have made clear just how important the rediscovery of the <em>Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis</em> was in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries given the number of editions, of which I have only named a few, and the status of the authors, who produced those editions. In the next episode we will examine its impact on the map making in Europe during this period. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>From its very beginnings the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) was set up as a missionary movement carrying the Catholic Religion to all corners of the world. It also had a very strong educational emphasis in its missions, carrying the knowledge of Europe to foreign lands and cultures and at the same time transmitting the knowledge of those cultures back to Europe. Perhaps the most well-known example of this is the seventeenth-century Jesuit mission to China, which famously in the history of science brought the latest European science to that far away and, for Europeans, exotic land. In fact, the Jesuits used their extensive knowledge of the latest European developments in astronomy to gain access to the, for foreigners, closed Chinese culture.</p>



<p>It was, initially, <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2009/06/11/a-loser-who-was-really-a-winner/">Christoph Clavius (1538–1612), who by introducing his mathematics programme into the Jesuits more general education system</a>, ensured that the Jesuits were the best purveyors of mathematics in Europe in the early seventeenth century and it was <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/an-italo-chinese-jesuit/">Clavius’ student Matteo Ricci (1552–1610)</a>, who first breached the Chinese reserve towards strangers with his knowledge of the mathematical sciences.</p>



<p>The big question is what did the Chinese need the help of western astronomers for and why. Here we meet an interesting historical contradiction for the Jesuits. Unlike most people in the late sixteenth century and early seventeenth century, the Jesuits did not believe in or practice astrology. One should not forget that both Kepler and Galileo amongst many others were practicing astrologers. The Chinese were, however, very much practitioners of astrology at all levels and it was here that they found the assistance of the Jesuits desirable. The Chines calendar fulfilled important ritual and astrological functions, in particular the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses for which the emperor was personally responsible, and it had to be recalculated at the ascension to the throne of every new emperor. There was even an Imperial Astronomical Institute to carry out this task.</p>



<p>Although the Chinese had been practicing astronomy longer than the Europeans and, over the millennia, had developed a very sophisticated astronomy, in the centuries before the arrival of the Jesuits that knowledge had fallen somewhat into decay and had by that point not advanced as far as that of the Europeans. Before the arrival of the Jesuits, the Chinese had employed Muslim astronomers to aid them in this work, so the principle of employing foreigners for astronomical work had already been established. Through his work, Ricci had convinced the Chinese of his superior astronomical knowledge and abilities and thus established a bridgehead into the highest levels of Chinese society.</p>



<p>The man, who, for the Jesuits, made the greatest contribution to calendrical calculation in seventeenth century was the, splendidly named, Johann Adam Schall von Bell (1591–1666). Born, probably in Cologne, into a well-established aristocratic family, who trace their roots back to the twelfth century, Johann Adam was the second son of Heinrich Degenhard Schall von Bell zu Lüftelberg and his fourth wife Maria Scheiffart von Merode zu Weilerswist. He was initially educated at the Jesuit Tricoronatum Gymnasium in Cologne and then in 1607 sent to Rome to the Jesuit run seminary&nbsp;Pontificium Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum de Urbe, where he concentrated on the study of mathematics and astronomy. It is thought that his parents sent him to Rome to complete his studies because of an outbreak of the plague in Cologne. In 1611 he joined the Jesuits and moved to the Collegio Romano, where he became a student of <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/they-also-serve/">Christoph Grienberger</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He applied to take part in the Jesuit mission to China and in 1618 set sail for the East from Lisbon. He would almost certainly on his way to Lisbon have spent time at the Jesuit College in Coimbra, where the missionaries heading out to the Far East were prepared for their mission. Here he would probably have received instruction in the grinding of lenses and the construction of telescopes from&nbsp;Giovanni Paolo Lembo (c. 1570–1618), who taught these courses to future missionaries.</p>



<p>Schall von Bell set sail on 17 April 1618 in a group under the supervision of Dutch Jesuit Nicolas Trigault (1577–1628), Procurator of the Order’s Province of Japan and China. </p>

<p>Apart from Schall von Bell the group included the German, polymath Johannes Schreck (1576–1630), friend of Galileo and onetime member of the Accademia dei Lincei, and the Italian Giacomo Rho (1592–1638). They reached the Jesuit station in Goa 4 October 1618 and proceeded from there to Macau where they arrived on 22 July 1619. Here, the group were forced to wait four years, as the Jesuits had just been expelled from China. They spent to time leaning Chinese and literally fighting off an attempt by the Dutch to conquer Macau.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1623 Schall von Bell and the others finally reached Peking. In 1628 Johann Schreck began work on a calendar reform for the Chinese. To aid his efforts Johannes Kepler sent a copy of the Rudolphine Tables to Peking in 1627. From 1627 to 1630 Schall von Bell worked as a pastor but when Schreck died he and Giacomo Rho were called back to Peking to take up the work on the calendar and Schall von Bell began what would become his life’s work.</p>



<p>He must first translate Latin textbooks into Chinese, establish a school for astronomical calculations and modernise astronomical instruments.  In 1634 he constructed the first Galilean telescope in China, also writing a book in Chinese on the instrument. In 1635 he published his revised and modernised calendar, which still exists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scall von Bell used his influence to gain permission to build Catholic churches and establish Chinese Christian communities. This was actually the real aim of his work. He used his knowledge of mathematics and astronomy to win the trust of the Chinese authorities in order to be able to propagate his Christian mission.</p>



<p>In 1640 he produced a Chinese translation of <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2019/04/17/renaissance-heavy-metal/">Agricola’s <em>De re metallica</em>,</a> which he presented to the Imperial Court. He followed this on a practical level by supervising the manufacture of a hundred cannons for the emperor. In 1644, the emperor appointed him President of the Imperial Astronomical Institute following a series of accurate astronomical prognostication. From 1651 to 1661 he was a personal advisor to the young Manchurian Emperor Shunzhi (1638–1661), who promoted Schall von Bell to Mandarin 1<sup>st</sup> class and 1<sup>st</sup> grade, the highest level of civil servant in the Chinese system.</p>

<p>Following the death of Shunzhi, he initially retained his appointments and titles, which caused problems for him in Rome following a visitation in Peking by the Dominicans. The Vatican ruled that Jesuits should not take on mundane appointments. In 1664 Schall von Bell suffered a stroke, which left him vulnerable to attack from his rivals at court. He was accused of having provoked Shunzhi’s  concubine&#8217;s death through having falsely calculated the place and time for the funeral of one of Shunzhi’s sons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The charges, that included other Jesuits, were high treason, membership of a religious order not compatible with right order and the spread of false astronomical teachings. Schall von Bell was imprisoned over the winter 1665/66 and Jesuits in Peking, who had not been charged were banned to Kanton. He was found guilty on 15 April 1665 and sentenced to be executed by Lingchi, death by a thousand cuts. However, according to legend, there was an earthquake shortly before the execution date and the judge interpreted it as a sign from the gods the Schall von Bell was innocent. On 15 May 1665 Schall von Bell was released from prison on the order of the Emperor Kangxi (1654–1722). He died 15 August 1666 and was rehabilitated by Kangxi, who ensured that he received a prominent gravestone that still exists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Schall von Bell was represented at his trial by Flemish Jesuit Ferdinand Verbiest (1623–1688), who would later take up Schall von Bell’s work on the Chinese calendar but that’s a story for another day. Schall von Bell reached the highest ever level for a foreigner in the Chinese system of government but in the history of science it is his contributions to the modernisation of Chinese astronomy and engineering that are most important.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some time back I had a late-night chat with medieval historian Tim O’Neill about all things Galileo Galilei; late night for me that is, early morning for him. Unbeknown to me the sneaky Aussie bugger recorded my ruminations on the Tuscan mathematicus; they’re like that those antipodeans, duplicitous. Now he’s gone and posted the whole affair on YouTube, for all the world to see.</p>

<p>An article in the Sunday Express, not a newspaper I would normally read in fact I would only ever use it as toilet paper in an emergency, starts thus:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Former Supreme Court Judge Lord Sumption has condemned attacks on scientists who challenge “official wisdom” on Covid, comparing their critics to the “persecutors of Galileo”.</p></blockquote>



<p>A classic case of the Galileo fallacy or Galileo gambit. For anybody not aware of the Galileo fallacy:</p>

<p>Lucy Johnston, Health and social Affairs Editor of the Sunday Express tweeted this article with the following lede:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Lord Sumption: “Scientists behaving like the persecutors of Galileo&#8230;.forgetting all scientific conclusions are provisional, including their own.</p></blockquote>



<p>Lucy Johnston’s lede is in fact disingenuous, as she combines two half sentences that are in no way connected in the article, but we will examine it as if they were. Galileo’s persecutors were very well aware that scientific conclusions are provisional as stated very clearly by Roberto Bellarmino in his Foscarini Letter, I quote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Third, I say that if there were a true demonstration that the sun is at the centre of the world and the earth in the third heaven, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary; and say rather that we do not understand them than that what is demonstrated is false. But I will not believe that there is such a demonstration, until it is shown me.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>During the seventeenth century many Catholic astronomers and natural philosophers were involved in providing the necessary evidence to support a heliocentric world view. Many of them were Jesuits or Jesuit educated. They would not have done so if they did not believe that scientific conclusions are provisional.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why I tweeted:</p>



<p><em>Sorry to introduce some real history into this thread but that is not what Galileo&#8217;s prosecutors did.</em></p>



<p>To which Helen O’Toole an Irish Early Years Educator (her description) replied with the following <a href="https://www.history.com/.amp/this-day-in-history/galileo-is-accused-of-heresy">link:</a></p>



<p>One should note that the website, which is the website of the History television channel describes itself as “History #1&nbsp;<strong>Factual</strong>&nbsp;Entertainment Brand” [my emphasis] History the television channel is notorious for it’s pseudo-documentaries of bullshit woo and the inaccuracies of its historical documentaries.</p>



<p>Here we can read the following:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>1633 April 12 Galileo is accused of heresy</p></blockquote>



<p>This is in fact false. Galileo was not accused of heresy but of having breached the Church injunction, issued to him personally in 1616, not to hold or teach the heliocentric theory. Before somebody charges in saying, “they had no right to issue such an injunction”, I will point out, for the umpteenth time, that at the beginning of the seventeenth century the Catholic Church was an absolutist political and legal authority and had every right under the prevailing system to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also important to note, again for the umpteenth time, that when Galileo got himself into trouble with the Catholic authorities, the scientific situation was such that the available empirical evidence supported a geocentric or helio-geocentric system and not a heliocentric one, as there was absolutely no evidence that the Earth moved. Also, and this is very important, Galileo or anybody else, for that matter, was free to discuss a heliocentric system hypothetically but not to claim that it was factually true.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>On April 12, 1633, chief inquisitor Father&nbsp;Vincenzo Maculani da Firenzuola, appointed by Pope Urban VIII, begins the inquisition of physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei. Galileo was ordered to turn himself in to the Holy Office to begin trial for holding the belief that the Earth revolves around the sun, which was deemed heretical by the Catholic Church. Standard practice demanded that the accused be imprisoned and secluded during the trial.</p></blockquote>



<p>Galileo was ordered to turn himself in for holding and teaching the heliocentric hypothesis as proven fact. The heliocentric theory was never formally declared heretical by the Catholic Church. The eleven&nbsp;Qualifiers, appointed by the Church to examine the heliocentric theory, came to the conclusion that the idea that the Sun is stationary is “foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture…” However, only the Pope can formally declare something heretical and in the case of the heliocentric theory no pope ever took this step.</p>



<p>This is followed by a wonderful case of false information by implication. “Standard practice demanded that the accused be imprisoned and secluded during the trial.” In Galileo’s case, due to his advanced age and his social status, on the one hand he was the most famous natural philosopher and astronomer in Europe and on the other he was a Medici courtier, Galileo was given his own three-room apartment, with servants, in the palace of the Inquisition. This is a somewhat different picture to the usual one, implied here, of Galileo being thrown into prison, or even a dungeon. Galileo even wrote a letter to his daughter saying how well he was being treated.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This was the second time that Galileo was in the hot seat for refusing to accept Church orthodoxy that the Earth was the immovable center of the universe: In 1616, he had been forbidden from holding or defending his beliefs. In the 1633 interrogation, Galileo denied that he “held” belief in the Copernican view but continued to write about the issue and evidence as a means of “discussion” rather than belief. The Church had decided the idea that the sun moved around the Earth was an absolute fact of scripture that could not be disputed, despite the fact that scientists had known for centuries that the Earth was not the center of the universe.</p></blockquote>



<p>I do wish people wouldn’t in this context use the word belief. Galileo held it for a fact that the cosmos, as it was then known, was heliocentric and was convinced that he could prove it. The Church had not decided that “the idea that the sun moved around the Earth was an absolute fact of scripture that could not be disputed”. The Church said that scripture stated that the Sun revolves around the Earth and the best available empirical evidence at the beginning of the seventeenth century supported that hypothesis. The Church was quite happy to change that view if new evidence to support the heliocentric hypothesis should be found, which it did in the eighteenth century, when that evidence, stellar aberration, was in fact found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, all the above I have gone through in various posts in the past, what drove me to write this new post was the last statement, “<strong>despite the fact that scientists had known for centuries that the Earth was not the center of the universe.”&nbsp;</strong>[my emphasis], I mean WHAT THE FUCK! It’s truly time for a bit of the HIST_SCI HULK</p>



<p>Can somebody please enlighten me, as to who these scientists were, who had known for centuries that the Earth was not the centre of the universe?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember this was posted on “History #1 <strong>Factual</strong> Entertainment Brand” [my emphasis], so let us re-examine the actual historical facts. Copernicus published his <em>De revolutionibus</em>, containing his heliocentric hypothesis, in 1543, that’s ninety years before Galileo’s trial, not centuries. Copernicus had deferred the publication for a couple of decades because he couldn’t provide any empirical evidence to support his hypothesis. When he finally published his hypothesis was mathematically plausible but still lacked any empirical evidence. Over the next ninety years despite efforts by numerous astronomers at prove or refute Copernicus’ hypothesis nobody had found any empirical evidence to show that the Earth moved. The best evidence for a heliocentric system was Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2018/05/15/400-years-of-the-third-law-an-overlooked-and-neglected-revolution-in-astronomy/">in particular his third law</a>, which interestingly Galileo simply ignored. The other available evidence was the various observations, <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/the-emergence-of-modern-astronomy-a-complex-mosaic-part-xxv/">made by various astronomers, confirming the solar orbits of comets</a>, which Galileo didn’t just ignore but actively rejected. Just for the record, in 1633, the available empirical evidence supported either a geocentric system or more likely a Tychonic helio-geocentric system with the Earth still firmly at the centre.</p>



<p>I find it simply depressing that an organisation with the worldwide reach of the History Channel (which actually just calls itself History these days) is propagating such inaccurate crap as factual history, which is being consumed and believed by such people as Helen O’Toole an Irish Early Years Educator, who drew my attention to this travesty.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vitruvius’&nbsp;<em>De architectura</em>&nbsp;was by no means the only book rediscovered from antiquity that dealt with the construction and use of machines and the Renaissance artist-engineers were also not the only authors producing new texts on machines. In this episode of our series, we are going to look at another stream of writings that led to some of the most impressive publications on machines ever produced.</p>



<p>Ancient books, in Europe, on machines do not begin with Vitruvius, who actually comes quite late in the development of this type of literature. There are several known authors from ancient Greece, whose works did not survive but who are mentioned and even quoted by later authors such as Vitruvius and Pliny. Polyidus of Thessaly, who is mentioned by Vitruvius, served under Philip II of Macedonia in the fourth century BCE. He is credited with the development of covered battering rams and a giant siege tower (helepolis) by Byzantium in 340 BCE.  His students Diades of Pella and Charias, both also mentioned by Vitruvius, served under Philip’s son Alexander the Great. </p>



<p>In Alexandria the earliest known author was Ctesibius, who invented a wide range of machines, which he described in his&nbsp;<em>Commentaries</em>, now lost but known to both Vitruvius and Hero of Alexandria. Much better know is a contemporary of Ctesibius, Philo of Byzantium (c. 280–c. 220 BCE), also known as Philo Mechanicus, who lived and worked in Alexandria. He wrote a major work in nine books covering mathematics, general mechanics, harbour building, artillery, pneumatic machines, mechanical toys, siege engines, siege craft, and cryptography. His work on artillery and siege craft survived in Greek as did fragments of his books on mathematics and mechanical toys but were first translated in the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. Parts of his book on pneumatics, however, survived in a Latin translation,&nbsp;<em>De ingeniis</em>&nbsp;<em>spiritualibus</em>, from an Arabic manuscript. It can however be assumed that his works were well known to and influenced other authors later in antiquity.</p>



<p>We have already met Vitruvius the most well-known author on things mechanical during the Roman Empire and had a brief reference to Athenaeus Mechanicus (fl. mid first century BCE). Athenaeus, a Greek living in Rome, wrote a book on siege craft titled&nbsp;<em>On Machines</em>, which cites both Diades of Pella and Philo of Byzantium, as sources. Much of his book parallels that of Vitruvius implying the use of common sources.</p>



<p>In the middle of the first century CE, we meet Hero of Alexandria, whose exact dates are unknown, perhaps the most well-known Greek engineer of Antiquity, who exercised a similar influence in the Renaissance to Vitruvius. Works that are attributed with certainty are <em>Pneumatica</em> (on pneumatics), <em>Automata</em>, <em>Mechanica</em> (written for architects and only preserved in Arabic), <em>Metrica </em>(measuring areas and volumes), <em>On the Dioptra</em>, <em>Belopoeica </em>(war machines), and <em>Catoptrica</em> (the science of reflected lights). His <em>Belopoeica </em>is attributed to Ctesibius. The <em>Metrica</em> first reappeared in the nineteenth century and the <em>Mechanica</em> was unknown in Europe. However, the <em>Pneumatica</em>, the <em>Automata</em>, and the <em>Belopoeica</em> were translated from Greek into Latin and printed and published in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Hero was the last of the technical authors of antiquity but the later authors such as Pliny the Elder (23/24–79 CE) or Pappus of Alexander (c. 290–c. 350 CE) reference authors such as Vitruvius and Hero.</p>



<p>Before moving forward to the Renaissance, we need to take a brief look at the developments in the Islamic Empire. In the ninth century the translators the Bana Musa, three Persian brother,&nbsp;Ahmad, Muhammad, and Hasan bin Musa ibn Shakir, published a large, illustrated work on machines the&nbsp;<em>Book of Ingenious Devices</em>&nbsp;in 850 CE. It drew on the work of Hero of Alexandria and Philo of Byzantium as well Persian, Chinese, and Indian engineering. It was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the thirteenth century. </p>

<p>In the twelfth century&nbsp;Badīʿ az-Zaman Abu l-ʿIzz ibn Ismāʿīl ibn ar-Razāz al-Jazarī&nbsp;(1136–1206) wrote his&nbsp;<em>The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices</em>. Truly spectacular,&nbsp;it contains descriptions of fifty complex machines and was the most advanced such book produced up till this time, but it was never translated into Latin and so had no influence in the Renaissance.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that in antiquity texts on machines had an emphasis on war machines. During the fifteenth century the first texts on machines were also on war machines and were written by physicians and not artisans. Konrad Kyeser (1366–1405) wrote a book on military engineering,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0009/bsb00090291/images/">Belliforti</a>s</em>, dedicated to the Holy Roman Emperor Ruprecht III, who ruled from 1400–1410. </p>

<p>In Germany in the fifteenth century there were several books on military engineering written in the vernacular as well as a German translation of Kyeser’s&nbsp;<em>Bellifortis</em>. The author of the&nbsp;<em>Feuerwerksbuch</em>&nbsp;from 1420 is not known. <a href="https://wordpress.com/post/thonyc.wordpress.com/7431">Martin Mercz (c. 1425–1501), a gunner, also wrote a&nbsp;<em>Feuerwerksbuch</em>&nbsp;around 1473</a>. Philipp Mönch wrote a&nbsp;<em>Kriegsbuch</em>&nbsp;in 1496</p>



<p>The texts produced by the Renaissance artist-engineers that we looked at in the last episode, whilst distributed in manuscript, were never issued as printed books, as was the case with most of the fifteenth century books of military engineering. The introduction of printing to the genre of machine texts had a major impact. One book on military engineering that was printed and published was the&nbsp;<em>Elenchus et index rerum militarium</em>&nbsp;by the humanist scholar Roberto Valturio (1405–1475), a compendium of ancient authorities with an emphasis on the technological aspects of warfare.</p>

<p> It was written for and dedicated to Sigismund Malatesta of Rimini (1471-1468), a successful military leader but also a humanist poet, originally between 1455 and 1460 and distributed widely in manuscript but was published in Verona in 1472. It went through many printed editions and translations. Leonardo da Vinci was known to have owned a copy.</p>

<p>Both books deal with mining, the extraction of metallic ores and the working of metal smelted from the ores. Both are lavishly illustrated with the drawings in Agricola’s book being of a much higher standard than those in Biringuccio’s book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have dealt with both books and their authors in earlier posts (see links above) and so won’t go into great detail here but in these two books with have an excellent example of the crossover between the world of the university educated theoretician and the artisan on artisanal topics. Agricola is a university educated physician writing theoretically about a group of related artisanal topics, whereas Biringuccio is an experienced artisan writing a theoretical book about his artisanal trades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The late sixteenth century saw the birth of a new book genre, the machine book. These were books of diagrams of machines with brief descriptions, usual presented by the author to a powerful patron. The main ones were very popular and went through several editions or reprints. These books often contained not only machines designed by the authors, but their presentations of machines drawn from other sources. Many of these studies were almost certainly not intended as serious designs to be built but were rather ingenious studies designed to impress rich patrons, in the nature of the futuristic design studies that car companies present at car shows. This also, almost certainly, applies to many of the designs to be found in the manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci.</p>



<p>The earliest of the machine books by the French Protestant, inventor and mathematician, Jacques Besson (1540? – 1573). He said that he was born in Colombières near Briançon in the Alps on the south-eastern border of France, now in Italy. In the 1550s he taught mathematics in Paris and was working as a hydraulic engineer in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1559 he published a book in Zurich and in 1561 he was awarded citizenship in Geneva as a science and mathematics teacher. In 1562 he was a pastor in Villeneuve-de-Berg in France but 1565 finds him back in Paris where he published his&nbsp;<em>La Cosmolabe</em>, a multiple instrument based on the astrolabe designed for use in navigation, surveying, cartography, and astronomy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1569 in Orléans he presented a draft of his new volume&nbsp;<em>Theatrum Instrumentorum&nbsp;</em>(giving the machine book genre the alternative name of Theatre of Machines) to Charles IX, as a result returning to Paris as Master of the Kings Machines. The&nbsp;<em>Theatrum Instrumentorum</em>, containing sixty plates, was printed and published in 1571-2.</p>

<p>In Besson case his book only contains machines that he claimed to have invented himself. Following the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 1572 Besson fled to London where he died in the following year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1572, our next machine book author, Agostino Ramelli (1531–c. 1610) a Catholic military engineer, was involved in the siege of the Protestant stronghold, La Rochelle.</p>

<p> Very little is known about Ramelli other than that he was born in Ponte Tresa on Lake Lugano on the border between Switzerland and the Duchy of Milan. He seems to have served most of his early life as a military engineer and comes to prominence at La Rochelle, because he was wounded and taken prisoner. Henry, Duke of Anjou, arranged his release and when Henry became King of France in 1575, he apparently appointed Ramelli royal engineer, as he styled himself in the preface to his book, engineer of the most Christian King of France.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1588 he self-published his&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbc0001.2008rosen1313/">Diverse Et Artificiose Machine,&nbsp;</a></em>the book, the largest of the genre, contains one hundred and ninety-five plates, printed from high quality engraved copper plates.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the machines are hydraulic engines. Unlike Bresson, who included no war machines in his book, about one third of Ramelli’s book consists of war machines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ramelli is certainly today the most well known of the machine book authors because his book-wheel has become an iconic image on social media. Due to the lavish quality of the illustrations Ramelli’s book became an instant coffee table book, which was probably his intention, and is still in print today.</p>

<p>We know very little about Bresson and even less about Ramelli, but in the case of the third author of a major machine book, Vittorio Zonca (1568–1603), we know next to nothing. His book,&nbsp;<a href="http://gutenberg.beic.it/view/action/nmets.do?DOCCHOICE=2059080.xml&amp;dvs=1627396011781~831&amp;locale=en_GB&amp;search_terms=&amp;show_metadata=true&amp;adjacency=&amp;VIEWER_URL=/view/action/nmets.do?&amp;DELIVERY_RULE_ID=7&amp;divType="><em>Novo Teatro di Machine et Edificii</em>,</a> was published posthumously by Francesco Bertelli in Padua in 1607. Bertelli appears not to have known Zonca but describes him as a Paduan architect. Like the books of Bresson and Ramelli. Zonca’s volume went through several edition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The German architect and engineer, Heinrich Zeising (died 1610 or earlier) compiled the first German machine book borrowing heavily from the works of Walther Hermann Ryff’s German edition of Vitruvius, Besson, Ramelli, Zonca, Gerolamo Cardano, and others This was published as <a href="http://www.theatra.de/repertorium/ed000034.pdf"><em>Theatrum Machinarum</em> </a>in six parts by Henning Grosse in Leipzig between 1607 and 1614. In the foreword to the second part in 1610, Grosse informed the reader that Zeising was deceased .</p>

<p>The Bishop of Czanad in Hungary, Fautus Verantius (c. 1551–1617), in his retirement, published a multilingual machine book,&nbsp;<em>Machinae Novae</em>, in 1616. It had 49 plates containing 55 machines, described in Latin and Italian in one variant and in Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, and German in another. There exists the possibility that Verantius saw and was influenced by Leonardo’s manuscripts.</p>

<p>The Italian engineer and architect, Giovanni Branca (1571–1645) dedicated a collection of illustrations of mechanical inventions to the governor of Loreto Ancona, which he then published as a book&nbsp;<em>Le machine</em>&nbsp;in 1629. The book contains 63 illustrations with descriptions in Latin and Italian, but whereas the books of Bresson and Ramelli are large format volumes with lavish copper plate engravings, Branca’s book is a small octavo volume illustrated with simple woodcuts.</p>

<p>In the relatively brief period covering the last quarter of the sixteenth century and the first quarter of the seventeenth century, the Renaissance Theatre of Machines books, as they became known after the first one from Jacques Besson, were very popular. Although they continued to be reprinted throughout the seventeenth century their time was over and literature over technology moved on into different formats. This is one of the signs that Renaissance science did indeed peter out in the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I appear to have become something of a fan of the Cambridge University historian of science, Patricia Fara. The first book of hers that I read, and that some years ago, was&nbsp;<em>Newton: The Making of a Genius</em>&nbsp;(Columbia University Press, 2002), an excellent deconstruction of the myths that grew up around England’s most lauded natural philosopher during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. I do not own this volume, but I do own her&nbsp;<em>Pandora’s Breeches: Women, Science and Power in the Enlightenment&nbsp;</em>(Pimlico, 2004), which delivers what the title promises. A detailed look at women, who contributed to enlightenment science and, who usually get ignored in mainstream history of science. I also own her&nbsp;<em>An Entertainment for Angels: Electricity in the Enlightenment</em>&nbsp;(Icon Books: 2002), a delightful romp through the first century of the scientific investigation of phenomenon of electricity. Also on my bookshelf is her&nbsp;<em>Science</em>:&nbsp;<em>A Four Thousand Year History</em>&nbsp;(OUP, 2009), a fresh and provocative one volume overview of the history of science. To round out my Fara collection I also have her&nbsp;<em>Sex, Botany &amp; Empire</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Story of Carl Linnaeus and Joseph Banks</em>&nbsp;(Icon Books, 2003) on my to-read-pile; I mean who could resist a title like that from an author with a proven track record for excellent history of science narratives.</p>



<p>Patricia Fara’s latest publication returns to the subject of England’s most iconic natural philosopher, Isaac Newton, but deals not with his science but the last thirty years of his life after he had effectively abandoned the production of new science and mathematics for the life of a gentleman about town,&nbsp;<em>Life after Gravity</em>:&nbsp;<em>Isaac Newton’s London Career<a href="//D10A612F-7420-4836-8393-91AA17170761#_ftn1"><sup><strong>[1]</strong></sup></a></em>. </p>

<p>Before I go into detail, this book maintains the high standards of historical research and literary excellence that Fara has consistently displayed over her previous publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anybody, who is reasonably acquainted with Newton’s biography will already know that he turned his back on Cambridge and academia in 1696, to move to London to become first Warden and then in 1699 Master of the Royal Mint. This move enabled him to become President of the Royal Society in 1704, an integral part of the socio-political power structure in the capitol during the next thirty years, and also to become immensely wealthy. It is to this part of Newton’s life that Fara turns her sharp and perceptive eye and which she analyses with her acerbic, historical scalpel.</p>



<p>I have over the decades read a lot of Newton biographies, as well as papers and books that deal with specific aspects of his life and work, including aspects of the last thirty years of his life that he spent living in London, such as Tom Levenson’s excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/11/11/you-can-con-all-of-the-people-some-of-the-time-and-some-of-the-people-all-of-the-time-but-you-cant-con-all-of-the-people-all-of-the-time-however-you-can-con-enough-people-long-enough-to-c/"><em>Money for Nothing</em>:&nbsp;<em>The South Sea Bubble and the Invention of Modern Capitalism</em>. </a>Despite this, I learnt a lot of new things from Fara’s excellent small volume.</p>



<p>Fara’s book is actually two interlinked narratives; the contextual biography of Newton’s years in London is interwoven with an analysis of William Hogarth’s 1732 painting,&nbsp;<em>The Indian Emperor. Or the Conquest of Mexico. As performed in the year 1731 in Mr Conduitt’s, Master of the Mint, before the Duke of Cumberland etc. Act 4, Scene 4</em>.</p>

<p>This painting by Hogarth shows a performance of a heroic drama, written by John Dryden (1631–1700) and first performed in 1665, being performed by a group of children in the drawing room of the town house of John Conduitt (1688–1737), the husband of Newton’s niece and one time housekeeper, Catherine Barton; Conduitt was also Newton’s successor as Master of the Mint. This picture depicts several of the main characters of the book’s biographical narrative, including Newton as a bust mounted on the wall. It also reflects some of the main themes of the books such as imperialism. The interweaving of the descriptions of the painting and the various episodes of Newton’s life in London is a very powerful literary device and is representative for the fact that Fara’s book is deeply contextual and not just a simple listing of Newton’s activities during those last thirty years of his life.</p>



<p>The book is divided into three sections, the first of which deals mainly with Newton’s various residences in London and his general domestic life, within the context of early eighteenth-century London. The second section turns the reader’s attention to Newton’s reign at the Royal Society and the reign of the first Hanoverian King, George I, and his family and court with whom Newton was intimately involved. The final section takes the reader to the Royal Mint and also turns the spotlight on English imperialism.</p>



<p>I’m not going to go into much detail, for that you’ll have to read the book and I heartily recommend that you do so, but I want to draw attention to two prominent aspects of the book that I found particularly good.</p>



<p>The first is, surprising perhaps in a Newton biography, a good dose of feminist historiography. As one would expect from the author of&nbsp;<em>Pandora’s Breeches</em>&nbsp;and more recently&nbsp;<em>A LAB of ONE’S OWN</em>:&nbsp;<em>Science and Suffrage in the First World War</em>(OUP, 2018)–I love the indirect Virginia Woolf reference–Fara pays detailed attention to the women in her narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her description of life in the Tower of London, where the Mint was situated and where Newton initially lived when he moved to London, she introduces the reader to Elizabeth Tollet (1694-1754). Tollet, a poet and translator, was the handicapped daughter of George Tollet a Royal Navy, who lived with her father in the Tower. Unusually for the time, she was highly educated, Fara uses her diaries to describe life in the Tower and also features some of her poems that dealt with Newtonian natural philosophical themes and her elegy,&nbsp;<em>On the Death of Sir Isaac Newton</em>&nbsp;(1727).</p>



<p>Fara also paints a very sympathetic portrait of Queen Anne (1665–1714), who ruled over Britain for slightly more that the first decade of the eighteenth century. She has often been much maligned by her biographers and Fara presents her in a more favourable light. Newton niece and sometime housekeeper, Catherine Barton (1679–1739), naturally, features large and in this context Fara discusses an interesting aspect of male chauvinism from the period, of which I was previously unaware. The habit of older gentlemen having sexual relations with much younger, often closely related, women sometimes within a marital relationship, sometimes not. She details the case of Robert Hooke (1635–1703), who slept with his niece Grace. She speculates, whether Voltaire’s claim that Newton got his job at the Mint, because Charles Montagu (1661–1715) had slept with Catherine Barton is true or not. If he had, she would have been a teenager at the time.</p>



<p>The section on the Hanoverian court concentrates on Caroline of Ansbach (1683–1737), George I daughter-in-law, a fascinating woman, who enjoyed intellectual relations with both Leibniz and Newton. Effectively abandoning the former for the latter, when she moved, with the court, from Hanover to London. Fara’s book is worth the purchase price alone, for her presentation of the women surrounding Newton during his London residency.</p>



<p>The second aspect of the book that I would like to emphasise is Fara’s treatment of British imperialism and the associated exploitation and racism during the first third of the eighteenth century. Recently, there have been major debates about various aspects of these themes. In the general actually debate on racism, historians have pointed out that the modern concept of racism is a product of the eighteenth century. Others have opposed this saying that one should instead emphasise the eighteenth century as the century of the Enlightenment, quoting Newtonian physics and astronomy as one of its great contributions, apparent unsullied by associations with Empire and slavery. Coming from a different direction the debate on the restoration of art works stolen by the colonial powers, Britain leading the pack, has cast another strong spotlight on this period and its evils.</p>



<p>Fara tackles the themes head on. She goes into detail about how the gold that Newton minted in large quantities, the major source of his own private wealth, came from British exploitation of Africa. She also goes into quite a lot of detail concerning the joint stock companies, set up to further Britain’s imperial aims, to establish and exploit its colonies and their active involvement in the slave trade. As well as profiting from the African gold that he minted for the British government, Newton also profited from his extensive investments in the East India Company and initially from his investments in the South Sea Company, both of which were involved in the slave trade. He, of course, famously also lost heavily in the collapse of the South Sea Company’s share price. Fara successfully removes the clean white vest that many attempt to award Newton in this context.</p>



<p>Fara’s book is much more that a portrait of Newton’s final three decades, it is also a wide ranging and illuminating portrait of London in the first third of the eighteenth century, its social life, its economics, its politics, and its imperialism. This is not just the London of Newton, but also of Swift, Defoe, Pope, and many others. Everything is carefully and accurately researched and presented for the reader in an attractive, easy to read, narrative form. The book has endnotes, which are just references to the very extensive bibliography. There is also as very good index.</p>



<p>The book is illustrated with a block of colour illustration, which are repeated in black and white at the relevant points in the text, and here I must make my only negative comment on Fara’s otherwise excellent book. The quality of the reproduction of colour prints is at best mediocre and, in my copy at least the black and white prints are so dark as to render them next to useless. Something went wrong somewhere.</p>



<p>As should be clear, if you have read your way through all of this review,&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is an excellent book and I can’t recommend it enough. If I had a five-star system of valuation, I would be tempted to give Fara’s volume six, with perhaps half a star taken off for the poor quality of the illustrations, for which, of course, the author is not responsible. In my opinion it is a must read for anybody interested in Newton and his life but also for those more generally interested in the Augustan Age. If you one of those general interested in reading, well written, accessible, entertaining, and informative history books then you can add Fara’s tome to your reading list without reservations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/07/01/renaissance-science-xiii/">the previous episode</a> we saw how the Renaissance rediscovery of Vitruvius’&nbsp;<em>De architectura</em>&nbsp;influenced the development of architecture during the Renaissance and dissolved the boundary between the intellectual theoreticians and the practical artisans. However, as stated there Vitruvius was not just an architect, but was also an engineer and his Book X deals quite extensively with machines both civil and military. This had a massive influence on a new type of artisan the Renaissance artist-engineer and it is to these that we now turn our attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Artist-engineers were very much a Northern Italian Renaissance phenomenon, but even earlier artists had been categorised as craftsmen or artisans and not as artists as we would understand the term. The occupation of artist-engineer was very much influenced by the popularity of Vitruvius’&nbsp;<em>De architectura</em>. The most well-known Renaissance artist engineer is, of course, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), but he was by no means unique, as he is often presented in popular accounts, but he stood at the end of a line of other artist-engineers, who are known to have influenced him. Here I will deal principally with those artisan artist-engineers, who dissolved the boundary between practice and theory by witing and circulating treatises on their work.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the line were the Florentine rival, goldsmiths Lorenzo Ghiberti (1378–1455) and Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446). In 1401 there was a competition to design the first set of new doors for the Florence Baptistery. Ghiberti and Brunelleschi were two of the seven artists on the short list. Ghiberti won the commission and set up a major engineering workshop to carry out the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took Ghiberti twenty-one years to complete the first set of doors featuring twenty New Testament Bible scenes, the four evangelists and four of the Church Fathers, but once finished they established his reputation, as a great Renaissance artist. In 1425 he was awarded a second commission for another set of doors, these featuring ten Old Testament scenes in realistic perspective presentation took another twenty-seven years. The second set of doors included portraits of both Ghiberti and his father Bartolomeo Ghiberti.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We don’t need to go into any great detail here about the doors or the other commissions that Ghiberti’s workshop finished. </p>

<p>What is much more relevant to our theme is his activities as an author. Although he was the artisan son of an artisan father, Ghiberti crossed the medieval boundary between theory and practice with his&nbsp;<em>Commentarii</em>, a thesis on the history of art, written in Italian. He drew on various sources from antiquity including the first century BCE illustrated Greek text on machines by Athenaeus Mechanicus and Pliny’s&nbsp;<em>Naturalis Historia</em>, a text much discussed by the Renaissance Humanists, but his major source was Vitruvius’&nbsp;<em>De architectura</em>. Ghiberti died without finishing his&nbsp;<em>Commentarii&nbsp;</em>and it was never published. However, many important Renaissance artist, such as Donatello and Paolo Uccello, served their apprenticeships in his workshop, so his influence on future generations was very large.</p>



<p>One probable graduate of Ghiberti’s workshop was Antonio Averlino (c. 1400–c. 1469) known as Filarete, a sculptor and architect.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Between 1461 and 1464, he wrote a vernacular volume on architecture in twenty-five books, his illustrated <em>Trattato di Architettura</em>, which circulated widely in manuscript. Central to his theory of architecture was the Vitruvian ideal of practice combined with theory. The most significant part of his book was his design for Sforzinda an ideal city named after his patron Francesco Sforza (1401–1466). This was the first of several ideal cities, which became a feature of the Renaissance. It is thought that his inspiration came from the works of Plato and his knowledge of this came from his friend at the Sforza court, the humanist scholar and philologist Francesco da Tolentino (1398–1481) known as Filelfo. Once again, we have, as in the last episode, a cooperation across the old boundaries between a scholar and an artisan.</p>

<p>Filippo Brunelleschi poses a different problem. Like Ghiberti trained as a goldsmith, he went on to become the epitome of a Renaissance Vitruvian architect. However, there is no direct evidence that connects him with&nbsp;<em>De architectura</em>&nbsp;or its author. There is no direct evidence that connects him with anything except for the products of his life’s work, most notably the dome of the Santa Maria del Fiori cathedral in Florence. He is also renowned as the inventor or discoverer of the mathematical principles of linear perspective, as explained in episode seven of this series. This links him indirectly to Vitruvius, as some authors insist that he only rediscovered linear perspective, quoting Book 7 of De architectura, where Vitruvius describes the use of some form of perspective on the ancient Greek theatre flats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More importantly, Brunelleschi, as an architect, not only designed and supervised the construction of the buildings that he was commissioned to build but also devised and constructed the machines that he needed on his building sites to facilitate those constructions. For his work on the Santa Maria dome, for example he designed a crane to lift the building materials up to the top of the cathedral. </p>

<p>A drawing of that crane can be found in Leonardo’s manuscripts. He was also granted a patent by the ruling council of Florence for the design of a ship to transport heavy loads of stone on rivers and canals.</p>

<p> Brunelleschi was also like, Vitruvius, a successful hydraulic engineer. It is hard to believe that he wasn’t influenced by&nbsp;<em>De architectura</em>.</p>



<p>There is no doubt about the Vitruvian influence of our next artist-engineer, Mariano di Jacopo (1382–c. 1453) known as Taccola (the jackdaw), who, as I explained in <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/a-renaissance-artist-engineer-icon-vitruvian-man/">an earlier post on that Renaissance iconic figure</a>, included a Vitruvian Man in his drawings. Taccola, who is known to have worked as a sculptor, superintendent of roads and hydraulic engineer, was from Sienna. He met and talked with Brunelleschi, one of the few people known to have done so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taccola produced two annotated manuscripts the four books of&nbsp;<em>De ingeneis</em>, written between 1419 and 1433, and&nbsp;<em>De machnis</em>&nbsp;issued in 1449, which was partially an improved version of his&nbsp;<em>De ingeneis</em>. </p>

<p>Both manuscripts contain numerous illustrations of machines for hydraulic engineering, milling (and mills were one of the most important types of machines in medieval and Renaissance culture), construction and military machinery, all topics covered by Vitruvius. </p>

<p>His manuscripts also some of Brunelleschi’s construction machines. Taccola is in one sense a transitional figure as his representations, of three-dimensional machines, often use medieval drawing conventions rather than Brunelleschi’s recently discovered linear perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taccola’s works were never printed but copies of his manuscripts are known to have circulated widely during his lifetime and to have been highly influential. After his death his influence waned as his work was superceded by the more advance work of Francesco di Giorgio Martini and Leonardo da Vinci both of whom were heavily influenced by Taccola.</p>



<p>Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439–1501) was, like Taccola, from Siena and was an architect, engineer, painter, sculptor, and writer.</p>

<p> His Vitruvian influence is very obvious in his work, as also the influence of Taccola. Francesco worked for much of his life on an Italian translation of Vitruvius’&nbsp;<em>De architectura</em>, which he never published. Like Filarete he wrote an architectural treatise&nbsp;<em>Trattato di archtettura, ingegneria e arte militare</em>, worked on over decades and finished sometime after 1482. Many of his machines are taken from Taccola’s manuscripts. As can be seen from the title, it continues the Vitruvian tradition. Like Filarete’s volume it contains a design for an ideal town. Probably inspired by Sulpizio’s first printed edition of De architectura and Alberti’s&nbsp;<em>De re aedificatoria</em>, he produced a new edition of his own book known as&nbsp;<em>Trattato II.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Both Taccola and Francesco are known to have influenced the most famous of the Renaissance artist-engineers, Leonardo da Vinci. As well as the obvious direct influence of Vitruvius, many of the machines illustrated in Leonardo’s manuscripts are taken from the work of Brunelleschi, Taccola and Francesco di Giorgio. As an apprentice, Leonardo had worked on the final phase of Brunelleschi’s dome for the Santa Maria Cathedral, and he took the opportunity to study Brunelleschi’s building site machines and scaffolding. He owned copies of the manuscripts of both Taccola and Francesco, the latter of which he annotated heavily. Leonardo, as is well known, wrote reams of annotated manuscripts on his machines but never published any of them.</p>

<p>All of the artist-engineers that I have briefly sketched here are examples of artisans who crossed over or better dissolved the boundaries between theoretical and practical knowledge. They are also, so to speak, the stars of a much larger and widespread group of Renaissance artist-engineers, whose influence spread throughout the Renaissance, changing and elevating the status of the skilled artisan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1610, Galileo published his&nbsp;<a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/the-starry-messenger-what-it-said-and-what-that-really-meant/"><em>Sidereus Nuncius,</em></a> the first publication to make known the new astronomical discoveries made with the recently invented telescope. </p>

<p>Although, one should also emphasise that although Galileo was the first to publish, <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/the-emergence-of-modern-astronomy-a-complex-mosaic-part-xxi/">he was not the first to use the telescope as an astronomical instrument, and during that early phase of telescopic astronomy, roughly 1609-1613, several others independently made the same discoveries. </a>There was, as to be expected, a lot of scepticism within the astronomical community concerning the claimed discoveries. The telescopes available at the time were generally of miserable quality and Galileo’s discoveries proved difficult to replicate. It was the Jesuit mathematicians and astronomers in the mathematics department at the Collegio Romano, who would, after initial difficulties, provide the scientific confirmation that Galileo desperately needed. The man, who led the endeavours to confirm or refute Galileo’s claims was the acting head of the mathematics faculty Christoph Grienberger (the professor, Christoph Clavius, was old and infirm). Grienberger is one of those historical figures, who fades into the background because they made no major discoveries or wrote no important books, but he deserves to be better known, and so this brief sketch of the man and his contributions.</p>



<p>As is all too oft the case with Jesuit scholars in the Early Modern Period, we know almost nothing about Grienberger before he joined the Jesuit Order. There are no know portraits of him. The problems start with his name variously given as&nbsp;Bamberga, Bamberger, Banbergiera, Gamberger, Ghambergier, Granberger, Panberger&nbsp;and a total of nineteen variations, history has settled on Grienberger. He was born 2 July 1561 in Hall a small town in the Tyrol in the west of Austria. That’s all we know till he entered the Jesuit Order in 1580. He studied rhetoric and philosophy in Prague from 1583 to 1584. From 1587 he was a mathematics teacher at the Jesuit university in Olmütz. He began his theology studies, standard for a Jesuit, in Vienna in 1589, also teaching mathematics. His earliest surviving letter to Christoph Clavius, who he had never met but who he describes as his teacher, he had studied the mathematical sciences using Clavius’ books, is dated from 1590. In 1591 he moved to the Collegio Romano, where he became Clavius’ deputy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1595, Clavius went to Naples, the purpose of his journey is not clear, but he was away from Rome for somewhat more than a year. During his absence Grienberger took over direction of the mathematics department at the Collegio Romana. From the correspondence between the two mathematicians, during this period, it becomes very obvious that Grienberger does not enjoy being in the limelight. He complains to Clavius about having to give a commencement speech and also about having to give private tuition to the sons of aristocrats. Upon Clavius’ return he fades once more into the background, only emerging again with the commotion caused by the publication of Galileo’s&nbsp;<em>Sidereus Nuncius</em>.</p>



<p>Rumours of Galileo’s discoveries were already making the rounds before publication and, in fact on the day the <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em> appeared, the wealthy German, Humanist Markus Welser (1558–1614) from Augsburg wrote to Clavius asking him his opinion on Galileo’s claims. </p>

<p>We know from letters that the Jesuit mathematicians in the Collegio Romano already had a simple telescope and were making astronomical observations before the publication of the&nbsp;<em>Sidereus Nuncius</em>. They immediately took up the challenge of confirming or refuting Galileo’s discoveries. However, their telescope was not powerful enough to detect the four newly discovered moons of Jupiter. Grienberger was away in Sicily attending to problems at the Jesuit college there, so it was left to Giovanni Paolo Lembo (c. 1570–1618) to try and construct a telescope good enough to complete the task. We know that Lembo was skilled in this direction because between 1615 and 1617 he taught lens grinding and telescope construction to the Jesuits being trained as missionaries to East Asia at the University of Coimbra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lembo’s initial attempts to construct a suitable instrument failed and it was only after Grienberger returned from Sicily that the two of them were able to make progress. At this point Galileo was corresponding with Clavius and urging the Jesuit astronomer on provide the confirmation of his discoveries that he so desperately needed, the general scepsis was very high, but he was not prepared to divulge any details on how to construct good quality telescopes. Eventually, Grienberger and Lembo succeeded in constructing a telescope with which they could observe the moons of Jupiter but only under very good observational conditions. They first observed three of the moons on 14 November 1610 and all four on 16 November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clavius wrote to the merchant and mathematician Antonio Santini (1577–1662) in Venice, who had been to first to confirm the existence of the Jupiter moons in 1610, with a telescope that he constructed himself, detailing observation from 22, 23, 26, and 27 November but stating that they were still not certain as to the nature of the moons. Santini relayed this information to Galileo. On 17 December, Clavius wrote to Galileo:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>…and so we have seen [the Medici Stars] here in Rome many times. At the end of the letter I will put some observations, from which it follows very clearly that they are not fixed but wandering stars, because they change position with respect to each other and Jupiter.</p></blockquote>



<p>Much of what we know about the efforts of the Jesuit astronomers under the leadership of Grienberger to build an adequate telescope to confirm Galileo’s discoveries come from a letter that Grienberger wrote to Galileo in February 1611. One interesting aspect of Grienberger’s letter is that the Jesuit astronomers had also been observing Venus and there is good evidence that <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/the-phases-of-venus-and-heliocentricity-a-rough-guide/">they discovered the phases of Venus independently at least contemporaneously if not earlier than Galileo.</a> This was proof that Venus, and by analogy probably also Mercury, orbit the Sun and not the Earth. This was the death nell for a pure Ptolemaic geocentric system and the acceptance at a minimum of a Capellan system where the two inner planets orbit the Sun, which orbits the Earth, if not a full blown Tychonic system or even a heliocentric one. This was in 1611 troubling for the conservative leadership of the Jesuit Order, but would eventually lead to them adopting a Tychonic system at the beginning of the 1620s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clavius died 6 February 1612 and Grienberger became his official successor as the professor for mathematics at the Collegio Romano, a position he retained until 1633, when he was succeeded in turn by Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680). The was a series of Rules of Modesty in Ignatius of Loyola’s rules for the Jesuit Order and individual Jesuits were expected to self-abnegate. The most extreme aspect of this was that many scientific works were published anonymously as a product of the Order and not the individual. Different Jesuit scholars reacted differently to this principle. On the one hand, Christoph Scheiner (1573–1650), Galileo’s rival in the sunspot dispute and author of the&nbsp;<em>Rosa Ursina sive Sol</em>(1626–1630) presented himself as a great astronomer, which did not endear him to his fellow Jesuits. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Grienberger put his name on almost none of his own work preferring it to remain anonymous. There is only a star catalogue and a set of trigonometrical tables that bear his name.</p>

<p>However, as head of the mathematics department at the Collegio Romano he was responsible for controlling and editing all of the publications in the mathematical disciplines that went out from the Jesuit Order and it is know that he made substantial improvements to the works that he edited both in the theoretical parts and in the design of instruments. A good example is the heliotropic telescope, which enables the observer to track the movement of the Sun whilst observing sunspots, illustrated in Scheiner’s&nbsp;<em>Rosa Ursina</em>. </p>

<p>Grienberger, admired Galileo and took his side, if only in the background, in Galileo’s dispute with the Aristotelians over floating bodies. He was, however, disappointed by <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/the-emergence-of-modern-astronomy-a-complex-mosaic-part-xxv/">Galileo’s unprovoked and vicious attacks on the Jesuit astronomer Orazio Grassi on the nature of comets</a> and explicitly said that it had cost Galileo the support of the Jesuits in his later troubles. He also clearly stated that if Galileo had been content to propose heliocentricity as a hypothesis, its actual scientific status at the time, he could have avoided his confrontation with the Church.</p>



<p>Élie Diodati (1576–1661) the Calvinist, Genevan lawyer and friend of Galileo, who played a central role in the publication of the&nbsp;<em>Discorsi</em>, quoted Grienberger in a letter to Galileo from 25 July 1634, as having said, “If Galileo had recognised the need to maintain the favour of the Fathers of this College, then he would live gloriously in the world, and none of his misfortune would have occurred, and he could have written about any subject, as he thought fit, I say even about the movement of the Earth…” </p>



<p>Several popular secondary sources claim the Grienberger supported the Copernican system. However, there is only hearsay evidence for this claim and not actual proof. He might have but we will never know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grienberger made no major discoveries and propagated no influential new theories, which would launch him into the forefront of the big names, big events style of the history of science. However, he played a pivotal role in the very necessary confirmation of Galileo’s telescopic discoveries. He also successfully helmed the mathematical department of the Collegio Romano for twenty years, which produced many excellent mathematicians and astronomers, who in turn went out to all corners of the world to teach others their disciplines. By the time Athanasius Kircher inherited Grienberger’s post there was a world-wide network of Jesuit astronomers, communicating data on important celestial events. One such was Johann Adam Schall von Bell (1591–1666), who studied under Grienberger and went on to lead the Jesuit mission in China.</p>

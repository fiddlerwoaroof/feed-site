  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To clarify, let me use an example.</p> <p>A user is logging into xyzxyz.com. They type their password, “foobar” into the login, and the password is scrambled through use of whatever functions xyzxyz.com uses for their logins. Maybe it’s put through a one-way hash function and compared to a hash of the password in the website’s databases.</p> <p>Now, an “eavesdropper” sees the login traffic coming into the xyzxyz server. They decide to simply grab the hashed password and send it again, this time with their own computer.</p> <p>This would generate a valid login, wouldn’t it? What mechanisms are in place to prevent this from happening?</p> <p>I’m sorry, I’m sure this is probably a very basic question, but I just haven’t been able to find answers to it online.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nachf\"> /u/Nachf </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/\"> r/crypto </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/pfjlco/what_protocol_prevents_hackers_from_simply/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/pfjlco/what_protocol_prevents_hackers_from_simply/\">[comments]</a></span>"

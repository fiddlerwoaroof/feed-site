  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Greetings,</p> <p>Are there any tools you'd all recommend to perform testing of malware to determine if an AV detects it? I know there's things like virustotal, but to my knowledge VT doesnt utilize dynamic analysis and only performs signature matching?</p> <p>The TLDR version of why I am looking for this tooling is I am a PhD student focused on cyber security and am looking for tools to do research in this area.</p> <p>Thanks all</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Squiggyline91\"> /u/Squiggyline91 </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/\"> r/Malware </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/pflr51/stealth_malware_test/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/pflr51/stealth_malware_test/\">[comments]</a></span>"

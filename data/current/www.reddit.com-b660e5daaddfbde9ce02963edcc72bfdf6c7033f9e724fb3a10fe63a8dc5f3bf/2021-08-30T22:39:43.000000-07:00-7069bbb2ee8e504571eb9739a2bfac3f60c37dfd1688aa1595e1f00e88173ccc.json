  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hello Everyone, The professor told us during our class that we cannot use hash function to send confidential information to othe user. </p> <p>Eg: Alice wants to send a movie to Bob. </p> <p>Professor says She cannot Send the hash of the movie name along with the Encrypted File of the Movie., This is a bad practice and the invader spying on the network and easily get the hash and know the name of the movie. </p> <p>Where as I believe if I send the hash result of the Hash(name of the movie ) along with the Movie in encrypted format it should be sufficient enough. Hash function will help the Bob to verify the authenticity of the Movie he is decrypting.</p> <p>I am still learning, can anyone help me whether the hash function is suitable in this case to protect the confidentiality of the movie and how ?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sweetFLUFFYpanda\"> /u/sweetFLUFFYpanda </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/\"> r/crypto </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/pezowx/how_to_use_hash_function/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/pezowx/how_to_use_hash_function/\">[comments]</a></span>"

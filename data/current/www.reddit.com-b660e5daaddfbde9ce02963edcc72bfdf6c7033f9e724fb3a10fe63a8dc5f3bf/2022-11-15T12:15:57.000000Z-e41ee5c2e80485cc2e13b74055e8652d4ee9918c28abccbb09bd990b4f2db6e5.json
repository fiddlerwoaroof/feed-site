  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I've starting reading about Feistel Ciphers and one thing I am currently confused on is the internal function of a Feistel cipher.</p> <p>I understand that the more complex an internal function is, the more difficult it'll be to attack, and I've read about linear cryptanalysis for multiple plaintext ciphertext pairs, which makes sense to me.</p> <p>However I can't see how, for only one plaintext ciphertext pair and given a weak/linear internal round function - it is easy to gain the key?</p> <p>I've read some methods to do with gaussian elimination, however i don't see how that would be possible in practice?</p> <p>In addition to this, I'm not sure i understand how S-boxes and the internal function are related, because if I pick an internal function such as a bitwise operation, or some other tangible function of the round key and the plaintext block, where do the S-boxes come in?</p> <p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrainNo7044\"> /u/TrainNo7044 </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/\"> r/crypto </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/yvvhav/attacking_a_weak_internalfunction_feistel_cipher/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/yvvhav/attacking_a_weak_internalfunction_feistel_cipher/\">[comments]</a></span>"

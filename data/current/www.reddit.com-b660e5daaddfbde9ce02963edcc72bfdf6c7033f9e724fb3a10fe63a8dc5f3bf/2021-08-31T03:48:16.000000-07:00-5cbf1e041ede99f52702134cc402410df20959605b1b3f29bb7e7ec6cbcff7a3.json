  "content":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I've been analyzing a malicious document with an ActiveX Control to execute the VBA code at auto-start or an event trigger. It also uses the '<strong>caption</strong>' from the Form embedded within the Office document. Now I know I can dump it out using an Office application and fetching it manually, is there a better way to do it without the risk of opening the document?</p> <p>I see oleform.py is used for that purpose but it isn't ready or included in the final toolkit by Didier. Any tips on how to proceed?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/syeedhasan_\"> /u/syeedhasan_ </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/\"> r/Malware </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/pf3djb/dumping_caption_field_of_user_formsactivex/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/pf3djb/dumping_caption_field_of_user_formsactivex/\">[comments]</a></span>"

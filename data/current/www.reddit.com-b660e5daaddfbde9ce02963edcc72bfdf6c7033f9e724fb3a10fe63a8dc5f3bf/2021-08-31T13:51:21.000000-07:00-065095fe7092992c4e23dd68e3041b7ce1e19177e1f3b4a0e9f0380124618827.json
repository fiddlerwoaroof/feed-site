When remote work is <em>not</em> an option, include ONSITE.</p> <p>Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring companyâ€”no recruiting firms or job boards. Only one post per company. If it isn't a household name, please explain what your company does.</p> <p>Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.</p> <p>Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/davidw_-\"> /u/davidw_- </a>   to   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/\"> r/crypto </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/pfelax/whos_hiring/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/pfelax/whos_hiring/\">[comments]</a></span>"

  "content":"Sidekiq 7.0 introduces a new subsystem for gathering job execution data along with a new Metrics tab within the Web UI to visualize this data. The data is designed to help you answer a few questions:\nWhich types of jobs executed? Which types of jobs took the most amount of time to execute? How has the performance of Job X changed recently? When did any deploys occur during this time? The graphs only show data for the last hour."

  "content":"Sidekiq 7.0 can be embedded within another process so you do not need to run a separate Sidekiq process. This is called embedding.\nWhy? Why would you want to do this? Embedding can make for a simpler deployment: you deploy one larger process instead of two separate processes, now you only need to monitor and manage one process. Embedding also requires less total memory since both subsystems will share most of the Ruby data structures and code in memory."

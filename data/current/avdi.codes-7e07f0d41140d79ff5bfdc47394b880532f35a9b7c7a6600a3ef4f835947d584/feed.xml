<p>Hello friends,</p>



<p>I have a summer cold courtesy of my children and I&#8217;m not sure if it is making me more depressed, or providing a distraction from the depression.  Either way, I got that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrL3QxjyVw">summertime sadness</a> fo&#8217; sho.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>What&#8217;s new</h2>



<p>An image that lives in my head courtesy of innumerable movies: an airplane (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD4HjmWLkq8">sail board</a>) in a crash dive, on a bet that the dive will kick-start the engines before it intersects the ground.  That has been the first half of my year: betting I could realize my vision of <a href="https://graceful.dev">Graceful.Dev</a> before I ran out of funds. It was a close one, but as of this past <a href="https://graceful.dev/graceful-dev-birthday-sale-2022/">birthday sale</a>, I&#8217;d say engines are green and this plane is in flight. Thank you to everyone who participated and/or spread the word <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f9e1.png" alt="🧡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f9e1.png" alt="🧡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f9e1.png" alt="🧡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>There&#8217;s always more work to be done, but Graceful.Dev is, finally, the garden of developer learning I&#8217;ve been dreaming of for years. All 10 years of RubyTapas, and much more beyond, organized and groomed into <a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-paths/">living courses</a> and <a href="https://graceful.dev/garden-tours/">garden tours</a>. </p>



<p>I made my first new Ruby screencast in a few months to celebrate: <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/modules/2022/topic/ruby-sequencing-operator/">Ruby Sequencing Operator</a>. Depression notwithstanding, it feels good to be back in the saddle.</p>



<h2>Elsewhere&#8230;</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve also popped my head up a few places online in the last few months:</p>



<ul><li>I&#8217;ve got an article up on InfoQ on developing in containers: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/devcontainers/">Reproducible Development with Devcontainers</a> (based on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4P1xNpklvk">QCon talk of the same name</a>)</li><li>I had a fun chat with Robby Russel for <a href="https://maintainable.simplecast.com/episodes/avdi-grimm-dont-be-too-clingy-to-your-tests">the Maintainable podcast</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.software-engineering-unlocked.com/wordpress-dev-training-business/">I talked Banana Stands with Michaela Greiler of the Software Engineering Unlocked podcast</a>.</li><li>I had a ball <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlnlvEFQ_8Q">taking questions from the Vancouver Ruby Group</a>.</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>What&#8217;s in my head</h2>



<p>So I was at this protest the other day.</p>



<p>Actually, maybe I should back up.</p>



<p>My parents took me to protests when I was a kid. The person I am today would have been in the counter-protests to those marches.</p>



<p>Later, as an adult, I decided protests served little purpose. They conjured up a feeling of solidarity, sure, and reinforced your image of what total assholes the folks on the other side were. But they didn&#8217;t accomplish anything other than feeling good.</p>



<p>Like many technologists I suffered from a bad case of purposiveness. I demanded cost/benefit analyses. I wanted strategy. I wanted to get all Art of War on my goals. I wanted tests-first. I wanted zen calm until the moment of maximum leverage. I aimed to work smarter, not harder. I did not want to be associated with uncontrolled radical elements.</p>



<p>I was conveniently clever. My cleverness gave me a rock-solid excuse not to go to events where people were throwing actual rocks. </p>



<p>The years since 2016 have been an education. Maybe a de-education. I fought the realization for a long time, but I can no longer hide from the fact that the world I&#8217;m leaving to my kids will be a worse one, on many axes, than when I found it. </p>



<p>Now I read histories of people who broke their bodies on the struggle for civil rights and did not live to see any of their dreams realized. I admit to a Black friend that I realize it is a white-people-problem to struggle with the discovery that there is no triumph, that the light brightens and then dims, that progress is not our birthright, that we will not be alive to see the world saved. They laugh at me. Gently, because friends are gentle with each other.</p>



<p>I am less clever than I was. I attend protests now. I don&#8217;t know what good it will do. I don&#8217;t need to know. I know that the people I need to stand with are at those protests. There is a wisdom in their bones that says to gather together, a wisdom beyond cost/benefit analyses. </p>



<p>I know that there are lessons I need to learn in community, and I don&#8217;t know yet what those lessons are. I know people I respect, people I read about in histories and books of poetry, got their start organizing protests like these. I know there are people I need to meet whose faces I don&#8217;t yet know.</p>



<p>I think that maybe I too need to feel the candle-warmth of solidarity.</p>



<p>I tune into my synagogue services every Saturday morning now, while I work in my garden. In 2017 rabbi Susan opened the shul doors as sanctuary to protesters escaping from police violence. Dared the cops to cross holy ground to beat unarmed people protesting police beatings. In 2022 I look over and see rabbi Susan at another protest. I don&#8217;t know what I can accomplish anymore, but I understand better which people I want to be near in the time I have remaining.</p>



<p>Next to my bed now I keep the Gita:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain"><p>You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of the work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established in himself &#8211; without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat.</p></blockquote>



<p>The unit of progress is not a person. The unit of victory, of strategy, of purpose, of justice, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam">tikkun olam</a>, is not a person. All I have is the work in front of me. All I can do is put my body where my mouth is. All I can do is show up.</p>



<p>So anyway, I was at this protest the other day. </p>



<p>It was a protest of police sweeps of unhoused camps. When the cost of those police could easily have housed the people being &#8220;swept&#8221; like so much refuse.</p>



<p>The protest wound through downtown St. Louis. At the feet of glass-and-steel towers. Past corporate art. It obstructed traffic. An angry white man stepped out of his car, screaming red-faced at the inconvenience. Over it all the Gateway Arch gleamed, built on low-rent districts condemned and bulldozed to milk money from the federal government.</p>



<p>Elon Musk had recently announced his intent to buy Twitter as part of a midlife break-up tantrum. And I got to thinking about the discourse around the ethical use of corporate social media. A lot of people were once again asking: where is the line at which the odious billionaire you are ultimately enriching is simply <em>too</em> odious, and you take your ethical stand by <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-14.htm">shaking the dust off your feet</a> and bailing?</p>



<p>Alongside this was the familiar discourse about the social media we <em>really</em> need, and what that might look like. Is it Mastodon? Should the government nationalize Twitter and Facebook? Surely, there should be some uncommercial agora where everyone could have their voice heard equally. But what does &#8220;equal&#8221; even look like in a world of viral disinformation and willing human sock-puppets?</p>



<p>So there we were, wending our way messily, raggedly, inconveniently at the feet of proud corporate towers, and it got me thinking: this is what we are on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, on (ugh) TikTok. There is no gleaming agora at the end of the rainbow for democratic discussion, for demands for equality, for protests for reproductive rights, for social justice. The important conversations are always going to be inconvenient. They are always going to be at the edges of &#8220;community standards&#8221;, unequally enforced. </p>



<p>The grubbiness, the out-of-place-ness, isn&#8217;t a bug, it&#8217;s a feature. The heroic triumphalism that plans for the <em>right</em> community, the <em>right</em> rules, the <em>right</em> financial incentives: that&#8217;s a bug, not a feature. There&#8217;s no elegant app for democracy. True community, solidarity, radical progress, is grubby and in-the-way. It&#8217;s an exploit, not a planned use-case. It&#8217;s a remix. </p>



<p>The unit of progress is larger than a person and smaller than a social network.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve decided don&#8217;t care who owns the gleaming towers. And I&#8217;ve given up on the dream of replacing them with <em>better</em> gleaming towers by better people. I don&#8217;t care about the purpose of the system. I&#8217;m gonna be camped out under overpasses as long as I can be, holding up my candle, getting in the way. Online, and in the streets.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>I hit &#8220;publish&#8221; at that point and went to seek solace in cold iron, but a coda occurred to me while lifting.</p>



<p>Last Saturday, the parashah was <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.22.5?lang=bi&amp;aliyot=0">Balaam&#8217;s Ass</a>. A weird one, <a href="https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/torah-commentary/balaams-talking-ass">by anyone&#8217;s reckoning</a>. </p>



<p>Rabbi Susan <a href="https://youtu.be/efup1v8g9Gg?t=780">re-told the story thusly</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain"><p> Whoever this guy is, Balaam, prophet, sorcerer, something holy, something out of the ordinary. But he doesn&#8217;t see everything. And his donkey does, somehow. He has this trusted donkey that he&#8217;s been traveling with, and the donkey leads him off the road and he beats him three times. </p><p>And finally the donkey says: &#8220;What gives?! All these years we&#8217;ve worked together. We&#8217;ve walked together? And now you&#8217;re beating me.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Well you ran me off the road!&#8221;</p><p>He says: &#8220;Open your eyes! Big shot prophet. Open your eyes and look.&#8221;</p><p>And he stops for a moment. He slows down. Because&#8230; He&#8217;s on his way and he&#8217;s hurrying and he thinks he knows what to do thinks he knows all the answers<br>to solve all the problems. </p><p>He thinks he knows. But he&#8217;s goin&#8217; too fast. Feels too desperate.</p><p>I know that feeling. I want to fix abortion. I want to fix gun violence. I want to fix everything.</p><p>Sometimes you go too fast. You don&#8217;t see the dangers on the road. And so the donkey opens Balaam&#8217;s eyes. And he sees the angel there with the sword. He would have been killed by it, if he had kept on the path he was on.</p><p>&#8230;so when he gets to the mountaintop, and he&#8217;s ready to curse the people. What I like to think is that he slowed down. Took his time. [&#8230;] Slowing down allowed Balaam&#8230; to look into the tents, and instead of a curse, he gave us a blessing.</p></blockquote>



[transcription errors are mine]



<p>Balaam starts out under the curse of purpose, of goal-orientation. As I tease apart the knotted ball of racism and colonialism and patriarchy in my own head, I find myself wanting to saddle my donkey. But more and more I understand that purposiveness itself, that goal-orientation, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a> are <em>themselves</em> the &#8220;master&#8217;s tools&#8221; that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/291810-for-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house">will never dismantle the master&#8217;s house</a>. </p>



<p>Balak says to cut this gordian knot with a sword. Balaam&#8217;s Ass says that unraveling it inch by inch will change me in ways I can&#8217;t conceive. And whatever emerges will be less frayed, more connected, and stronger for it.</p>

<p>A correspondent once took issue with my amplification of <a href="https://alex-hanna.medium.com/on-racialized-tech-organizations-and-complaint-a-goodbye-to-google-43fd8045991d">Alex Hanna&#8217;s indictment of Google as a racialized organization</a>. They objected that Hanna&#8217;s accusations weren&#8217;t backed up &#8220;rigorously&#8221;. I&#8217;m publishing a version of my reply here because I may want to reference it in the future.</p>



<span id="more-13182"></span>



<p>Our most &#8220;rational&#8221; professions have a long history of looking for the most convoluted explanations of obvious bias, and calling it &#8220;rigor&#8221;. A recent example: we know as a historical fact that &#8220;computer programmer&#8221; started as a female-dominated profession, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html">until women were systematically pushed out in the 1970s and 80s</a>. But that did nothing to keep logical, rigorous people from&#8212;by the time I got to the profession&#8212;advancing all kinds of explanations about how women were just &#8220;not natural programmers&#8221;. <em>Anything</em> except the simplest answer of all.</p>



<p>This sort of thing turns out to be everywhere. The very methods of statistical significance in scientific results <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nautil.us/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics-9365/" target="_blank">were explicitly developed by eugenicists to validate their foregone belief that black people were closer to monkeys than white people</a>. Nor were those men disappointed in their &#8220;rigorous&#8221; results, either: their methods&#8212;applied to the data they selected and accepted&#8212;confirmed their convictions.</p>



<p>And, of course, there is a vast amount of data around the mechanics of implicit white supremacy: things like people picking one identical resume over another because the person has a &#8220;white-sounding&#8221; name. </p>



<p>After discarding the false logic of over-complicated post-facto rationalizations, we&#8217;re left with this: if a &#8220;meritocratic&#8221; organization is overwhelmingly white in a society that is not, it means one of two things:</p>



<ol><li>They are artificially obstructing nonwhite participation (in ways that you and I may not be able to see)</li><li>Non-white folks have less merit.</li></ol>



<p>#2 is racism. #1 is white supremacy &#8211; a system in which white participants are treated as the default, and there&#8217;s extra friction for nonwhite participants. Any notional #3 one might propose violates Occam&#8217;s Razor.</p>



<p>To start with the incontrovertible data point of an organization which is dramatically less diverse than its surrounding society&#8230; And then to immediately search for anything&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;than the simplest and most common explanation (a system of implicit or overt white supremacy) is itself bias. Not rigor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This book is intended as a programmer&#8217;s introduction or refresher to the Blub programming language. It is incomplete, opinionated, and short.</p>



<p>We assume that you are a working programmer with several years experience in at least one common &#8220;conventional&#8221; programming language: e.g. BASIC, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Perl, Ruby, Lua. By the time you finish this book, we intend that you&#8217;ll be able to:</p>



<ul><li>Read and make sense of conventionally-written Blub code.</li><li>Navigate a Blub codebase and understand how the parts fit together.</li><li>Diagnose unexpected program behaviors.</li><li>Make meaningful additions and changes to a codebase in idiomatic Blub style.</li></ul>



<p>Like all books in the &#8220;Enough ___&#8221; series, this book adheres to a few fundamental principles:</p>



<h2>Learn from living code</h2>



<p>You will not find the usual progression of &#8220;syntax, flow control, functions, data types, tools&#8221; here. Like a real-world software project, we will chuck you directly into the deep end of a mature Blub codebase. Nearly all of the examples in this book are drawn from the same project, which you can (and are encouraged to) run on your own machine.</p>



<p>Over the course of this book you will build up your understanding of Blub by interacting with that codebase: reading code, making changes, and seeing how those changes impact the behavior of the code. We will introduce you to Blub syntax, semantics, data types, and abstractions in a just-time-fashion, as needed.</p>



<h2>Fast-forward through the boring bits</h2>



<p>We assume you understand typical programming features like scalar datatypes, <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements, and functions. You don&#8217;t need to know that you can write a hexadecimal literal by prefixing it with <code>0x</code>. You <em>do</em> need to know if, as in JavaScript, that hexadecimal number will actually be stored as a floating-point value, rather than as an integer.</p>



<p>We will endeavor to speed through the unsurprising aspects of Blub, and focus on the less usual aspects.</p>



<h2>No hype</h2>



<p>There are lots of programming languages. Blub is fine. Other programming languages are also fine. Life is too short to wax breathless about how destructuring assignment is going to change your life.</p>



<p>You need to get shit done in Blub. We will show you how.</p>



<h2>Acknowledge history</h2>



<p><em>Things are the way they are because they got that way</em>.</p>



<p>All programming languages have quirks. Some of them are intentional design decisions; others are historical accidents. Most are somewhere in between.</p>



<p>Over the course of decades of language geekery, your authors have all experienced the slow retconning of acknowledged language warts into &#8220;the right way to do it&#8221; by over-eager language fan[atic]s. We promise not to blow sunshine up your ass about historical misfeatures.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re also not going to linger over them. We believe that getting hung up on language oddities is a waste of time, and that language snobbery is actively harmful. We will call out surprising behavior. We may giggle over it, briefly. We&#8217;ll try to provide just enough context to make it a little less surprising, where possible.</p>



<p>And then we&#8217;ll move on.</p>



<h2>Go with the grain</h2>



<p>Not all language surprises are mistakes. Every programming language has its own <em>grain</em>; its own set of idiomatic styles, patterns, processes and tools that fit together into a productive workflow.</p>



<p>For example, statically-typed languages like Java and Haskell and their associated tools give you lots of support for writing correct code before you ever compile and run it. Python and Ruby, by contrast, offer fewer static aids, but reward constant small the-proof-is-in-running-the-code experiments in the REPL and in unit tests. </p>



<p>We don&#8217;t believe in making excuses for warts. We <em>also</em> have little patience for attempts to write Blub in the style of some other language, followed by complaints that it&#8217;s painful to do so. Where Blub code and style is surprisingly, intentionally different from other languages, we will show you how to swim with the current rather than fighting it.</p>



<h2>Learn within a system</h2>



<p>Unlike other books, we will not relegate discussion of the essential tools of day-to-day development to appendices. We will teach you Blub in the context of a typical, batteries-included Blub programming environment. Including command-line tools, editors and editor extensions, testing tools, debuggers, tracing tools, etc.</p>



<p>We will definitely not give you a comprehensive introduction to any of these tools, but we&#8217;ll make sure you have pointers to more information for when you need it.</p>



<h2>Be opinionated</h2>



<p>We intend to equip you to write robust, legible, idiomatic Blub code. Toward this end, we will specifically call out elements of the Blub language and libraries that are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sus</strong>: Inspired by the popular game <em>Among Us</em>, using <em>sus</em> features doesn&#8217;t automatically make you a saboteur of quality code&#8230; but you&#8217;d better know what you&#8217;re doing, and be able to explain yourself.</li><li><strong>Hinky</strong>: These features might not be outright warts, but they will almost certainly surprise you if you don&#8217;t realize how they differ from similar constructs in another language. E.g. the way a string containing the numeral <code>&quot;0&quot;</code> is considered &#8220;falsy&#8221; in PHP. Or the way Ruby will <em>not</em> automatically convert numbers into strings, and will instead raise an exception.</li><li><strong>Bogus</strong>: Bogus features exist for backwards compatibility. They might even still be used by some programmers. But you shouldn&#8217;t use them. Example: the way C&#8217;s <code>strcat()</code> is unsafe at any speed.</li></ul>



<h2>That&#8217;s it</h2>



<p>Blub is a programming language. You need to know Blub to get shit done. Let&#8217;s learn Blub.</p>

<p>Spring is in the air, here in St. Louis. Nothing is blooming yet, but the daffodils are looking optimistic. I find myself, for the first time, attempting to plan a garden. In preparation for the warmer months I also finished cleaning the last of the moving-overflow out of my garage, a feat of which I am unreasonably proud.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s New</h2>



<p>A lot! Let&#8217;s see&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>The other day I sat down (virtually) with Rails performance maestro <a href="https://www.speedshop.co/">Nate Berkopec</a> for a whirlwind introduction to how he instruments and diagnoses web app performance issues. We recorded the session, and with the help of Tyler the Content Minion I&#8217;ve edited it into four ~20-minute fully-transcribed and annotated videos, and added them to the <em><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/robust-ruby">Robust Ruby</a></em> course. </li><li>&#8230;which brings me to:  <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/robust-ruby"><strong><em>Robust Ruby</em></strong></a> is now <strong>done.<em> </em></strong>Finally! 24 RubyTapas-extracted videos plus these brand-new Rails performance videos, covering an array of topics loosely organized around the production concerns of monitoring, optimizing, and failure -management. It&#8217;s available as a standalone course, or as part of a <a href="https://graceful.dev/join">Graceful.Dev Pro</a> membership. If you&#8217;re reading this as a SIGAVDI subscriber, you can take 10% off either one with code: []</li><li>I&#8217;ve continued to write about the practice of running a &#8220;banana stand&#8221; business. I wrote about <a href="https://avdi.codes/the-pre-sale-trap/" data-type="post" data-id="13094">The Pre-Sale Trap</a>: how I&#8217;ve done myself few favors by pre-selling products that didn&#8217;t exist yet. And about <a href="https://avdi.codes/the-enterprise-riptide/" data-type="post" data-id="13121">The Enterprise Riptide</a> and why I&#8217;m presently in the process of replacing most of the services my business has relied on over the past 10+ years.</li></ul>

<h2>What&#8217;s on my mind&#8230;</h2>



<p>At some point in my late teens or early twenties I discovered Christopher Hitchens, and his collection of essays <em>Letters to a Young Contrarian</em>. &#8220;Contrarian!&#8221; I thought. What a wonderful word. That&#8217;s what I am, I decided: a contrarian!</p>



<p>I had been groomed to be a contrarian before I ever heard the term. I was raised in the backwoods by a dad who proudly proclaimed us to be &#8220;weird&#8221;. Normal was bad, in my childhood lexicon. Ordinary was something other people were. Less interesting people.</p>



<p>I was also raised on unconventional ideas. Like Creation Science: the assertion that the history related in the Bible is factually accurate in all of its particulars, and nature backs it up. If you know where to look.</p>



<p>I grew up with picture books of dinosaurs coexisting with humans on an earth that was only 10,000 years old. Explanations of how the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan">Leviathan</a>&#8221; of Job was in fact a dragon-dinosaur, and how dragons could (in turn) be explained in terms of modern bombardier beetles. I remember being driven hours away to some convention where Creation Scientists were giving speeches about how some gorge being cut by a flood in a few days disproved everything &#8220;known&#8221; about how long it takes for canyons to form.</p>



<p>Many of my adult mentors who shared these beliefs were well-educated, thoughtful, in some cases legitimately brilliant people. They had jobs doing technical work like audio engineering and circuit design for satellites. How could these people be mistaken? Clearly, the rest of the world was in the dark.</p>



<p>It was all very exciting. We were weird, and we knew better than anyone else! This background primed me for future contrarianism as a young adult, and by the time I discovered that word I was more than happy to claim it.</p>



<p>Having these experiences young left me with certain lifelong impressions:</p>



<p>First, I recognize that the urge to contrarianism is real, and that I have it to a strong degree. I can see where my opinions often germinate from wanting to believe the opposite of the conventional wisdom, and then looking for facts to support this angle.</p>



<p>I still indulge my contrarianism on some topics. For instance:</p>



<ul><li>Believing that Apple computers hasn&#8217;t been a very good computer company for a while now (in my defense, I was ALSO right about Apple being the future of laptops back when the first TiBook was launched <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f61d.png" alt="😝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</li><li>Believing that everything about the way we do tech hiring is wrong and regressive and borderline abusive.</li></ul>



<p>…but I am at least a tiny bit aware that my urge to be contrary often precedes my developed, elaborated opinions.</p>



<p>Second, I feel like I can often recognize this contrarian streak in others.</p>



<p>And third, I feel like I understand the <em>momentum of contrarianism</em>. It&#8217;s this last point I want to talk more about.</p>



<p>There is a belief floating around out there that given enough information and enough sunlight, <em>the truth will win</em>. How can lies and conspiracy theories survive in a world with ready access to voluminous amounts of scientific research?? How can any rational person continue to take themselves seriously, talking about Adam and Eve riding their pet Triceratops to the Tree of Life?</p>



<p>And then we have a global pandemic. And suddenly, somehow, enough people believe that vaccinations and masks are a global conspiracy of subjugation, for that belief system to shift public health policy!</p>



<p>I know there has been sociological research on this phenomenon. I&#8217;ve only read a little of it, and I can&#8217;t remember enough to link to a paper. I just know what I&#8217;ve experienced. And what I can tell you is this: <em>the more contrarian you are, the more your world will confirm your beliefs. No matter how outlandish they are.</em></p>



<p>I experience this myself, still. It works like this:</p>



<ul><li>I rant about (let&#8217;s say) tech job interview practices on Twitter</li><li>Most people shake their heads and scroll on: Avdi is on one of his sanctimonious tears again.</li><li>A few people engage with me, equivocating, about how it isn&#8217;t <em>all</em> bad</li><li>A few people feel seen and validated in a way they didn&#8217;t before, and get in contact with me about their horrible experiences. They point their friends to my writings as well.</li><li>This last experience is my strongest signal! I feel totally validated, like I&#8217;m <em>onto something</em>. I&#8217;ve uncovered the dirty laundry under the bed!</li><li>I use what people have confided (in privacy-respecting ways) to feed future, even more pointed rants.</li><li>Plenty of people might disagree with me, but don&#8217;t have the energy or will to engage. Many more just don&#8217;t care.</li><li>My loudest feedback is<ul><li>a) people who vociferously agree with me, and</li><li>b) people who disagree with me so violently that they feel compelled to reply. This latter self-selecting category is often so cartoonishly opposed to everything I&#8217;m saying that they <em>reinforce</em> my beliefs in a harmful system that is indoctrinating people.</li></ul></li><li>As a result, I feel like I&#8217;m tapped into a deep vein of truth!</li></ul>



<p>I can see this cycle at work, and <em>also</em> think I&#8217;m right about tech hiring. Contrarianism doesn&#8217;t make you <em>wrong</em>, per se. Often it functions as useful prompt to question assumptions.</p>



<p>The important thing to understand about this phenomenon is that <em>you will always be validated in your contrarianism</em>. There isn&#8217;t some green lamp that lights up when your contrarianism draws you to uncover a hidden truth, and a loud buzzer that goes brrrrrrrrrrrrt when it leads you down a dead-end alley.</p>



<p>The fact that there are actual, literal flat-earthers in this day and age is proof that there is no belief so unhinged that the momentum of contrarianism won&#8217;t carry you further into it. If you let it. The further you go, the more most people will roll their eyes and distance themselves, the more a few very motivated people will feverishly encourage you, the more those latter people will fill your personal sphere, and the further you will go.</p>



<p>And at some point you cross the line from contrarianism, into the momentum of radicalization.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rationality&#8221; is no impediment to this slide, because the methods of rationality are trivially subverted&#8212;especially by smart people who <em>believe </em>themselves to be rational. If anything, rational skeptics are more prone. Often they come out of an insular religious/cultural background like mine, and they attribute their own self-extraction from a cult-ish belief system to their contrarian streak. If you believe you liberated yourself from a false <em>belief</em>&#8212;rather than, in truth, having liberated yourself from a niche <em>belief reinforcement cycle</em>&#8212;it can be hard to know when to <em>stop</em> disbelieving everything said by the people around you.</p>



<p>(This is where <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/the-outside-view/">the Outside View</a> can come in handy.)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s relatively easy to trigger someone&#8217;s slide down this slope, if you understand the cycle. Statements like &#8220;<em>Some people are asking questions about [insert provocative, seemingly outlandish assertion]</em>&#8221; work well. At first they might dig to give the lie to this absurd suggestion. But in the back of the contrarian head, there&#8217;s that little buzz of &#8220;what if there is hidden knowledge to be discovered…?&#8221;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll hear these teases in popular podcasts that play to the egos of people who pride themselves on &#8220;questioning everything&#8221;.</p>



<p>Or perhaps you&#8217;ll notice it in the increasingly reactionary writings of a &#8220;bad boy&#8221; tech rock star. Maybe one who experienced so much success and adulation from running his company in a contrarian fashion, that the contrarian validation loop has become his north star.</p>



<p>Just as a random example.</p>



<p>Contrarianism is a hell of a drug. Eventually whatever you are &#8220;anti&#8221; doesn&#8217;t spark that giddy mix of scandal and intrigue anymore. That feeling of a blindfold ripped away. You start looking at your friends as the new sheeple, and for ways to stand apart from them.</p>



<p>Christopher Hitchens, having cut his teeth in the 1960s Marxist counter-culture and anti-theism, eventually turned his contrarianism on the Left. He picked fights that won him the attention and adulation of a brand-new reactionary audience. His writing turned to bloody-minded misogynist warmongering before he died in 2011. </p>



<p>I have little doubt the pull of contrarianism will always be with me.  Sometimes it will even lead me to insight. But this note is a reminder to myself that the fact that &#8220;everyone is doing it&#8221; doesn&#8217;t automatically make &#8220;it&#8221; suspect. A personal prod to define myself less in terms of what I&#8217;m against. Or even in terms of what I&#8217;m for. I think the heuristic of &#8220;<a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons">who I&#8217;m with</a>&#8221; is a steadier compass.</p>

<p>We made the most of the cold snowless days this winter with lots of co-op board games. Particularly Arkham Horror (<a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/">the card game version</a>, now) and <a href="https://cephalofair.com/pages/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a>. And also <a href="https://www.wildermyth.com/">Wildermyth</a>, which is technically a computer game, but basically counts as a co-op board game.</p>

<span id="more-13121"></span>



<p>There&#8217;s this phenomenon in SaaS offerings. Often, they start out serving small businesses and solo entrepreneurs. But if they survive, they almost inevitably pivot to serving large enterprise accounts. They raise their prices (sometimes as a sudden and rude surprise, *cough*Drip*cough*). Their support process becomes byzantine. They focus all their developer time on new enterprise-friendly features like SSO. They stop paying attention to the bug reports and feature requests from the indie creators who gave them their first business&#8212;unless those creators have gone corporate right along with them.</p>



<p>I think of this as the SaaS enterprise riptide. Almost every scrappy company eventually gets pulled out into the enterprise/ecommerce depths. This is, after all, where the money is.</p>



<p>I say <em>almost</em> every. a few companies avoid this undertow. Examples that come to mind: ConvertKit. Gumroad. Linode. There&#8217;s a pretty obvious common denominator: these are companies that are bootstrapped, self-funded, and self-owned. As Jessitron pointed out when we were talking about this phenomenon, taking VC funding makes the riptide unavoidable. You can&#8217;t get your VCs to their big payoff without swimming with the whales.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not to say that every bootstrapped company stays indie-focused, nor that they <em>should</em>. It&#8217;s a necessary prerequisite, but not sufficient. The leadership still has to <em>choose</em> to keep swimming in the shallows. But if they are dancing on VC strings, it&#8217;s not a choice they get to make.</p>



<p>Anyway, this is not an article about how to fund your SaaS. The point is this: if you run a banana stand for a decade or more, you&#8217;re gonna encounter this riptide. Your tools are going to grow steadily away from you, even as they charge you more. Periodically, you&#8217;re going to have to swim sideways to land on the next generation of scrappy, indie-creator-focused service providers. Being shocked and disappointed when this happens is a waste of energy (boy have I wasted a lot of energy).</p>



<p>Oh, and I know it&#8217;s hard sometimes to suss out who a company <em>really</em> serves, since they all try to sound like they are all things to all customers.  Back when I was getting started, the best tell of an indie-friendly startup was that they had an active Twitter account. As of 2022, the best telltale seems to be that they have a freely joinable Discord channel (<strong>not</strong> a Slack). Just FYI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A week ago I migrated my membership site Graceful.Dev from Nexcess to <a href="http://cloudways.com/">Cloudways</a>. It was a pretty low-drama process, and I thought I&#8217;d write down what made it so while the memory is fresh.</p>



<p>First, a little bit of background for my developer nerds: moving a WordPress site isn&#8217;t quite like moving a Rails or Django or Java Spring site. A professional wordpress site consists of:</p>



<ol><li>WordPress itself, an off-the-shelf open-source application</li><li>A wp-config.php file, which usually contains hosting-specific customizations.</li><li>A collection of off-the-shelf plugins in a plugins directory, including licensed premium plugins</li><li>A <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-why-and-how-tos-of-creating-a-site-specific-wordpress-plugin/">site-specific plugin</a> for custom-coded modifications to WordPress or plugin behavior.</li><li>At least one off-the-shelf theme, in a subdirectory</li><li>A site-specific child-theme which adds local tweaks to the base theme</li><li>A database full of content <em>as well as </em>configuration</li><li>A directory full of uploaded images and other media, for attachment to blog posts etc.</li></ol>



<p>Of these, only #4 and #6 are amenable to being version-controlled. Trying to keep the whole shebang in a VC repo is a recipe for pain and for falling behind on security patches. </p>



<p>Broadly speaking, moving an active multi-user WordPress site from one host to another goes like this:</p>



<ol><li>Do an initial migration of WordPress-and-plugins-and-themes-and-database to the new host, exposed on some temporary domain.</li><li>Mess around with the new copy for a while. Remove caching plugins that were only relevant to the old host, enable any plugins that are specific to the new host (a lot of WordPress-centric hosts have their own recommended configuration for caching, backups, etc.). Ensure everything works as expected on the new host. This process might take a couple days.</li><li>Add the new host to your continuous delivery automations for pushing out your site-specific plugin and child theme.</li><li><strong>[somehow] pull any database changes that happened in the meantime&#8211;updates to user accounts, comments, course progress, etc.&#8211;onto the new site without overwriting any of your host-specific tweaks.</strong></li><li><strong>Do the same thing for any media that was added since the copy was made.</strong></li><li>Re-point the DNS from the old host to the new host</li><li>Update the new site to think it lives at the canonical domain. </li></ol>



<p>There are lots of tools to help you copy a WordPress site whole-hog from one site to another. Every host offers some variation on a one-shot migration. It&#8217;s #4 and #5 that are the tricky bits: copying over the things that have <em>changed</em> since you started the migration process, before retiring the old site.</p>



<p>For me, this was where <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/">WP Migrate DB Pro</a> came in. This plugin (when used with its pro addons) can push or pull not just database records, but media files, plugins, and themes from one WordPress site to another. I&#8217;d been using it for months to pull the latest version of production into my staging site, for testing and experimentation.</p>



<p>Since WP Migrate DB was already in place in my workflow, the process of migrating to a new host was, essentially:</p>



<ol><li>Provision a vanilla WordPress installation</li><li>Install <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/">WP Migrate DB Pro</a> and add pull credentials for the original site</li><li>Migrate everything with WP Migrate DB</li><li>Tweak, test, yadda yadda</li><li>Continue to pull database and media updates as-needed with WP Migrate DB</li><li>Switchover once everything is ready and working</li></ol>



<p>(As a bonus, WP Migrate DB Pro also includes a handy DB find-and-replace for updating hardcoded URLs once the switchover is complete.)</p>



<p>A shout-out as well to my DNS host <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple</a>, which makes updating DNS records painless and fast.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not careful, running a <a href="https://avdi.codes/the-banana-stand/" data-type="post" data-id="12898">banana stand</a> can feel like an endless bootstrap. Which works about as well as running a nation in a constant state of emergency. Or a body on nothing but caffeine and adrenaline.</p>



<p>Emergency states normalize emergency measures. Like the &#8220;pre-sale&#8221;.</p>



<span id="more-13094"></span>



<p>A pre-sale is when you sell a product that technically doesn&#8217;t exist yet. Or maybe it&#8217;s partially complete. This is the model that Kickstarter made ubiquitous.</p>



<p>As many successful Kickstarter campaigns prove, it is possible to do pre-sale well. But it&#8217;s also easy to let <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivor bias</a> lull you into a false sense of optimism about pre-sales. And as many Kickstarter veterans will tell you, even &#8220;succeeding&#8221; can turn into a traumatic, burnout-inducing experience. </p>



<p>A lot of the hustle porn literature talks up pre-sales as a panacea. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps! Prove your market segment before you commit any effort! Fund your future work so you can quit your job and finally write that book about keeping honey badgers as housepets!</p>



<p>Look, pre-sales work for some people. But in my experience, they are a lot dicier than the hustle bros would have you believe. </p>



<p>Life is a complex and scary place, full of unexpected&#8230; <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/may-you-live-in-interesting-times.html">excitement</a>. In my experience, taking people&#8217;s money in exchange for future products is a bit like poking a sleeping bear. &#8220;Hey!&#8221; you are shouting at the universe. &#8220;Look at me! I am taking a biiiiig risk! Mortgaging my future labor for money up-front! It&#8217;s a good thing my life is uncomplicated and I have lots of free time! It sure would suck to have some kind of unexpected family health issue crop up! Or a complicated divorce! Or a global pandemic!&#8221;</p>



<p>I stand before you as a cautionary tale. I have a number of exciting new content projects I would love to be working on. But I&#8217;m not working on any of them right now. </p>



<p>Partly, that&#8217;s because I am putting time into shoring up the infrastructure of my banana stand, working on partnerships, technical underpinnings, marketing automations, and whatnot. But it&#8217;s also because I am, at the time I&#8217;m writing this, making good on promised work that goes back&#8212;I wish I was kidding&#8212;<em>eight years</em>.</p>



<p>Ugh, I don&#8217;t want to do this, but let&#8217;s make this concrete. The current stack of promised work-in-progress (WIP) I am paying down, as far as I can remember:</p>



<ul><li><strong><em>The Rake Field Manual</em>:<em> </em></strong>An &#8220;easy&#8221; book project <a href="https://avdi.codes/new-book-birthday-sale/">I tossed out for pre-sale in 2014</a>. Now <a href="https://graceful.dev/site-news-4-a-course-about-project-automation/">reincarnated as <em>A Course About Project Automation</em></a><em>.</em> Projected completion date: unknown, but I&#8217;ve at last I&#8217;ve given myself a framework to work in where site automation work naturally leads into adding new content to this project. I consider this to be about as on-track a status as is likely for this project.</li><li><em><strong>The Capacitor Sessions:</strong></em> a series of recorded pairing sessions between me and Betsy Haibel, promised as part of <em><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/moom/">Master the Object-Oriented Mindset</a></em> (MOOM).  The video for these has been &#8220;in the can&#8221; since at least 2018, but editing it turned out to be a huge project. As of late 2021 I have a new video editor, who is adding new 20-minute videos to the MOOM course every week or so.  Status: on-track.</li><li><em><strong>Robust Ruby</strong></em>: a course I pre-sold in July 2019. As an extracted course from the RubyTapas series, most of the content already existed. But I also promised some bonus material in the form of recorded collaborations with a Rails performance expert. Almost three years later, I finally have the first of those sessions scheduled for recording ????.</li></ul>



<p>This is a pretty painful and embarrassing list to write, but I think it&#8217;s important to be transparent. It&#8217;s easy to promise something you &#8220;know&#8221; you can deliver. But then life happens. And sometimes the &#8220;easiest&#8221; projects turn out to be uninspiring&#8212;or your inspiration moves on to new ideas&#8212;and suddenly they aren&#8217;t so easy.</p>



<p>To quote Admiral Ackbar: it&#8217;s a trap! </p>



<p>Or, maybe it isn&#8217;t. Look, I know plenty of people who do great with pre-sales. Maybe you are one of them. This cautionary sign isn&#8217;t for everyone. But I think it&#8217;s important to temper the enthusiasm about pre-sales so often seen in the hustle press. </p>



<p>How to mitigate the danger of pre-sales? Here are a few ideas:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Know thyself</strong>. Some of this comes down to understanding and accepting your own work style. After over a decade of running my banana stand, I know some of my limitations. I&#8217;m far less eager to launch pre-sales now.</li><li><strong>Sell a workshop instead of pre-selling a course/book.</strong> This is a strategy I&#8217;m really liking lately. Do you know enough about a topic to teach it to people? Instead of planning out a whole course and pre-selling it, schedule a workshop, maybe 2-6 days long (spread over a couple of weeks). Cap attendance at a manageable number, like a dozen people. <em>Showing up</em> for a workshop for two weeks is a much more manageable commitment than building out a whole course or book. And what&#8217;s more, the live interaction will give you invaluable insights into what your audience is most interested or confused about.</li><li><strong>Make pre-sales conditional.</strong> Don&#8217;t take people&#8217;s money until you hit a specified funding level. Calculate what it will take to enable you to work full-time on the project. Then double that number.</li><li><strong>Mind those extras.</strong> A lot of marketing advice out there hammers on the importance of having a long bullet-list of &#8220;bonuses&#8221; to make a book or course feel like a great value. And, I mean yeah, they say this because it works. But it&#8217;s way too easy to promise yourself into a unexpected amount of labor with your extras. Especially if the extras involve coordinating with other people. Try to promise bonus materials that are low effort <em>for you</em> and your work style. </li><li><strong>Limit your WIP:</strong> Only one unfinished project at a time. No big exciting announcements until the last project is wrapped up.</li><li><strong>Manage expectations of completion:</strong> &#8220;completeness&#8221; is overrated. Especially in the tech field, where things move so fast. One of my big shifts in creating <a href="https://graceful.dev">Graceful.Dev</a> has been that I think of it and talk about it as <em>a garden of living courses</em>. No completion promised or expected, just perpetual growth and grooming.</li></ul>



<p>Finally, let&#8217;s talk <strong>emergency management</strong>: Being brutally honest with you, most of my pre-sales have been launched while staring down terrifying family financial crunches. I&#8217;m not going to tell you not to have financial shortfalls. But be aware that a pre-sale launched in response to an emergency can easily turn into a &#8220;now you have <em>two</em> problems&#8221; situation.</p>



<p>If you already have <a href="https://avdi.codes/your-mailing-list/" data-type="post" data-id="12911">the audience</a> to successfully launch a pre-sale in response to a crisis, consider simply <em>asking for money</em> instead. I know, I know, it&#8217;s not the American way, but it turns out that if you are out there doing good work in the world, a lot of people are gonna be willing to <a href="https://avdi.codes/the-tote-bag-economy/" data-type="post" data-id="12955">support you just for being you</a>. It feels a lot better to delight donors with surprise goodies than to disappoint customers with delayed products. This is one reason I have <a href="https://www.patreon.com/avdigrimm">a Patreon</a> in <em>addition</em> to my &#8220;banana stand&#8221; content businesses.</p>



<p>Running a banana stand shouldn&#8217;t feel like a death march. It shouldn&#8217;t make you feel guilty every time you reflect on your catalog of &#8220;unfinished&#8221; work. That kind of stress is what real jobs are for.</p>



<p>So, I hope you take a lesson from my mistakes and temper the urge to pre-sell. Cheers.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s do some bullets, shall we?</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Good</h2>



<ul><li>Anyone who cares about science and also about people has to struggle with teasing apart problematic scientists from their undeniably important research. But the more we understand the way science sets the very boundaries of the questions we ask, the more we realize how repugnant views tinge the work itself in subtle ways. Case in point: the very ways we <em>think about statistics</em> in validating scientific outcomes were <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/92/frontiers/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics">developed by eugenicists in pursuit of their need to justify racism</a>.</li><li>There are many, many articles written by concerned technologists trying to explain why cryptocurrencies and &#8220;web3&#8221; are a libertarian fever dream, wrapped in a lie, slathered with scam sauce and dusted with grift. <a href="https://tante.cc/2021/12/17/the-third-web/">This is a particularly comprehensive</a> one of them. (<a href="https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec">Here is another</a>)</li><li>Hillel Wayne: <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/the-outside-view/">The Outside View</a>. One of the best heuristics for quickly identifying charlatanry, and one we should be less embarrassed to employ.</li><li>Cory Doctorow: Turns out <a href="https://locusmag.com/2022/01/cory-doctorow-science-fiction-is-a-luddite-literature/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">we got the Luddites wrong</a>, all this time. Never thought I&#8217;d say this, but I guess I&#8217;m a Luddite.</li></ul>



<h2>What&#8217;s New</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s full steam ahead over at Graceful.Dev, the successor to RubyTapas and learn.avdi.codes. Here&#8217;s a few highlights since the last SIGAVDI:</p>



<ul><li>During the early pandemic lockdowns I quietly started writing a weird recursive book about project automation, and it&#8217;s now in alpha as a course-of-a-book on Graceful.Dev: <em><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/acapa/">A Course About Project Automation</a></em>. (If you were one of the pre-buyers of my <em>&#8220;Rake Field Manual&#8221;</em> project, this is the new incarnation. I&#8217;ll be sending out freebie codes for anyone who pre-purchased that book.)</li><li>In partnership with <a href="https://honeycomb.io">Honeycomb</a>, Jessica Kerr is building a new <em><a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/introduction-to-observability/">Introduction to Observability</a></em> course at Graceful.Dev! This one is free with registration, and if you jump in now your feedback can help guide the course&#8217;s evolution.  </li><li>I&#8217;ve been mostly focusing on site features, content organization, and kicking off some new courses like the ones above. But if you missed my one-off RubyTapas-era videos, I made a new one about <a href="https://graceful.dev/courses/tapastry/modules/2021/topic/lazy-greedy-regular-expressions/">laziness and greed in regular expressions</a>. </li><li>I can&#8217;t begin to summarize all the improvements I&#8217;ve made to Graceful.Dev over the past month-and-change, but that&#8217;s why the site has <a href="https://graceful.dev/blog/">its own blog</a>. One thing I&#8217;m particularly proud of: all the &#8220;lost&#8221; discussion threads from the old learn.avdi.codes Discourse-hosted forums are now resurrected on the site as either comments or forum posts!</li></ul>



<p>In non-Graceful.Dev news, my series of blog posts on running a &#8220;banana stand business&#8221; has continued, with entries on <a href="https://avdi.codes/the-pond-scum/" data-type="post" data-id="13003">The Pond Scum</a>, and <a href="https://avdi.codes/your-autoresponder/" data-type="post" data-id="13032">Your Autoresponder</a>.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s in my head</h2>



<p>I teased last time that I&#8217;d tell the story of my calamitous attempt to get a &#8220;real job&#8221;. I still don&#8217;t feel ready to unearth that tale. But maybe I can dig around the edges a little.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, when I saw a colleague take a job at an organization I knew to be ethically questionable, I&#8217;d scratch my head. Now I just start a mental countdown. Soon enough, they&#8217;ll be out with a plastered-on NDA smile and a carefully rehearsed line about an &#8220;exciting new chapter&#8221;.</p>



<p>Why do good people fall for bad organizations? Specifically, good senior people in tech, who have plenty of options? </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve often heard (and given) this bit of advice for interviewing: &#8220;Remember, you&#8217;re interviewing the company just as much as they are interviewing you.&#8221;</p>



<p>My experience with interviewing last year taught me that this advice is correct, but it&#8217;s not sufficient. Sure, yes, you&#8217;re interviewing the company. But it costs them nothing to give you the &#8220;right&#8221; answers. And it&#8217;s much easier for the people already there to <em>believe</em> those answers than to contemplate what it might mean if they didn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not enough to ask &#8220;hard questions&#8221;. If you have the privilege of options, and you really want to know what kind of organization you&#8217;re talking to, you have to take a step beyond questions.</p>



<p>You have to make yourself a tiny bit inconvenient.</p>



<p>I made myself inconvenient. Not wildly so. In my case all I did was ask for the things I&#8217;d been promised <em>to be put into writing</em>. That was it, but it was enough. I had gone off-script. I was no longer playing along with the tacit agreement: <em>we all want the same thing here.</em></p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I made myself inconvenient that I found out where I really stood.</p>



<p>Tech employment is a game where we all agree to be fooled into feeling powerful because we&#8217;re in-demand. Flexible hours! &#8220;Infinite&#8221; PTO! Shiny new hardware! Free lunch! <a href="https://twitter.com/HeyChelseaTroy/status/1476738341114720259">Leave your coffee cups wherever!</a> </p>



<p>In return for this safe, bright, <em>illusion</em> of power, we also agree to be systematically stripped of any true institutional leverage we might have had. It&#8217;s a cage, but it&#8217;s a <em>nice</em> cage, that you can easily pretend isn&#8217;t there. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-timnit-gebru-ai-what-really-happened/">Until you&#8217;re inconvenient</a>.</p>



<p>Front-loading the inconvenience to the interview point can save a lot of time, from this perspective. At the cost of sacrificing some comfortable illusions. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not so much about whether you <em>get</em> the inconvenient thing (unless it&#8217;s a dealbreaker for you, in which case, it is). It&#8217;s about understanding where the power lies. </p>



<p>Does the hiring manager tell you &#8220;yes, that should be totally doable&#8221;, then get countermanded?</p>



<p>Do you get offered handshake promises with no paper trail?</p>



<p>Do they counter-offer you more money instead? More money is cheap, in tech.</p>



<p>Do they interview you for your values, then balk at a specific ask that&#8217;s based on those values?</p>



<p>Do they tell you &#8220;sorry, but we have a standard procedure and we can&#8217;t make exceptions&#8221;? If so, you can forget &#8220;changing the org for the better&#8221; from within. Even if that&#8217;s what they said they were hiring you to do.</p>



<p>Do they simply ghost you? If so, I&#8217;m so sorry, but you were just a butt in a seat to them, no matter how &#8220;excited&#8221; they were to have &#8220;your unique skillset&#8221;. Probably better you found out this way.</p>



<p>The thing about inconvenience is that people like me can try it on like a loud Hawaiian shirt. </p>



<p>You know who else is &#8220;inconvenient&#8221; for the organization? People with disabilities, who may need accommodations in how the work is done in order to fully participate. People of color, who may have trouble focusing on work sometimes because another of their own was gunned down by police today. Mentally ill folks who don&#8217;t know when they will next wake up unable to get out of bed. Caregivers with schedule commitments that conflict with &#8220;core hours&#8221;. </p>



<p>And, of course, folks who just can&#8217;t seem to fold up their moral spines when they notice their shining giant aspirational best-of-the-best tech employer is <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/legal-medical-expenses-for-apple-whistleblower">breaking the law</a>. </p>



<p>Too much of the burden of being inconvenient falls on the folks with the least safety to bear it. I&#8217;m done with merely asking &#8220;tough questions&#8221;. I aim to be inconvenient. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>That&#8217;s enough for now. Stay warm (or cool, depending on hemisphere), stay safe, keep your socks dry, and make yourself inconvenient. And, oh yeah, if you like this newsletter, maybe <a href="https://t.co/0RzJPDgpun">drop me a buck a month</a>. You&#8217;ll get an invite to Jessitron and my Discord server, &#8220;Tensegrity&#8221; where you can chatter with us!</p>



<p>Cheers,</p>

Now it&#8217;s time to talk about the tech you use to manage your mailing list.</p>



<span id="more-13032"></span>



<h2>First, let&#8217;s make this concrete</h2>



<p>What I&#8217;m talking about in this article is a <em>huge</em> sector of products and services, of which you are most likely going to pick <em>one</em> and stick with it for a long time. To make this concrete, here are a few examples of what we&#8217;re talking about:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<ul><li>ActiveCampaign</li><li>Aweber</li><li>ConvertKit</li><li>Drip</li><li>Hubspot</li></ul>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<ul><li>InfusionSoft</li><li>MailChimp</li><li>Ontraport</li><li>Sendinblue</li></ul>



<p></p>
</div>
</div>



<p>These are just a few examples; there are many, many more such services. It&#8217;s a packed field. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll help you pick one by the end of this article.</p>



<h2>Second, let&#8217;s pick our terms</h2>



<p>Next we need to talk about terminology. The services you can pick from to manage and engage with your mailing list go by a lot of names:</p>



<ul><li>Customer Relations Management (CRM)</li><li>Email Marketing System (EMS)</li><li>Marketing Automation Platform</li></ul>



<p>None of these terms captures, by itself, the overlapping set of functionalities you&#8217;re going to use for your banana stand business. At the same time, even all together, they don&#8217;t really express what this system is going to <em>mean</em> to your business.</p>



<p>If we were to pick a brand new word for this service, we might call it a <em><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/tech-science/parasocial-relationship/">Parasocial</a> Engagement Engine</em>. It&#8217;s a tool that enables you to scale your relationship with your community beyond the number of relationships a single human brain can keep track of. It&#8217;s an adjunct brain for engaging with your growing audience. </p>



<p>It also a term that no one else will recognize, and it makes for an unfortunate acronym (PEE). Let&#8217;s choose something else.</p>



<p>Grizzled old marketers often make reference your <em>autoresponder</em>. &#8220;Autoresponder&#8221; is an anachronistic term stemming from the early age of mailing list software. It&#8217;s from the days when a mailing list manager was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">cgi-bin</a> script that people could send an email to, and it would &#8220;auto-respond&#8221; with some options for opting-in to mailings.</p>



<p>I like the term &#8220;autoresponder&#8221; because it is so <em>completely</em> inaccurate that it can safely stand in for <em>all</em> the overlapping sets of functions that a parasocial engagement engine encompasses. And it&#8217;s also a recognized term of art. I&#8217;m going to use the term &#8220;autoresponder&#8221; from here on out.</p>



<h2>Why it matters</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve talked about how <a href="https://avdi.codes/your-mailing-list/" data-type="post" data-id="12911">your mailing list is the lifeblood of your business</a>. Your autoresponder is what manages your mailing list.</p>



<p>Sure, your <em>product</em> is books or videos or courses or workshops. And you might use a storefront to sell those products. You might deliver them with a Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress, or a Learning Management System (LMS) like Podia or Kajabi.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have a business without a product. <em>But your product is not your business. </em>If there&#8217;s one thing you take away from this article, let it be this: <strong>your autoresponder is the operational backbone of your business.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Your autoresponder is the means by which you build your audience.</li><li>It may not be how you currently publish <a href="https://avdi.codes/a-pattern-language-of-banana-stands-your-newsletter/">newsletters</a>, but if not it probably will be eventually.</li><li>It&#8217;s how you <em>build trust</em> with that audience, via your newsletters, free email courses, etc. </li><li>It&#8217;s how you communicate with your biggest fans. </li><li>It&#8217;s how you identify who might be interested in a particular topic&#8230; and who would just be annoyed by emails on that topic.</li><li>It&#8217;s how you let your audience know when you have a new product available. </li><li>It&#8217;s how reach out for feedback to guide your product planning. </li><li>It&#8217;s the source of one-to-one conversations that may inspire <em>new</em> products.</li><li>It&#8217;s how you solicit testimonials. </li><li>It&#8217;s your most important source of analytics. </li><li>It hosts the automations that will ensure your customers receive the products they are entitled to.</li><li>It hosts the automations that will keep up with your customers ways you don&#8217;t have bandwidth for. E.g. notice a customer has purchased a product but never accessed it, and reach out to them to check if they ran into problems.</li><li>It can be the consistent source of truth for who-has-bought-what, even as you migrate from one storefront platform to another.</li><li>When integrated with your other services, it can be a huge aid to customer support, because it can give you a unified view of all of a customer&#8217;s past interactions with your business.</li></ul>



<p>Your autoresponder is <em>the team you don&#8217;t have</em>. If your business was a car, it would be the chassis. If your business were a band, it would be the rhythm section. Other tools and services will come and go, and your autoresponder will outlive them all.</p>



<h2>Integrations matter</h2>



<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ve convinced you by now of how important your autoresponder is. It is also the service that tends to change less often than checkout systems, CMSes, etc. Migrating from one autoresponder to another is a huge hassle. For this one element of your business, there&#8217;s a lot of value in continuity. </p>



<p>So where in most cases my advice tends to be &#8220;just pick <em>something</em> and start&#8221;, in this one case it makes sense to spend a little more time and effort on research.</p>



<p>Your autoresponder sits in the center of the web of services that power your business. As such, the most important consideration for picking an autoresponder is not the tool itself, but what it integrates with.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not talking about the absolute number of supported integrations, either. I&#8217;m talking about its integrations with <em>the kinds of other tools and services that a banana stand business needs</em>. That is, services that support indie creators, as opposed to the services that cater to enterprise behemoths.</p>



<p>At the extreme end of integration, some content or store platforms offer a <em>built-in</em> autoresponder, of sorts. For instance, if you have a <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> store, people can subscribe to your store without buying a product. And you can email those people. This is a rudimentary autoresponder.</p>



<p>It can be tempting to lean on this kind of all-in-one platform when you&#8217;re getting started. And it might be OK for the first ~year, so long as the integrated autoresponder offers CSV export for migration.</p>



<p>But if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned about this product category, it&#8217;s that you want to be able to evolve your other services <em>around</em> your autoresponder. You don&#8217;t want it to tie you to any particular toolset. So I recommend picking a standalone service.</p>



<h2>Choosing your autoresponder</h2>



<p>Like I said earlier, there are a <em>lot</em> of services in this space to choose from. Many of them are &#8220;good enough&#8221;. </p>



<p>But rather than equivocate, I&#8217;m going to give you two concrete informed recommendations. As of 2021:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a></strong> is laser-focused on the indie creator community, has the essential autoresponder features, offers rudimentary store/subscription features as well, and integrates with most of the services you are likely to care about.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/">ActiveCampaign</a></strong> is industrial-strength, will scale with you as far as you care to go, has fancier automation features, and integrates with everything under the sun. It is also <a href="https://wpfusion.com/reviews/best-crms-for-wordpress/">WP Fusion&#8217;s top recommendation</a> for 2021, and the WP Fusion folks know their shit. </li></ul>



<p>Disclaimers: I am not affiliated with any of these services. I do not get referral fees. I have recommended ConvertKit to a few people and they report being happy with it. I have not used ActiveCampaign, but I&#8217;ve read a lot of good things about it, and I have noted that every service I care about integrates with it.</p>



<p>Personally, as of this writing I am still using <a href="https://www.drip.com/">Drip</a>. If I could snap my fingers and migrate all my data and automations without a hiccup, I&#8217;d probably switch to ActiveCampaign. But Drip is still Good Enough for my purposes that the friction of migration isn&#8217;t worth it to me. Remember what I said earlier: when it comes to your autoresponder, there&#8217;s value in continuity. </p>



<h2>Next steps</h2>



<p>OK, you picked an autoresponder and signed up. Now what?</p>



<p>This article is about as long as I want it to be, and I&#8217;ll have a lot to say about specific use-cases for your autoresponder in future posts. But for right now:</p>



<ol><li>If you have customers already, or already have a newsletter, make sure you import those email addresses into your autoresponder. Play with tagging them meaningfully (e.g. <code>Newsletter Subscriber</code>, <code>Kubernetes Book Buyer</code>)</li><li>If you don&#8217;t already have a newsletter, use the autoresponder to create a <a href="https://avdi.codes/your-newsletter/" data-type="post" data-id="12927">newsletter</a> sign-up form and embed it on your blog.</li><li>Create your first drip email course! All modern autoresponders support this feature, and it&#8217;s a great way to build your relationships with your audience. Put a signup for the email course on your blog, or social media profile, etc.</li></ol>



<p>Congratulations, your business now has a spinal column. Cheers!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the aspects of Ruby that often confuses newbies coming from other languages is the fact that it has both&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>raise</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>rescue</code>&nbsp;statements. In this article I’ll try and clear up that confusion.</p>



<span id="more-13020"></span>



<p>If you’re familiar with Java, C#, PHP, or C++, you are probably used to using&nbsp;<code>try</code>,&nbsp;<code>catch</code>, and&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;for exception handling. You use&nbsp;<code>try</code>&nbsp;to delineate the block in which you expect an exception may occur. You use&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;to specify what to do when an exception is raised. And you use&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;to raise an exception yourself.</p>



<p>You’ve probably noticed that Ruby has&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>catch</code>… but they don’t seem to be used the way you’re used to in other languages! And there are also these “<code>begin</code>“, “<code>raise</code>” and “<code>rescue</code>” statements that seem to do the same thing. What’s going on here?</p>



<h3>Getting out fast</h3>



<p>If you’ve done much programming in another language like Java, you may have noticed that exceptions are sometimes used for non-error situations. “exceptions for control flow” is a technique developers sometimes turn to when they want an “early escape” from a particular path of execution.</p>



<p>For instance, imagine some code that scrapes a series of web pages, looking for one that contains a particular text string.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>def show_rank_for(target, query)
  rank = nil
  each_google_result_page(query, 6) do |page, page_index|
    each_google_result(page) do |result, result_index|
      if result.text.include?(target)
        rank = (page_index * 10) + result_index
      end
    end
  end
  puts &quot;#{target} is ranked #{rank} for search &#039;#{query}&#039;&quot;
end

show_rank_for(&quot;avdi.org&quot;, &quot;nonesuch&quot;)</code></pre>



<p>(For brevity, I’ve excluded the definitions of the&nbsp;<code>#each_google_result_page</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>#each_google_result</code>&nbsp;methods. You can view the full source at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210527155201/https://gist.github.com/1075364">https://gist.github.com/1075364</a>.)</p>



<p>Fetching pages and parsing them is time-consuming. What if the target text is found on page 2? This code will keep right on going until it hits the max number of result pages (here specified as 6).</p>



<p>It would be nice if we could end the search as soon as we find a matching result. We might think to use the&nbsp;<code>break</code>&nbsp;keyword, which “breaks out” of a loop’s execution. But&nbsp;<code>break</code>&nbsp;only breaks out of the immediately surrounding loop, and here we have a loop inside another loop.</p>



<p>This is a situation where we might come up with the idea of using an exception to break out of the two levels of looping. But exceptions are supposed to be for unexpected failures, and finding the results we were looking for is neither unexpected, nor a failure! What to do?</p>



<h3>Throwing Ruby a fast ball</h3>



<p>Ruby has given us a tool for just this situation. Unlike in other languages, Ruby’s&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;are not used for exceptions. Instead, they provide a way to terminate execution early when no further work is needed. Their behavior is very similar to that of exceptions, but they are intended for very different situations.</p>



<p>Let’s look at how we can use&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;to end the web search as soon as we find a result:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>def show_rank_for(target, query)
  rank = catch(:rank) {
    each_google_result_page(query, 6) do |page, page_index|
      each_google_result(page) do |result, result_index|
        if result.text.include?(target)
          throw :rank, (page_index * 10) + result_index
        end
      end
    end
    &quot;&lt;not found&gt;&quot;
  }
  puts &quot;#{target} is ranked #{rank} for search &#039;#{query}&#039;&quot;
end</code></pre>



<p>This time we’ve wrapped the whole search in a&nbsp;<code>catch{...}</code>&nbsp;block. We tell the&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;block what symbol to catch, in this case&nbsp;<code>:rank</code>. When the result we are looking for is found, instead of setting a variable we throw the symbol&nbsp;<code>:rank</code>. We also give&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;a second parameter, the search result&nbsp;<code>:rank</code>. This second parameter is the throw’s “payload”.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;“throws” execution up to the&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;block, breaking out of all the intervening blocks and method calls. Because we gave the&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;the same symbol (<code>:rank</code>), the&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;block is matched to the&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;and the thrown symbol is “caught”.</p>



<p>The rank value that we gave as a payload to throw now becomes the return value of the&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;block. We assign the result value to a variable, and proceed normally.</p>



<p>What if the search string is never found, and <code>throw</code> is never called? In that case, the loops will finish, and the return value of the <code>catch</code> block will be the value of the last statement in the block. We provide a default value (<code>&quot;&lt;not found&gt;&quot;</code>) for just this possibility.</p>



<h3>catch and throw in the real world</h3>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210527155201/http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210527155201/http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>&nbsp;projects provide a great example of how&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;can be used to terminate execution early. Sinatra’s&nbsp;<code>#last_modified</code>&nbsp;method looks at the HTTP headers supplied by the client and, if they indicate the client already has the most recent version of the page, immediately ends the action and returns a “Not modified” code. Any expensive processing that would have been incurred by executing the full action is avoided.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">get '/foo' do
  last_modified some_timestamp
  # ...expensive GET logic...
end</pre>



<p>Here’s a simplified version of the&nbsp;<code>#last_modified</code>&nbsp;implementation. Note that it throws the&nbsp;<code>:halt</code>&nbsp;symbol. Rack catches this symbol, and uses the supplied response to immediately reply to the HTTP client. This works no matter how many levels deep in method calls the&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;was invoked.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>def last_modified(time)
  response&#091;&#039;Last-Modified&#039;] = time
  if request.env&#091;&#039;HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE&#039;] &gt; time
    throw :halt, response
  end
end</code></pre>



<p>The way Rack uses&nbsp;<code>catch/throw</code>&nbsp;illustrates an important point: the&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;call does not have to be in the same method as the&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;block.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Ruby is a language that tries to anticipate your needs as a programmer. One common need is a way to terminate execution early when we find there is no further work to be done. Unlike in some languages, where we would have to either abuse the exception mechanism or use multiple loop breaks and method returns to achieve the same effect, Ruby provides us with the&nbsp;<code>catch</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>throw</code>&nbsp;mechanism to quickly and cleanly make an early escape. This leaves&nbsp;<code>begin/raise/rescue</code>&nbsp;free to be used for errors, and nothing else.</p>

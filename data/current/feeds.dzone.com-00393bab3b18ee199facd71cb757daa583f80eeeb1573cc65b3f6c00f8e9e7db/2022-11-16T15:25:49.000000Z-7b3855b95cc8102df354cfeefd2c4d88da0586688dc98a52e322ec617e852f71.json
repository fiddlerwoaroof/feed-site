With every day leading humans to a more developed and connected world, these data centers are becoming focal points of the sustainability conversation for the tech sector. One of the top solutions experts present is modular data centers. These centers seek to optimize operations and energy <a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/iot-and-the-environment-a-greener-world\">efficiency for a greener future</a>, but is the effort to make the shift worth it?</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Different Are Modular Data Centers?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Data centers are responsible for <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks\">1% of the world’s electricity</a> demand. Though this doesn’t seem like a large number, it will only increase as technological needs increase. That translates to around 200 TWh of electricity, most of which runs on fossil fuels and isn’t optimized for current internet activity.</p>"

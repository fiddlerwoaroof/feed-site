  "content":"<p>Apache Kafka became the de facto standard for processing data in motion across enterprises and industries. Cybersecurity is a key success factor across all use cases. <strong>Kafka</strong> is not just used as a backbone and source of truth for data. It also <strong>monitors, correlates, and proactively acts on events from various real-time and batch data sources to detect anomalies and respond to incidents</strong>. This blog series explores use cases and architectures for Kafka in the cybersecurity space, including situational awareness, threat intelligence, forensics, air-gapped and zero trust environments, and SIEM/SOAR modernization. <strong>This post is part two: Cyber Situational Awareness</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Blog Series: Apache Kafka for Cybersecurity</h3>\n<p>This blog series explores why security features such as RBAC, encryption, and audit logs are only the foundation of a secure event streaming infrastructure. Learn about <strong>use cases,  architectures, and reference deployments for Kafka in the cybersecurity space</strong>:</p>"

  "content":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/token-based-security-oauth-20-oidc-and-identityser\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous post</a>, we learned that OAuth is an <strong>authorization framework</strong> specially built for <strong>HTTP APIs</strong>. It allows a user to securely delegate <strong>scoped API Access</strong> to an application.</p>\n<p>By scoped access means, that users define exactly what parts of an API they want the application to be allowed to use. This application can then talk to API freely on the user's behalf. In simple words, OAuth is a delegation protocol.</p>"

  "content":"<p>Due to their lightweight, portable nature, using containers allows optimal cloud-native application builds. Now, running ten containers is relatively straightforward, but when you consider running containers at scale - hundreds and thousands of containers comprising hundreds of services, for example -  this can get out of hand quickly. </p>\n<p>At this point, enterprises reach for a service or tool that can handle this challenge, which is where container orchestration tools come into the picture. Since 2014, AWS has launched more than <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/containers/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">50 new features and multiple services</a> to help engineers run containers in the cloud. At first, these tools aimed at optimizing how to run containers. The evolution of that tech has moved towards granular management and orchestration of container workloads. </p>"

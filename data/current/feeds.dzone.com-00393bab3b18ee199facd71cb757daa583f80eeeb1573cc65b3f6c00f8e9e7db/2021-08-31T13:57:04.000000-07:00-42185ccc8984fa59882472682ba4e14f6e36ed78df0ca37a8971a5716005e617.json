  "content":"<p>There are various methods available to simulate the network conditions like throttle network traffic using browser DevTools Network Throttle feature, Publicly available APIs which respond with delay, and using a Browser Extension to redirect your actual request to those Public APIs, and Chrome Extension which adds actual delays to the network requests.</p>\n<p>As a frontend developer or QA, we want to test our website performance in different network conditions and with different API latencies too. Testing certain components of web applications requires simulating delay in one or more web app components.</p>"

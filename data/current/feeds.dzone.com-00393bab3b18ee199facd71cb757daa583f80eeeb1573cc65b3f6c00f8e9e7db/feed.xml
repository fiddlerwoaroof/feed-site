      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-effectively-perform-white-box-testing</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>White box testing is a type of testing technique that aims to evaluate the code, design, and internal structure of a program to improve its design, usability, and security. It is one of the two parts of Box Testing methodologies included in software QA testing.</p>
<p>The term “white box” is used to refer to the concept of the see-through box. Simply put, the clear box or White Box symbolizes the ability to look through the outer shell of a program and into its inner layout.</p>]]></description>

      <title>A Guide To REST API Testing Strategy</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/a-guide-to-rest-api-testing-strategy</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Recent studies on customer experience by Zendesk reveal that one bad customer service experience leads to 39% of customers ignoring a company for the next two years. To avoid such incidents, you should shape up your user interface (UI) interactions effectively to engage with the prospects and constantly add value to their interactions with the content on your website. It’s one of the fastest, most convenient ways to prevent massive losses and boost your profits.</p>
<p>Creating an excellent UI is not possible without an Application Program Interface (API) - the intermediary that bridges gaps between programs. One type of API called Representational State Transfer (REST) API can transform businesses of any size or industry by addressing the needs of both companies and consumers. Read on to learn how to use REST API to achieve new heights.</p>]]></description>

      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/the-dogmatic-scrum-master-anti-pattern</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>TL; DR: The Dogmatic Scrum Master Anti-Pattern</h2>
<p>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Since Scrum is an intentionally incomplete framework with a reasonable yet short "manual," this effect should not surprise anyone. For example, how do we communicate with members of the Scrum team that take the Scrum Guide literally? What about a dogmatic Scrum Master?</p>
<p>Join me and delve into the effects of Scrum dogmatism in less than 120 seconds.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Apache Kafka in Cybersecurity for Situational Awareness in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/apache-kafka-in-cybersecurity-for-situational-awareness</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Apache Kafka became the de facto standard for processing data in motion across enterprises and industries. Cybersecurity is a key success factor across all use cases. <strong>Kafka</strong> is not just used as a backbone and source of truth for data. It also <strong>monitors, correlates, and proactively acts on events from various real-time and batch data sources to detect anomalies and respond to incidents</strong>. This blog series explores use cases and architectures for Kafka in the cybersecurity space, including situational awareness, threat intelligence, forensics, air-gapped and zero trust environments, and SIEM/SOAR modernization. <strong>This post is part two: Cyber Situational Awareness</strong>.</p>
<h3>Blog Series: Apache Kafka for Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>This blog series explores why security features such as RBAC, encryption, and audit logs are only the foundation of a secure event streaming infrastructure. Learn about <strong>use cases, &nbsp;architectures, and reference deployments for Kafka in the cybersecurity space</strong>:</p>]]></description>

 <h2>Intro</h2>
 <p>This is a multi-part series introducing how we can use Kafka, Postgres, and Debezium to stream data stored in a relational database into Kafka. If you haven't read the first part of this series, you may do so <a href="https://arctype.com/blog/kafka-tutorial/1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
 <p>At the end of Part 1, we successfully demonstrated inserting a record into one of our tables and watching it stream into a Kafka topic. Now that we have the basics of data streaming set up, it's time to write a Kafka Streams app to do some custom data processing.</p>]]></description>

      <title>How to Prepare for a Large Workshop</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-prepare-for-a-large-workshop</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It can be stressful to prepare for a large workshop, there is just so much to think about!</p>
<p>For years, I've been using variations of this checklist to guide how I prepare for large workshops. It goes without saying that context is everything and that no two workshops are the same — some of these items might make sense in your situations, others might not, but it could still be useful to have a somewhat comprehensive view of the work that needs to take place to prepare for <em>most</em> workshops.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Token-Based Security, OAuth 2.0, OIDC and IdentityServer4: Part 2</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/token-based-security-oauth-20-oidc-identityserver4-part-2</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/token-based-security-oauth-20-oidc-and-identityser" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous post</a>, we learned that OAuth is an <strong>authorization framework</strong> specially built for <strong>HTTP APIs</strong>. It allows a user to securely delegate <strong>scoped API Access</strong> to an application.</p>
<p>By scoped access means, that users define exactly what parts of an API they want the application to be allowed to use. This application can then talk to API freely on the user's behalf. In simple words, OAuth is a delegation protocol.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Nextcloud and Kubernetes in the Cloud With Kuma Service Mesh</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/powering-kubernetes-in-the-cloud-with-kuma-service-1</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently decided I wanted to start cutting third-party cloud services out of my life. I purchased a shiny <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 400</a> (which reminded me of the Amiga computers of my youth) and decided to try <a href="https://nextcloud.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a> on it as a personal cloud. It was a far quicker process than I expected thanks to the awesome <a href="http://nextcloudpi.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NextCloudPi</a> project. Within twenty minutes, I had a running Nextcloud instance. However, I could only access it locally on my internal network, and accessing it externally is complicated if you don’t have a static IP address, or use dynamic DNS on a router that supports it.</p>
<p>There are of course myriad ways to solve these problems (and NextCloudPi offers convenient solutions to many of them), but I was also interested in how Kubernetes might handle some of the work for me. Of course, this can mean I am using cloud providers of a different kind, but I would have portability, and with a combination of an Ingress and Service Mesh, could move my hosting around as I wanted.</p>]]></description>

      <title>PostgreSQL Transactions and How To Use Them</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/postgresql-transactions-and-how-to-use-them</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this article, we’ll answer all of those questions and more to help you get started with PostgreSQL transactions and implementation.</p>
<h2>What Are Transactions?</h2>
<p>Simply put, transactions are propagations to any change in the database. Let's say that you added a new element to the database—that’s an example of a transaction. A transaction need not just be a single change, rather, it can contain one or more operations. In real-world applications, transactions are usually a combination of various database operations.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Using RxJava and Kotlin to Assemble an Android App</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/using-rxjava-and-kotlin-to-assemble-an-android-app</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Advanced portable applications accomplish a great deal. They convey information between various back-ends through network APIs. They store and recover information from the local database, process substantial amounts of media, and communicate with web sockets. It's difficult to monitor all the data from various asynchronous data sources, particularly realizing that the users are used to a simple, fluid user experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the beginning of Android, designers utilized the class&nbsp;AsyncTask&nbsp;from the Android system to accomplish everything outside the primary UI thread. Although async tasks did what they should, utilizing them wasn't the most charming experience in light of all the standard code you would eventually end up writing due to adaptability issues. If you had a further developed use case (i.e., introducing information from a neighborhood data set on the UI while making an API solicitation to get the most recent information from the backend, refreshing the nearby data set, and introducing the most recent information on the UI), things would quickly spiral. You would wind up with code that is difficult to comprehend and keep up with.</p>]]></description>

      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/soft-deletion-in-hibernate-things-you-may-miss</link>

 <div data-v-7f868b5f=""> 
  <p>Soft Deletion is a commonly used pattern in enterprise applications. Hibernate is a widely used persistence framework in the Java ecosystem. Therefore, it is not surprising that Hibernate provides a way to implement soft deletion. However, this approach has some awkward aspects, which are not highlighted by the docs and articles on that matter. In this article, we will dive into some details that you may miss.</p> 
  <h3>@SQLDelete + @Where</h3> 
  <p>If you Google 'soft deletion hibernate,' you’ll most likely find tutorials by <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-jpa-soft-delete" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eugen Paraschiv</a>, <a href="https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-soft-delete-with-hibernate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vlad Mihalcea</a>, or <a href="https://thorben-janssen.com/implement-soft-delete-hibernate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thorben Janssen</a>. They suggest using Hibernate <code>@SQLDelete</code> and <code>@Where</code> annotations which let you automatically set the <code>deleted</code> flag and filter by it:</p>]]></description>

      <title>How to Test Your Application in Different Network Conditions by Simulating Artificial Delays in Network Requests</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-test-your-application-in-different-network-7</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are various methods available to simulate the network conditions like throttle network traffic using browser DevTools Network Throttle feature, Publicly available APIs which respond with delay, and using a Browser Extension to redirect your actual request to those Public APIs, and Chrome Extension which adds actual delays to the network requests.</p>
<p>As a frontend developer or QA, we want to test our website performance in different network conditions and with different API latencies too. Testing certain components of web applications requires simulating delay in one or more web app components.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Introduction to Ansible</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-ansible</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div itemprop="articleBody">
 <p>I’ve worked in IT for a long time, and my secret collection of shell and Python scripts has made a lot that works easier. I remember having a repository full of scripts to install this, automate that… you get the idea. Some of these have been my pride and joy, full of witty remarks, inside jokes, and pop culture references. And I’ve handed these down to teams that succeeded me with pride. But these DIY Adhoc scripts don’t scale well, and often cause more trouble than they’re worth.</p>
 <p>Ansible is the tool to solve these problems. It’s a collection of several (hundred?) modules to do most of what you can imagine doing as a sysadmin/troubleshooter. You can assemble these modules into Playbooks and use them for Adhoc maintenance or reliable production use-cases. Say you need to set up a new Linux machine with Apache installed. In bash, you would write the installation commands one by one. But in Ansible, you can create a task for what you want and let Ansible take care of the rest. That’s the key difference: moving from <strong>how</strong> to <strong>what</strong>. With Ansible, you define the final state of your system and Ansible manages the execution - this is the difference between <strong>declarative</strong> and <strong>imperative</strong>.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Software Project Misconceptions: More People Will Finish Sooner</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/software-project-misconceptions-more-people-will-f</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">More hands will finish sooner. This is common sense that has been applied successfully in many human endeavors, throughout centuries, industries, and civilizations. A practice so popular that can easily result in a misconception due to hidden assumptions, oversimplification, and bias. Employing more people to finish your software project sooner is not always a good idea. Writing code can be a more complex and complicated activity than simple procedural and repetitive work. Using a large employee expansion as a strategy to solve your software project's problems is like testing only a single happy path for a use case with many negative tests and edge cases.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Software Code as a Medium</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Software code is a tractable medium. From simple ideas, we can build concepts like objects, interfaces, and behavior into flexible representations of complete systems. Although it's reasonable to assume that this medium tractability will lead to fewer difficulties, coding introduces its own difficulties. Conceptually involved ideas with problematically complex implementation, especially under scaled codebases (e.g., millions of lines of code) require creativity, skills, quality, training, communication, and coordination among employees.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

      <title>Taming the Moose: Method Modifiers Instead of Overrides in Object-Oriented Perl</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/taming-the-moose-method-modifiers-instead-of-overr</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div>
 <p>Last month <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/07/13/taming-the-moose-picking-the-best-way-to-subclass-perl-methods/">I wrote about using Moose's <code>override</code> function</a> to, well, override a superclass's method. <a href="https://chris.prather.org/">Chris Prather</a> on the <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.perl.org/moose">#moose IRC channel</a> suggested soon after that the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Moose/view/lib/Moose/Manual/MethodModifiers.pod#Around-modifiers"><code>around</code> method modifier</a> (or its little sisters <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Moose/view/lib/Moose/Manual/MethodModifiers.pod#Before-and-after-Modifiers"><code>before</code> and <code>after</code></a>) might be a better choice if you're also calling the original method inside. He noted that "at a minimum <code>override</code> only works if you're subclassing, <code>around</code> will apply to composing methods too."</p>
 <p>His point was that when you decide to compose <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose::Manual::Roles">roles</a> (also know as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)">traits</a>) instead of or in addition to more traditional inheritance, <code>override</code> simply doesn't work: only a method modifier will do. (And as <a href="https://haarg.org/">Graham Knop</a> and <a href="https://github.com/karenetheridge">Karen Etheridge</a> later remarked on IRC, <code>override</code> isn't even an option if you're using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo">Moo</a> as an alternative to Moose.)</p>]]></description>

      <title>Containers on AWS: Which Service Is Right for Your Workload</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/containers-on-aws-which-service-is-right-for-your</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Due to their lightweight, portable nature, using containers allows optimal cloud-native application builds. Now, running ten containers is relatively straightforward, but when you consider running containers at scale - hundreds and thousands of containers comprising hundreds of services, for example - &nbsp;this can get out of hand quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, enterprises reach for a service or tool that can handle this challenge, which is where container orchestration tools come into the picture. Since 2014, AWS has launched more than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/containers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">50 new features and multiple services</a> to help engineers run containers in the cloud. At first, these tools aimed at optimizing how to run containers. The evolution of that tech has moved towards granular management and orchestration of container workloads.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

To enable the <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/10-best-practices-for-data-migration" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smooth migration of data&nbsp;</a>between myriad data sources and deliver value, organizations must employ effective data transformation strategies for better insight delivery and ultimately decision-making. This is easier said than done, however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data has multiple formats, languages, and schemas, and analyzing this highly complex data to extract insights and make decisions is challenging. For this, organizations need to integrate all the data sources – and thus all the data. Data mapping has a huge role to play here.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps vs. Agile: What’s Right for Your Team?</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/devops-vs-agile-whats-right-for-your-team</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are two primary software development methodologies these days: Agile and DevOps. Research from <a href="https://circle.gartner.com/Portals/2/Resources/pdf/Agile%20in%20the%20Enterprise%202019%20-%20Results%20Summary%20(updated).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gartner</a> has found that 70% of IT teams use DevOps<strong>.</strong> Has DevOps totally usurped its predecessor, then? Or can developers use both methodologies for rapid time to market and problem-free deployment? It helps to first examine the primary difference between the two.</p>
<p>The goal of Agile is to make sure the dev team and its processes have the agility to make quick changes. Whereas DevOps prizes end-to-end business solutions, enabling collaboration between the development and operations teams to increase the speed of work in both stages. Both approaches speed up the deployment pipeline but in different ways. So, this brings up the question: which is better?&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

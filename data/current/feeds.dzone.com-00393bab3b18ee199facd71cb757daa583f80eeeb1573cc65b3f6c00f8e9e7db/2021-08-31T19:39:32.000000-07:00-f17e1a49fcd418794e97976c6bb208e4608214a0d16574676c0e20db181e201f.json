  "content":"<div>\n <h2><img class=\"fr-fic fr-dib lazyload\" alt=\"Streaming Data With Postgres + Kafka + Debezium: Part 2\"></h2>\n <h2>Intro</h2>\n <p>This is a multi-part series introducing how we can use Kafka, Postgres, and Debezium to stream data stored in a relational database into Kafka. If you haven't read the first part of this series, you may do so <a href=\"https://arctype.com/blog/kafka-tutorial/1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n <p>At the end of Part 1, we successfully demonstrated inserting a record into one of our tables and watching it stream into a Kafka topic. Now that we have the basics of data streaming set up, it's time to write a Kafka Streams app to do some custom data processing.</p></div>"

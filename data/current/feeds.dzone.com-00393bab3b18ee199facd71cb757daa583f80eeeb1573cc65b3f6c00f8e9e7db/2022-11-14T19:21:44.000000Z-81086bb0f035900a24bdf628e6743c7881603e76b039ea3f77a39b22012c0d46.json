  "content":"<p>When migrating SQL Server from on-premises to the cloud, there is always an ask about how to migrate SSIS packages or other ETL jobs to the cloud. Azure Data Factory SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) offers to run SSIS packages in the cloud.</p>\n<p>However, in certain circumstances, those ETL jobs or SSIS packages run executables such as .EXE as a part of a workflow or ETL pipelines. It becomes more challenging if you are migrating SQL Server running on-premises to PaaS as there is no access to PaaS compute to run those executables.</p>"

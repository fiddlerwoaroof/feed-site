  "content":"<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is a Computer Vision Model?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Computer vision (CV) is a field within artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) that involves computer programs interpreting the meaning of image and video inputs. A computer vision algorithm can analyze specific criteria in visual data and use its interpretations to implement predictive and decision-making tasks.</p>\n<p>Modern computer vision models are highly sophisticated and cover many use cases to automate critical decision-making systems and enhance business efficiency. As a type of machine learning algorithm, computer vision models are challenging to deploy.</p>"

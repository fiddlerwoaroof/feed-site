  "content":"<p>There are two primary software development methodologies these days: Agile and DevOps. Research from <a href=\"https://circle.gartner.com/Portals/2/Resources/pdf/Agile%20in%20the%20Enterprise%202019%20-%20Results%20Summary%20(updated).pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gartner</a> has found that 70% of IT teams use DevOps<strong>.</strong> Has DevOps totally usurped its predecessor, then? Or can developers use both methodologies for rapid time to market and problem-free deployment? It helps to first examine the primary difference between the two.</p>\n<p>The goal of Agile is to make sure the dev team and its processes have the agility to make quick changes. Whereas DevOps prizes end-to-end business solutions, enabling collaboration between the development and operations teams to increase the speed of work in both stages. Both approaches speed up the deployment pipeline but in different ways. So, this brings up the question: which is better? </p>"

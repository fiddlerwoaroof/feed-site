  "content":"<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More hands will finish sooner. This is common sense that has been applied successfully in many human endeavors, throughout centuries, industries, and civilizations. A practice so popular that can easily result in a misconception due to hidden assumptions, oversimplification, and bias. Employing more people to finish your software project sooner is not always a good idea. Writing code can be a more complex and complicated activity than simple procedural and repetitive work. Using a large employee expansion as a strategy to solve your software project's problems is like testing only a single happy path for a use case with many negative tests and edge cases.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Software Code as a Medium</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Software code is a tractable medium. From simple ideas, we can build concepts like objects, interfaces, and behavior into flexible representations of complete systems. Although it's reasonable to assume that this medium tractability will lead to fewer difficulties, coding introduces its own difficulties. Conceptually involved ideas with problematically complex implementation, especially under scaled codebases (e.g., millions of lines of code) require creativity, skills, quality, training, communication, and coordination among employees. </p>"

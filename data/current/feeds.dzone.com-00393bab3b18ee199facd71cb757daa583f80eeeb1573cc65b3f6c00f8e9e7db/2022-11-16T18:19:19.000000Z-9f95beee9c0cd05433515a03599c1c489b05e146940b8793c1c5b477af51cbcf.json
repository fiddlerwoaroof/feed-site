This is a very well-organized community event focused on all things in the open-source Prometheus project, including, for example, PromQL and PromLens.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4_Xoac-OzJ-jDj_J3TboAC_R52LKfhFc8T5DFtpEYNLST4-EuAircIrcSnJcjl0RzS74V8aLMF39LhCcigwKifQSeDcXZGSSI0dNEXNhYGwk6QERwHI2IhX8Uj8MXfEqx94eiARh_m9lqHQXcRwO-LD2Uax4pn5gZrOw5yHc6EQHON-Un9PBW0bd8/s790/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-06%20at%2021.15.43.png\"><img class=\"fr-fic fr-dib lazyload\" alt=\"PromCon EU 2022\"></a>This article will be a bit of an overview, rather than a review of each specific talk, covering what I saw and found interesting between the common discussions and chatting that happens between talks in the hallways. Often these overlapping session starting times prohibit one from seeing everything at a conference.</p></div>"

It contains an example of how to use <a href=\"https://tekton.dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tekton</a> to create a CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys an <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/containers_cd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Connect Enterprise</a> application to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Hat OpenShift</a>.</p>\n<p>The pipeline uses the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/containers_cd?topic=operator-from-openshift-web-console\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM App Connect Operator</a> to easily build, deploy and manage your applications in containers. The pipeline runs on OpenShift to allow it to easily be integrated into an automated <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/deliver/practice_continuous_delivery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">continuous delivery workflow</a> without needing to build anything locally from a developer's workstation.</p>"

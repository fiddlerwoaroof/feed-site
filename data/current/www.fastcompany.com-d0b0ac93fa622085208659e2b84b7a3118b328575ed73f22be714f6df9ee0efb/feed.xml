            <description><![CDATA[<p>In an interview with Hannah Beachler, the production designer explains how she realized a space for her characters and audience to grieve.</p>

<p>A column of red-gold flames bounds across the floor and up the wall of the Wakandan throne room. Amber light obtrudes the iridescent purple hues of land of the Wakandan Ancestors as radiating flames engulf the space. The source of these flames is Princess Shuri&#x2019;s rage in her grief.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A more sustainable approach to air conditioning, inspired by frog skin.</p>

<p>For all the reasons workers might hate their offices, air-conditioning ranks highly. One study found that 60% of workers reported thermal stress in their too-cold workplaces, and thermostats have long been set down low for the long-gone age of offices being stuffed with men in three-piece-suits. Offices are often too cold, particularly for women, and everybody&#x2019;s productivity suffers.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

<p>You&#x2019;d be forgiven for mistaking Adam Frisch for a Republican. The former Aspen city council member who is running against Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) in Colorado&#x2019;s 3rd district (as of publication, trailing Bobert by approximately 1,000 votes) describes himself as &#x201C;Colorado first.&#x201D; The issues page on his website lists inflation, jobs, veterans, and fiscal responsibility near the top. Scroll further down the page, though, and you&#x2019;ll see Frisch is pro-choice. You&#x2019;ll also notice that he is, in fact, a Democrat.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

<p>You&#x2019;re in a shoe store, trying on a pair of Nikes. The vendor is going on about how great the shoes are, but you&#x2019;re not convinced, so you walk out empty handed. Sometime later, that same vendor pops up out of nowhere in the supermarket. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just wondering if you&#x2019;ve reconsidered the shoes,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got a photo of them right here.&#x201D; You scoff and walk away again, but the vendor keeps coming back; you bump into him on the sidewalk, or at the hardware store. He even breaks into your home and finds you on your living room couch. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d be happy to suggest some other shoes you might like based on your trip to the store,&#x201D; he says.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

<p>Popping up on the edge of the largest park in Shanghai, the city&#x2019;s newest library looks a bit like a towering cruise ship sailing through the canopy of trees below. Covering more than 1.2 million square feet across seven stories and two additional pavilions below, the Shanghai East Library is a giant vessel in its own right. It carries not only books and the kinds of study spaces libraries have always had, but a variety of community, social, and cultural spaces that show how the library as an institution is evolving.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

<p>There are only so many ways to build a piece of furniture, and almost all of them&#x2014;save for Japanese wood joinery or this highly innovative shape-shifting chair&#x2014;involve some form of nails, screws, glue, or electric tools that make the building process virtually irreversible. But for the past five years, a German design studio has been researching a radically different way to join two pieces of wood by clipping them together, a bit like the chin strap on a helmet.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The problems plaguing Meta&#x2019;s metaverse aren&#x2019;t new&#x2014;only now they&#x2019;ve cost 11,000 people their jobs.</p>

<p>The news out of Meta couldn&#x2019;t get much worse, with hundreds of billions in value already lost this year followed by the announcement of massive layoffs at the company. Despite deep pockets and unfathomable reach, there suddenly seems to be little hope for Meta&#x2019;s future right at the very moment that Mark Zuckerberg needs us to believe in the technology that he claims is his company&#x2019;s (and our) future.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It&#x2019;s all about function, not form.</p>

<p>Ukrainian software engineer Vitaly Pushkar has created a blog to peek into the workstations of hackers all over the world. You will not find any Matrix-like 9-display rigs with stacked keyboards and neon lights, though. Or any Architectural Digest-worthy zen workscape living in a Silicon Valley&#x2019;s unicorn paradise. There&#x2019;s nothing in Hacker Stations but the refreshingly mundane, the distillation of function-over-form, just raw simplicity taken to the limit by the spartans of engineering. These people don&#x2019;t give a damn about design trends. And we love it.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

<p>About 5,000 years ago, our ancestors built Stonehenge out of stones they likely hauled for hundreds of miles. This year, our ancestors&#x2019; descendents built Stonehenge 2.0&#x2014;out of 16,000 recycled plastic bottles.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

<p>The view from behind the lenses of a Magic Leap 2 is deceptive. What&#x2019;s seen in this augmented reality headset floats in the middle distance, clear as a computer screen, but is not actually there. Looking around a room during a recent demonstration of the device, the digital overlay stands still, a glowing hologram of information that, despite appearances, is mere millimeters from the eye. The urge to reach out and try to grab it is almost impossible to resist.</p><p>Read Full Story</p>]]></description>

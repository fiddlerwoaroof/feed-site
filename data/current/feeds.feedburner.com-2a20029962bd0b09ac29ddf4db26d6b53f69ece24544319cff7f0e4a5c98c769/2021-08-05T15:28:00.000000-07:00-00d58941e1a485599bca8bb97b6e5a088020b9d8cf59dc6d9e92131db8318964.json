That’s the only way that works, anyway. Paraphrasing Taleb: anything done with explicit intent to improve one’s status likely *won’t *improve one’s status. After all, the most respected people achieved their status as a byproduct of doing something great, like pursuing ambition, honor, and integrity!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/07/29/something-you-cant-buy/\">Communication</a></strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>Your truth and *the *truth are not always the same thing. *The *truth is a fact. Your truth is just an opinion. Nobody values somebody who is honest about their opinions if their opinions always suck. Knowing when to offer your truth and keep your mouth shut is a rare quality. The line between thoughtful dialogue and disrespectful disagreement is razor-thin.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-population-growth-slows-birth-rate-decline-economic-risk-11627231536\">Different world</a></strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-05%20at%203.32.44%20PM-418748.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-05 at 3.32.44 PM-418748.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/351932/americans-life-ratings-reach-record-high.aspx\">“Thriving” at a new record</a></strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/hhnnjuv8m0iqxpykpnv-pq.png\" alt=\"hhnnjuv8m0iqxpykpnv-pq.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a good weekend.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/collabfund/~4/N1v65fHyy78\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"

It is at the heart of how everything works. With the development of applied scientific principles, science enables us to not only understand how things work but how to make use of that understanding in the technology that supports our everyday lives. In this excerpt from their new book, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-All-Works-illustrated-demonstrated/dp/0711256780/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=how+it+all+works+dant&amp;qid=1629914772&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">How it All Works</a></i>, Adam Dant and Brian Clegg take us inside a modern kitchen. Each illustration is accompanied by a short description of the scientific law (marked with an “L”) or phenomena (marked with a “P”) behind the activity or object featured. They show us that in everything we do, in everything we experience, we are witnessing and taking part in scientific phenomena, guided and linked by scientific laws.</p><p></p>  <p></p><p><i>Adam Dant is a contemporary British artist known for his visual narratives realized through elaborate and intricate pen-and-ink drawings.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18712_42b5ce9d23645f2bae146063b2218ae7.png'><br><p>In high school, Daniel Stein built a solar-powered car and drove it across the country. “I got to see the possibility of doing something with my own hands and seeing the success of taking action for what you believe in,” he says, some 30 years later. It’s a slow winter day on the farm as a bearded Stein prepares seeds for the planting season. Soon he will be donning a straw hat, a clean shave, and a T-shirt, most likely swag from his or neighboring farms, as he works the land.</p><p>Today Stein and his wife Taylor Thornton operate an award-winning homestead called Briceland Forest Farm. The couple and their two young sons live in southern Humboldt—one of a triad of counties, alongside Mendocino and Trinity, that comprise the Emerald Triangle. This Northern California sprawl of coast, cliffs, and woods is world famous for its cannabis.</p><p>Indeed, cannabis is Stein’s main cash crop, enabling him to diversify Briceland’s output, growing a variety of vegetables for local restaurants and farmers’ markets. The farm is grounded in the values of “regenerative farming”—“no till,” “living soil”—which lay the foundation for Stein’s mission: to remediate the Earth and sustainably grow food, medicine, and a good high.</p><strong>HIGHER AND HIGHER:</strong> Daniel Stein on his regenerative farm, inspecting his very healthy cannabis. If only selling and distributing his crop could be as satisfying as growing it.Courtesy of Briceland Forest Farm<p>Like many in the Triangle, Stein is a second-generation farmer, tending a 5,000-square-foot plot inherited from his parents—hippies who bought the land for cheap in the 1970s during the “Back to the Land” movement. Young people from cities like New York, such as Stein’s parents, trekked out west to live off the grid, in harmony with nature. To support themselves, they “guerrilla-grew” cannabis in the shadows of the backcountry, hidden in clandestine corners among the forest, mountains, and mist.</p><p>Like his parents, Stein has rejected a life and career in the confines of institutions, with their bureaucracies and environmental sins. “The status quo is comfortable with taking more than giving, using fossil fuels and being extractive, rather than being regenerative and finding creative methods to live,” he says.</p><p>Unlike many of the first hippie farmers, though, Stein has managed to sustain his farm by relying on ecological science—and endless hard work. When he says he lives in harmony with nature, he’s not talking so much about metaphysics but sound ecological principles that propel his business and preserve the land.</p><p>The most obvious break with the first Back-to-the-Landers who went to pot is that Stein grows marijuana legally. Times of course have changed over the past 25 years, with California having legalized medical marijuana in 1996 and then “adult use” (recreational) in 2016. Cannabis is a key component of the ecosystem that allows his entire farm to flourish. In an irony, though, that the flower children could never imagine, growing legal pot has tangled Stein in the red tape he has spent his life avoiding. The regulations that come with selling cannabis from sustainable farms like his constitute the most invasive species in his life. He’s working on a solution.</p><p></p><p>Briceland Forest Farm is nestled beneath skyscraping redwoods and off a hilly road near the town of Redway, population 1,225. The farm abounds with perennials. Its grounds are full of carrots, beets, potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchinis, eggplants, corn, peppers, melons, shishitos, arugula, radishes, and cilantro—not to mention varieties of cannabis. “About everything you can imagine in a farmers’ market, we do in small amounts,” Stein says.</p><p>The farm, with its regenerative methods, is certified organic. Andrew Smith, chief scientist at the Rodale Institute, a nonprofit which created the term “regenerative organic,” explains that soil health is at the heart of the regenerative movement. The healthier the soil, the greater its capacity for carbon sequestration, and the greater the farm’s biodiversity, the healthier soil. Regenerative farming “benefits human health, as well, by eliminating the use of chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides,” Smith says.</p><p>Unlike many of the first hippie farmers, Stein relies on ecological science.</p> <p>A key component of the practice is not tilling the soil. Untilled soil, Stein explains, retains nutrients important to plants’ growth. It also sequesters carbon, helping reduce the release of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, into the atmosphere. Traditionally, and especially in industrial agriculture, farmers prepare the soil by tilling it with a tractor. Tilling churns the surface of the soil, aerates it, and allows it to be mixed with plant material or fertilizer for the next planting.</p><p>“For the first few years of tilling, you get good returns on your soil and your crops grow great,” Stein says. “But what you’re doing is pulverizing diversity within the soil, killing earthworms, fungi, and a lot of the microfauna, and making a soil that’s primarily bacterial dominant. And bacterial-dominant soil is a threat to soil diversity.”</p><p>Without tilling, Stein says, “You end up with a more resilient system, which creates healthier plants and a longer term, more sustainable soil.” Untilled soil, he explains, is “like a sponge,” noting its capacity to hold water and nutrients, which renders them more available to the plants. A no-till system also finds its own balance of fungi, earthworms, microbials, beneficial nematodes, and other flora and fauna beneath the surface of the earth. This method allows farmers to leave plant roots in the ground, even after harvest.</p><p>“The plants take atmospheric carbon and create a carbon structure of roots within the soil,” Stein says. “When you cut the plant and it dies, there’s all that carbon from the atmosphere that’s now deep in the soil profile and becomes stable soil carbon.”</p><p>In the 10 years since founding Briceland, Stein says he’s increased his soil’s stable carbon by about 4 to 5 percent; on less than an acre, he’s been able to sequester more carbon every year than what a car driving across the country and back would produce and put into the atmosphere. “It doesn’t make us carbon neutral,” he says, “but it’s a good-hearted attempt.”</p><p></p><p>Soil health is the foundational element of a regenerative farm. It’s also helped Stein produce a bounty of quality cannabis and highs, and win the area’s top cannabis award, the Emerald Cup, in 2017, for cultivation practices that “go beyond sustainability in that they heal, improve, and remediate.”</p><p>A key method of maintaining soil health is “cover cropping,” or growing plants not necessarily meant to be eaten or sold. Along with his vegetable crops and cannabis, Stein plants grasses and legumes, including oats, beans, and peas. The fast-growing grasses create additional nutrients in the soil. To aid the process, Stein coats the grasses and legumes with layers of fresh compost, wood chips, manure, and straw.</p><p>Along with cover cropping, Stein creates fungal beds and swales (meant to absorb surface runoff back into the soil); this allows vegetation to pull nutrients (that would otherwise pollute the environment) from water as it flows off the property. On his farm, he uses stored winter rainwater, which in Humboldt yields about 80 inches. During the growing season in spring and summer, there is almost no rain, so he draws from a water catchment pond, where he stores it from the wet through dry season.</p><strong>THE HAPPY FARMER:</strong> “Growing and selling veggies isn’t the most profitable business or the most glamorous,” Daniel Stein says. “But it is fulfilling in a way none of the many other jobs I have done in my life have been.”Courtesy of Briceland Forest Farm<p>Stein’s regenerative methods feed both the soil and the quality of his pot. To nourish his cannabis plants, he explains, he must make the right moves throughout the seasons. During harvest in early October, Stein cuts the cannabis plants, leaving the roots in the ground, and puts a layer of compost on the beds; he then seeds the cover crop into the compost, without removing mulch from the previous year.</p><p>Cover crops photosynthesize throughout the winter, bringing up more nutrients from the soil to make them available for the upcoming cannabis planting season in the spring. Once the spring comes along, Stein crimps the cover crop down with flattening boards, then covers it with more compost to start decomposing—facilitating the best possible environment in which to plant the cannabis.</p><p>Growing legal pot has tangled Stein in the red tape he has spent his life avoiding.</p> <p>Tina Gordon of Moon Made Farms, another regenerative cannabis farm in Humboldt County, explains that “companion planting,” which may include nettles or comfrey, is another key tenet. “When there’s diversity, you’re feeding the soil,” she says. “We also use the plants right next to the cannabis to make teas that we then feed back to the cannabis.” Gordon also plants flower gardens that attract bees to the cultivation site. “The more flowers, the more bees, the more bees the healthier, more robust the crops,” she says.</p><p>Throughout the growing season, Stein feeds his cannabis with “fermented plant juice.” He creates the juice by taking plants called “dynamic accumulators,” like horsetail or nettle, that are good at absorbing certain nutrients and minerals, and soaking them in water with a bit of added sugar. “With regenerative practices, you’re creating a balanced ecosystem in the soil,” Stein explains. “You’re giving the plant all that it could possibly want so that it gets to express itself to its fullest, without ever being in want of the proper nutrients and minerals.” A plant’s relationship with soil biology and the plants around it creates a web of mutual support, he adds. “To me, that pure expression of the plant creates a better product, and because of the complexity of the plant life, I know that all the minerals, nutrients, vitamins, and enzymes are available within our soil.”</p><p>Stein says his growing methods allow him to design a specific type of high. He implements certain techniques to bring out the plant’s terpenes, or aromatic compounds, which give the plant its flavor and influence the quality of the high. During the late stages of flowering, the amount and type of stress that a plant endures—such as watering or companion planting—will impact how it expresses its terpenes. “I like having chamomile or yarrow around them to help produce essential oils and terpenes,” Stein says. One of his strains, “Cuddle Bud,” is named for producing a high that’s “sweet, physical, warm, and loving,” he says.</p><p></p><p>Stein is a prolific poster on Facebook. “I love what we do,” he wrote in July. “Growing and selling veggies isn’t the most profitable business or the most glamorous. It is really physically demanding, and the hours seem to never end, but it is fulfilling in a way none of the many other jobs I have done in my life have been. Being outside, working with natural cycles and soil is great. It is endlessly challenging in good and hard ways and always changing.”</p><p>There is, though, one challenge that bedevils Stein, and that is selling his pot. It’s a major challenge because cannabis amounts to most of Briceland Forest Farm’s income. For one thing, it’s expensive to grow pot. Annual fees amount to more than $20,000 a year, he says, and that’s just for “a very small family producer—just us and one helper doing the whole operation, including the veggies.” There’s a cultivation tax that costs $150 for every pound produced, and it doesn’t matter how much that pound is sold for (even if it only sells for $150). “Taxes are not based on our profits, but are a flat tax across the board,” Stein says.</p><p>Stein’s strain, “Cuddle Bud,” produces a high that’s “sweet, physical, warm, and loving.”</p> <p>The biggest legal hassle of selling cannabis, according to Stein, is the California state law mandating multiple middlemen, including distributors, lab testers, and dispensaries. Stein sells his veggies directly to consumers through farmer’s markets and community-supported agriculture subscription services. But each time his cannabis changes hands, each intermediary step takes about 20 percent off the profit. It’s the “cumbersomeness of the laws,” he says, which makes selling weed on the legal, regulated market so difficult. “It doesn’t matter if you grow 10 acres or 10 square feet,” Stein says. “The greater percentage of your profits go to bureaucratic necessities, without much of a reward system for exemplary practices or motivation to stay small and focused on boutique craft cannabis.”</p><p>Essentially, the legal pot market penalizes organic farmers. Due to the California Environmental Air Quality Act, cannabis is considered a “product” rather than a “crop,” explains Kristin Nevedal, board chair and co-founder of the International Cannabis Farmers Association. The idea behind the designation is to keep outdoor cannabis production from impacting the surrounding environment—even if that impact is positive, as in the case of regenerative agriculture. The law incentivizes cannabis farmers to cultivate in a closed environment, like a greenhouse or indoor facility, though it’s nearly impossible to implement regenerative practices in an enclosed system. Regulations also mandate that farmers provide a map of their cultivation activities and have everything approved. So those who implement crop rotation practices may need to apply for a license modification every year. Indoor cultivation sites also qualify for exemptions that outdoor sites don’t.</p><p>“The law in California has been structured around big business and has often approached cannabis as an industrial product and catered to large grows or indoor grows,” Stein says. Big growers can get their per unit cost down, he explains, while small farmers like him, who prioritize land practices, still have to go through all the same legal processes and pay the same fees. He notes that at least the regulations mandate third-party testing for toxic herbicides and pesticides.</p><p>But in September 2020, California passed a law that is changing the fortunes of organic pot growers. The law establishes “appellations of origin” for cannabis that’s grown in certain geographic areas of the state. Weed grown within a certain terroir, such as in Mendocino County, can receive a special designation, reminiscent of the terroirs used in the wine industry, such as Bourdeaux in Southern France and Napa in Northern California.</p><p>“There’s this idea that there are lots of factors that go into a product that are of the place where it is grown,” he says. “You can feel, taste, and experience it in the cannabis.” Soil types, growing practices, and other markers link multiple farms in an area and give consumers a sense of where the cannabis comes from. “Having this experience where you can create something of a place and share it with people who can learn to recognize those differences on their own—I’m glad we’re laying down the tracks now, so later on we can use that as a tool for communication with our customers,” Stein says.</p><p>Stein is proud to have revived and sustained the land he inherited from his parents. His regenerative approach to farming has allowed his family’s environmental values to live on. “Small farmers are less likely to exploit land, people, and situations to make money,” says Stein. “It’s all right in front of us, we want to see it cared for.”</p><p></p><p><i>Madison Margolin is a New York/California-based journalist covering cannabis, psychedelics, and Jewish culture.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18717_ec3fafed7bab31c3deaae02f52e5505a.png'><br><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;" align="center">“Occasionally, when Ammu listened to songs that she loved on the radio, something stirred inside her. A liquid ache spread under her skin, and she walked out of the world like a witch, to a better, happier place …” —Arundhati Roy, <i>The God of Small Things</i></p><p></p><p>We’ve all felt the need. To just drop whatever loads we’re bearing, retreating to some private realm where our worldly concerns fade into oblivion. Freed from responsibilities, anxieties, hurts, and other miscellaneous burdens, if only transiently.</p><p>My earliest recollection of the urge must’ve been when I was around 5. My mother was colorfully scolding me the way Indian mothers do, for something I probably did but nevertheless felt unjustly prosecuted for. Turning to the sky beyond the window of our apartment building, I remember becoming consumed by what it would be like to be the letter R. Just being the letter R. Where I could exist wherever it was that letters existed, in solid form, bathed in saturated white light, finding solace in the emptiness, where feelings didn’t exist.</p><p>After a sleepless night in an orange jumpsuit in a maximum-security immigration-detention facility, I was taken back to the airport.</p> <p>The urge to retreat from reality can take on a compulsive nature for some, whether it’s into the worlds in video games, literature, or some other obsession. For others, the choice instead is to palliate reality through alcohol or other assorted fixes. Although I’m no stranger to any of these, the most soothing flight from the mundane I’ve come to seek comfort in over the years has been the retreat into my work. The <i>real</i> stuff of my work that is, not the worldly responsibilities that go along with it. Although I do take great pride in the latter, nothing comes close to providing me the solace, sometimes even deliverance, as some of my flights into the corner realms of theoretical physics. I recognize the solipsism and selfishness in this, but also the act of self-preservation that it represents.</p><strong>THE HIGH OF DISCOVERY:</strong> “It’s a rush that never gets old, no matter how niche or subtle the result, no matter how few people end up caring about it, let alone citing your paper,” writes Subodh Patil (above), about cracking a scientific problem. “To me, it’s the real stuff of being a physicist. Of being alive.”William Barker<p>Perhaps the seeds were planted in a somewhat difficult childhood and adolescence growing up in Hong Kong and onto a young adulthood, struggling to navigate the different worlds I had to straddle as a many-time immigrant. Perhaps it was perpetuated by the need to seek refuge whenever something about the world would confuse or frighten me. Although I didn’t know it at the time, my reflexive retreats into abstract realms was the nursery in which my individuality was fostered as a teenager. It wasn’t just that my parents would leave me alone when I was hunched over a desk, scribbling on scraps of paper or buried in a book; that nursery was an invisible and formidable shield against any of their expectations that conflicted with the personhood I was beginning to assert. A struggle for the self that many immigrant children have to confront in some way.</p><p>But there was another edge to it. Like many of my fellow travelers, what drew me to the worlds of theoretical physics was also seeded in my earliest existential doubts, and the struggle to come to terms with the answers the people around me seemed to content themselves with.</p><p></p><p>I will never forget my first real bout with a question. I was a few years into grad school at Brown University, and just beginning to find my legs as a researcher. My first two papers had just come out, and I had just moved in with my girlfriend at the time in New Haven, commuting to Providence for my weekly meetings with my advisor. In a matter of days, the ground beneath my feet fell out from under me.</p><p>In the drawn out aftermath of 9/11, immigration problems entirely of my own making resulted in my being denied entry to the United States after a visit to Mumbai, to which my folks had moved back. I was ruled inadmissible over a run-in with the law many years before, when I was a teenager. It didn’t result in any charges, but did manage to linger on a computer somewhere. After a sleepless night in an orange jumpsuit in a maximum-security immigration-detention facility, I was taken back to the airport where I was told by Customs and Border Patrol agents that I’d probably never see these shores again. I did. But only after six of the longest months of my life, spent in a daze of uncertainty and anxiety over whether I’d ever be able to go back to my former existence. During this limbo, I frequented the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research in Mumbai, where my advisor had arranged a precious desk for me so that I could keep working. It was home to a vibrant community of string theorists who warily welcomed me. I was thrust into an intellectual hothouse of blackboard discussions, and seminars that would always go way over the allotted time that helped me momentarily forget why I was there.</p><p>Without the ability to scribble anything in the margins, I’d while away the commutes manipulating symbols the best I could in my mind.</p> <p>Several of the researchers at the Tata Institute were working on what seemed like impossibly simple transcriptions of string theory known as matrix models. As the name suggests, matrix models encode the complicated dynamics of objects within string theory into the dynamics of two-by-two arrays of numbers, or matrices, familiar to anyone who’s ever taken a linear algebra class. People were beginning to notice structures arising within matrix models that made them wonder if it could really be a description of M-theory, the supposed parent theory from which all string theories descend.</p><p>I was hooked. I started devouring papers on the subject, many of which I could barely understand. I also had the nerve to find minor gaps in certain derivations that just didn’t sit right with me. The researchers I spoke to brushed them off as inconsequential, but I just couldn’t let go of the doubts.</p> <p>There are different types of infinity. The most familiar perhaps, is one you can count your way toward. One, two, three, and so on, to countable infinity, denoted somewhat biblically as ℵ0, or aleph-zero. The other should also be familiar, but slightly more abstract: <i>un</i>countable infinity, or ℵ1. It represents the number of real numbers between zero and one. That these infinities are not the same was proved in the late 19th century by Georg Cantor in a manner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor's_diagonal_argument" target="_blank">so simple</a>, you could sketch it out to your friends on a bar napkin. It’s one of the most beautiful and profound results in all of mathematics, one that I would rederive for myself multiple times over the years and still scarcely believe. (In fact, many of Cantor’s contemporaries didn’t believe it, either. He died alone and in penury in a sanatorium, the result of a steady decline in health after years of ridicule and professional humiliation.)</p> <p>The thing about matrices is that they can also have a very large number of entries, even up to countable infinity. These so-called infinite-dimensional matrices have a very different algebra from finite-dimensional ones. The thing about certain matrix models is that their finite-dimensional versions are supposed to be taken only as approximations to the underlying dynamics they’re trying to capture, becoming exact only in the infinite-dimensional limit. I thought about this for weeks. Weeks where crippling anxiety had reduced me to a displaced and disjointed shadow of my former self.</p><p>In the searing heat, I would commute almost two hours each way, from the Tata Institute to my parents’ apartment in the far northern suburbs. Mumbai commuter trains are not for the faint-hearted. Riders cram themselves into carriages running at thrice their capacity, in a self-organized human jigsaw that would sometimes find you dangling outside the permanently open doors of carriage, where at least you could breathe freely. Collective suffering, however artificially induced, unfailingly brings out the best in people. The unspoken kindness and indifference with which people would elbow past each other, occasionally trampling on each other’s feet on their way in and out of the train, is a lesson in letting go I update myself with every time I’m back in Mumbai.</p><p>I’d always be reading physics papers on these long commutes. One arm wedged against my body, holding a paper at head height, the other, finding some form of grip to maintain a precarious balance as the carriage swayed back and forth, my center of gravity now in a collective with other bodies packed tightly against mine. Without the ability to scribble anything in the margins, I’d while away the commutes manipulating symbols the best I could in my mind.</p><p>On one such journey, I came to with a pounding sensation in my head, which was now wedged between my knees. A fellow commuter was holding out a bottle of water for me, another was handing me back <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9910053" target="_blank">the crumpled paper</a> I was reading. I don’t remember how I got there, but the evidence suggested I had passed out and was shepherded to the nearest seat. Taking advantage of the predicament, I assured everyone I was okay, and remained slouched over for the rest of my commute, crying silently into my duffle bag.</p><p>I’ve come to appreciate that you form personal relationships with some of the problems you end up working on.</p> <p>Not knowing what else to do, I would lose myself for hours on end over the following days in the algebra of matrices, of strings ending on membranes, of the mathematics of infinity. No flashes of insight, no grand epiphanies, just slow and steady deliberation over subtle details. The dull aches that had characterized my inner state for months up till then transiently tempered. Finding uncomplicated pleasures in the purity and simplicity of the abstractions in front of me. I had slowly come to realize that there was a straightforward way to map the multiplication of infinite-dimensional matrices into the calculus of continuous functions. I saw that, in fact, my earlier doubts were founded. I had cracked an opening to an extension of a particular matrix model that hadn’t been noticed before.</p><p>I called it a <i>central extension</i>, which was familiar terminology from other infinite-dimensional algebras seen in string theory. It was then that I finally felt a gush of joy, as after all that steady deliberation, new solutions that hadn’t been noticed before starting falling out naturally. They had the geometry of cylinders, and warped planes. <i>Fuzzy</i> cylinders and <i>fuzzy</i> planes, whose geometry is quantum rather than continuum. It’s a rush that never gets old, no matter how niche or subtle the result, no matter how few people end up caring about it, let alone citing your paper. To me, it’s the real stuff of being a physicist. Of being alive.</p><p>A few months later, I received a new visa to return to the U.S. with a waiver for the inadmissibility that kept me out many months earlier. I felt incredibly lucky, blessed, and privileged, given what my lawyer had conveyed to me would be the likeliest outcome.

What I really wanted to say to them was thank you for keeping me sane. Thank you for helping me through the worst of all of this by paving the way for the flights of imagination that turned into this paper.</p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;">“On the days that the radio played Ammu’s songs, everyone was a little wary of her.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18681_e633725b1ff30de3c9fd8212087f931b.jpg'><br><p><i>What should you do if you are worried about your popularity? Relax. Despite what Facebook tells us, it’s the quality of friendships that count, not the quantity, and certainly not your average popularity.</i>Photograph by Ivelin Radkov / Shutterstock</p><p>There’s a rude charm to the title, “Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You.” It’s catchy, like the title of an antagonistic explainer: Here are the causes of your lackluster social life. It sounds more like a <i>New York Times</i> op-ed than an academic paper. But in fact, “Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You” is a 1991 <a href="http://wiskundemeisjes.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Why-your-friends-have-more-friends-than-you-do.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> from Scott Feld published in the <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>. It now has some claim to fame for introducing into popular culture the so-called “friendship paradox,” which researchers have used to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092413" target="_blank">detect</a> the early onset of contagious outbreaks and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.247901#fulltext" target="_blank">design</a> effective vaccination strategies. New research, published in the <i>Journal of Complex Networks</i>, suggests the paradox is more nuanced than Feld figured it to be.</p><p>The paradox stems from our poor intuitions about networks and averages. If you were to guess how many friends you have, compared to the number of friends your friends have, how would you fare? You may say it’s your friends that have more friends than you, if you’re feeling modest. But it’s also the case that some of those friends who have more friends than you <i>also</i> have friends who have more friends than them, and so on. The friendship paradox says that this is true for everyone—on average, everyone has friends with more friends than they have.</p><p>We have a paradox of paradoxes.</p> <p>How is that possible? The paradox goes beyond friendship. It holds true any time you have a network of objects where any two of them are either connected or not connected. Mathematicians call the objects “nodes,” the connections “edges,” and the whole network a “graph.” Two nodes are “neighbors” if they are connected by an edge, and the number of neighbors of a node is called its “degree.” You can define a sort of “net popularity” of a node by taking its degree and subtracting the average degree of its neighbors. For example, if I am friends with Annika, Bing Wen, Carolina, and Daud, and Annika has (including me) three friends, Bing Wen has five friends, Carolina has seven friends, and Daud has five friends, then my net popularity is:</p><p> 4 – (3+5+7+5)/4 = -1. </p><p>It is a mathematical fact that if you average over all of the net popularities in a network, then that average will be negative: Your friends have more friends than you do. You are more likely to be Carolina’s friend than Annika’s, exactly because Carolina has more friends. If someone has lots of friends, one of them is more likely to be you. In his paper, Feld suggested that this might be psychologically significant. People, when they wonder how many friends they ought to have, could be looking at the number of friends their friends have as a point of comparison, which will almost always leave them feeling inadequate. A 2017 <a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0100-1" target="_blank">paper</a> identified a “happiness paradox” and suggested that it might be related to the friendship paradox—perhaps your friends are also happier than you are because they are more popular. </p><p>But in a new <a href="https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article/9/2/cnab011/6287259" target="_blank">paper</a>, a trio of researchers from the Santa Fe Institute and the University of Michigan, who study physics and networks, show that the truth of the friendship paradox isn’t as gloomy as it might seem. There are some networks where the friendship paradox doesn’t meaningfully manifest at all. The authors—George Cantwell, Alec Kirkley, and Mark Newman—confirmed this by comparing their mathematical results against over 30 real-world networks, including among <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219525903001067" target="_blank">jazz musicians</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/2/404/" target="_blank">collaborating scientists</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015457400897" target="_blank">drug users</a>, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-003-0651-y" target="_blank">dolphins</a>. So, if you were ever bummed out in the way Feld suggested, cheer up—the reality is much more complicated than the headline. You might be more popular than one single number makes it seem.</p><p>Statisticians have long understood that there are different ways to compute the “average” of something, with different advantages and disadvantages. The method I described above—add up all of the values and divide by the number—is more technically known as the “mean.” One disadvantage of the mean is that it is particularly sensitive to extra values. This is often referred to as the Bill Gates effect: if 10 middle-class people are sitting in a bar and Bill Gates walks in, the average income in the bar jumps from five to nine digits. This jump doesn’t really show the real-world experience of the bar-goers, however. (Except they get to brag that they had a drink with Bill Gates.)</p><p>Similarly, Cantwell and his colleagues give the example of 1,000 people who are all friends with each other except two—call them Avital and Boris. Those two are friends with everyone else but not with each other. That means that 998 people will have 999 friends each, and 2 people will have 998 friends each. For most people, the net popularity will be:</p><p>999 – (999 + 999 + … + 999 + 998 + 998)/999 ≈ .002</p><p>But for Avital and Boris, the net popularity will be:</p><p>998 - (999 + 999 + … + 999 + 999 + 998)/999 ≈ -0.999</p><p>Due to the Bill Gates effect, the average net-popularity of the entire friend network will be pulled negative by Avital and Boris, despite everyone else in that network actually being more popular, on average, than their friends. </p><p>The simplest way to choose a network at random is to pick a probability, say 25 percent, and give every two nodes an edge 25 percent of the time and no edge 75 percent of the time. This is called a <i>Poisson random graph</i>, after the French mathematician Siméon Poisson. Cantwell and his colleagues show that, although the mean net popularity of such a graph will usually be around -1, confirming the mathematical friendship paradox, in fact, a large fraction of the nodes will have <i>positive</i> net-popularity. As the average number of neighbors of a node gets large, the fraction of nodes with positive net-popularity gets closer and closer to 50 percent. For these graphs, as they say, “no meaningful ‘friendship paradox’ applies.”</p><p>So now we have a paradox of paradoxes; the friendship paradox is true mathematically, but very often has no practical consequence due to the Bill Gates effect. What should you do if you are worried about your popularity? Relax. Despite what Facebook tells us, it’s the quality of friendships that count, not the quantity, and certainly not your average popularity. Enjoy your time with whatever friends you have. And if you see Bill Gates, tell him to call me.</p><p><i>Joshua Holden is professor of mathematics at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and the author of </i>The Mathematics of Secrets: Cryptography from Caesar Ciphers to Digital Encryption.</p><br><a href='http://nautil.us/blog/why-you-may-have-more-friends-than-your-friends-do?utm_source=RSS_Feed&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication'>Read More…</a>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18670_f357918b9afbbe4c29136d76033fc2ea.png'><br><p>On March 11, 2021, the auction house Christie’s sold a work by an American graphic designer, Michael Winkelmann, a.k.a. Beeple, for a colossal $69 million, making it the third most expensive work ever sold by a living artist. The work, <i><a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924" target="_blank">Everydays: The First 5000 Days</a></i>, is a nonfungible token, or NFT. It’s a computer file that cannot be exchanged, copied, or destroyed, which gives the purchaser proof of authenticity. It lives online in a virtual space—an immaterial space—in a blockchain, a secure digital public ledger. The file is a mint copy, an original, like the <i>Mona Lisa</i> that hangs in the Louvre. It’s also a work of art.</p><p><i>Everydays</i> exemplifies a new generation of digital art that uses computers in adventurous ways and is pushing boundaries, just as artists from Da Vinci to Picasso to Rothko have always done. Even more exciting is AI art, generated by machines with just a little prompting by humans. It’s exciting because AI art may one day show us how machines see the world.</p><p>The point is not whether we can distinguish AI-created music from human music but whether machines will be able to create music of their own, music we cannot imagine.</p> <p>For 5,000 days straight—nearly 15 years—Beeple created images, sometimes by hand, sometimes digitally, and posted them online. He then made a vast collage of his work on a jpg. The individual tiles are colorful and highly imaginative. Some are dystopian sci-fi images, some abstract, some crude sketches, others political or satirical. What I find endlessly fascinating is the incredible variety and detail of the images. It’s fascinating to <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/Monumental-collage-by-Beeple-is-first-purely-digital-artwork-NFT-to-come-to-auction-11510-7.aspx?sc_lang=en&amp;lid=1" target="_blank">zoom in on tiles</a>. There are scatological images, people rollerblading among giant juice bottles, disturbing otherworldly images of astronauts, some nightmarish, some surreal, all colorful and inventive. The whole contents of a weird imagination are there to be seen.</p><p>Like all original works of art, <i>Everydays</i> has a subject, theme, and a point of view. Beeple’s images express his take on current events. He resents accumulation of wealth by the few, is critical of America’s political turbulence, and delves into what’s new on Twitter.</p><p>Another element of art is the aesthetic of a work, which sets it apart from other works and is what makes it original. Cubist art had its own aesthetic—the reduction of forms to geometry—and so does <i>Everydays</i>, a sort of sci-fi, comic book, surreal aesthetic. <i>Everydays</i> can also be compared to Hieronymus Bosch’s otherworldly paintings, which must have seemed utterly shocking in their day.</p><p>Artists before Beeple had turned their works into NFTs but Beeple was the first to transform a checkerboard of 5,000 images into a single NFT, which tickled the fancy of Christie’s, no less. But for all the talent and creativity of digital artists like Beeple, it’s AI art, which is creating images never imagined before, that brings into focus the differences, or, more to the point, the lack of differences, between us and machines.</p><p>Beeple’s art is generated by digital software packages such as Adobe Photoshop that allow artists to manipulate images, rather like manipulating a paintbrush. AI art, on the other hand, is created by algorithms, the set of instructions that you program into the machine to tell it what to do. With AI art, it’s the machine that manipulates the paintbrush.</p><p>Chief among artists who employ artificial intelligence in their creations is Mario Klingemann. Klingemann uses an artificial neural network, a machine whose architecture resembles the way the human brain is wired. On this he runs a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), made up of a generator and a discriminator network. Data, often digital images, are coded into a GAN. The generator then creates images from, essentially, nothing—data noise—and then passes them to the discriminator network. The network assesses whether each image is real or not.</p><p>Klingemann’s discriminator network is trained on thousands of faces harvested from the Web. At first the generator creates formless blobs that are rejected by the discriminator. Soon the generator is no longer generating images from nothing, but from the rejected images, which begin to form its database, its memory. These are faces that belong to no one in our world. We could say that the generator network is imagining, beginning to construct an inner world of its own. In this way Klingemann created <i>Mitosis</i>, meaning the moment when the embryo begins to form.</p><strong>MITOSIS:</strong> In a still from a video loop, created by Mario Klingemann, faces belong to no one in our world. We could say the computer generating the artwork is imagining, constructing an inner world of its own.Mario Klingemann<p><a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/mitosis" target="_blank"><i>Mitosis</i> is a two-minute video loop</a> made up of over 750,000 faces continually being generated by a GAN. The ever-changing face in <i>Mitosis</i> symbolizes how AI is becoming an integral part of our daily life, changing us in subtle ways that are noticeable only in hindsight. The effect is akin to Cubist art, where the viewer sees a scene from many different perspectives, one at a time. Besides the eye-catching checkerboard array, it reflects the Cubist aesthetic. While Beeple’s work is static, a checkerboard of tiny squares, Klingemann’s is endlessly moving and changing before our eyes. Far from cartoon-like, it has the gravity of a black and white photograph. These are images created not by the human artist but by the machine.</p><p></p><p>AI art like Klingemann’s shows that machines can imagine what we cannot imagine and see what we cannot see. This is especially evident in artificial neural networks that run the DeepDream algorithm invented by Alexander Mordvintsev initially to probe the machine’s “hidden layers” of neurons to glean a better understanding of how they work. Basically, DeepDream overinterprets an image, which gives a sense of how individual neurons contribute to it.</p><p>Suppose we take an artificial neural network running DeepDream and trained on ImageNet, a huge database of 14 million images. We feed in a jpg of Van Gogh’s <i>Starry Night</i>, then stop analysis partway through. Will the machine see a fuzzy image of Van Gogh’s painting? No. What it produces changes every time, but it might come out with something like the one below—the world as seen through the eyes of a machine. We could not have imagined such images before DeepDream created them.</p><strong>STARRY NIGHT:</strong> This image, below one of Vincent Van Gogh’s most renowned paintings, shows how an artificial neural network “sees” the Dutch master’s “Starry Night.” Haunting, isn’t it?DeepDream<p>DeepDream’s works have been included in many exhibitions including the Gray Area show of 2016, which was the first to reveal the esoteric world of artificial intelligence to the public. They are totally new, have no link with art of the past, and have a style all their own, a unique aesthetic. We can recognize a DeepDream work just as we recognize a Rembrandt or a Monet. They also push the boundaries of conventional art in that they have no specific subject matter. They are the world as seen by an alien being, a machine, like the images created by machines running GANs. This is what I find so exciting with DeepDream. You never know what to expect and whatever emerges is nothing you could have imagined.</p><p>Another fascinating example of computer-generated art is Refik Anadol’s work. It’s a stunning example of the potential of machines to dream, to create a new world of extraordinary and beautiful images. Anadol, a media artist, took 1.7 million documents relating to Turkey, from the late 19th century to the present, from a Turkish art institution and online library called SALT Galata, and encoded them all in numbers. <i>Archive Dreaming</i> is an immersive media installation. Viewers stand in a cylindrical room and the images are projected onto the walls and onto them.</p><strong>ARCHIVE DREAMING:</strong> This still is from an immersive installation by media artist Refik Anadol. He took 1.7 million documents relating to Turkey, from the late 19th century to the present, and encoded them all in numbers.Refik Anadol<p>When the installation is dormant, a GAN comes into play, using a discriminator network trained on these 1.7 million documents. The generator network begins generating images which soon start to look much like the real ones but are documents that have never existed. Viewers are surrounded by a whirl of images in which it’s impossible to distinguish real from unreal. These images are new representations of the original subjects and texts, which are designated as art, so the images too are art. To me the interactive aspect is especially intriguing. The audience becomes part of it, with others seeing views of the work as it moves over the contours of your body. As in Borges’s “The Library of Babel,” on a library generated by 22 letters of the alphabet, plus punctuation marks, there is literally an infinity of images.</p><p></p><p>The images generated by DeepDream and GAN demonstrate how art and technology are fusing in the 21st century. For the moment, human artists program the machines. But it is the machines themselves that do the creating, going beyond the parameters set up by their human programmers.</p><p>Can AI art really be called art? Few question whether AI-created music is music. Some AI researchers, for instance, have trained artificial neural networks on hundreds of scores by Bach. Having learned the rules of baroque music, the machines come up with more of the same. It’s a long way from Bach because at present machines are rather limited and have neither emotions nor the memory of scores by Bach’s predecessors, as Bach did. But asked to pick which of two pieces is Bach and which by a machine, only about 50 percent of the listeners will make the right choice.</p><p>Next to make a splash will be art created entirely by machines with humans nowhere in the picture.</p> <p>But it’s a pointless exercise. The point is not whether we can distinguish AI-created music from human music but whether machines will be able to create music of their own, music which at present we cannot imagine. There are already machines, <a href="https://nsynthsuper.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">such as nSynth</a>, capable of producing musical sounds we’ve never heard before, and which musicians can use to create music.</p><p>But how can a machine made up of wires and transistors, created and programmed by human beings, be considered creative? While Mozart’s father taught him the rules of composition, we don’t attribute the son’s music to the father. Similarly, there’s no need to attribute the music or art a machine creates to its programmer. As for human creativity, we ourselves are an amalgam of bones, muscles, arteries, and veins. And we are clearly creative.</p><p>What’s so different about the components of a machine? Like us, machines have a memory and can respond to the world around them and are built to adapt as they learn and think. When you feed pixels, text, or musical notes into an artificial neural network, they are all encoded and stored in the machine’s memory as numbers. We can imagine sculpting with words or musical notes or transforming Picasso’s <i>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon</i> into a symphony.</p><p>This goes for us too. We too are machines. At one level we are biological machines made up of muscles, bones, arteries, and veins; at a deeper level, chemical machines; and at the deepest level, neutrons, protons, gluons, and the rest of the elementary particles. In theory, the dynamics of these elementary particles can be calculated using the equations of quantum physics, which when encoded for computers become numbers. It’s numbers all the way down.</p><p>Next to make a splash will be art created entirely by machines with humans nowhere in the picture. AI art is already developing akin to the way in which human art has developed through the millennia. By doing so, AI art is opening our own minds, causing us to reflect on ourselves, what we’re made of, who we are. The next step will be when we merge with machines.</p><p></p><p><i><a href="https://www.arthurimiller.com/" target="_blank">Arthur I.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18678_42c88875bb90aeed57f01609fef5d9d7.png'><br><p>Humans have always strived to develop technologies that give us some control, or at least the feelings of control, over the challenges that life throws at us. Psychologists like me devote our professional lives to figuring out why people think and feel what they do, and, in cases where those thoughts or actions are undesirable, to helping people change. We conduct experiments to see whether a certain type of drug or therapy alleviates anxiety or pain. We test “nudges,” such as policies that require people to opt in or opt out of a program, to help them save for retirement or become an organ donor. We design and evaluate social and dating algorithms and platforms to help connect people who might otherwise feel isolated. We aim to satisfy people’s urgent desires for science-backed life hacks that will make them smarter, healthier, and happier.</p><p>This is all great. We’re lucky to be living at a time when the rate of discovery and the flow of information has never been quicker. But for thousands of years, humans have gone about developing tools outside of the strict scientific method. Much of what psychologists and neuroscientists have learned about how to change people’s beliefs, feelings, and behaviors—how to support them when they grieve, how to help them find connection and happiness—echo ideas and techniques that religions have been using for thousands of years.</p><p>You can think of tantric sex as a “connection hack,” because that’s exactly how it operates.</p> <p>I firmly believe the scientific method is a wonder. It’s a framework that offers one of the best ways to test ideas about how the world works. But when it comes to thinking about how to help people through life’s travails, we scientists shouldn’t be starting from scratch. If we remove the theology—views about the nature of God, the creation of the universe, and the like—from the day-to-day practice of religious faith, most of the debates that stoke animosity between science and religion evaporate. What we’re left with is a series of rituals, customs, and sentiments that are themselves the results of experiments of sorts. Over thousands of years, these experiments, carried out in the messy thick of life as opposed to sterile labs, have led to the design of what we might call spiritual technologies—tools and processes meant to sooth, move, convince, or otherwise tweak the mind. To ignore that body of knowledge is to slow the progress of science itself and limit its potential benefit to humanity.</p><p>Let’s look at one of those spiritual technologies, one that satisfies some of the deepest yearnings humans experience. Yearnings for union and meaning. For many people, the word “tantra” brings to mind techniques for enhancing sexual pleasure. And if you google “tantra,” you’ll find lots of links to <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, Goop, and other wellness sites that present it mostly in this context. They might give a quick nod to its spiritual potential, but most of the discussion will focus on physical ecstasy.</p><p>In its original incarnation, though, tantra wasn’t about pleasure. It was a set of beliefs and techniques meant to break people out of their normal patterns of thought and ways of seeing the world. The goal was to foster a direct experience with the divine. While some tantric techniques involved taboo practices (e.g., eating meat or drinking alcohol if your religion usually forbade it, sitting on a corpse to meditate on death), others relied on direct manipulations of the body to achieve altered states. All of them were meant to help people feel a sense of communion with something greater than themselves.</p><p>When it comes to tantric techniques, the ones that leverage the body’s wiring—and an easy way to do that is via sex—use a deep feeling of connection with another person as a jumping-off point to that greater transcendent experience. And either or both these types of connection can banish the loneliness that life sometimes brings, especially as people strike out on their own.</p><p>Because they use the body to manipulate the mind, most tantric sexual techniques focus on physical elements. They share an emphasis on deep breathing and breath control, touch and massage, affirming mutual eye gazes, and synchronous movement. The goal isn’t to rush to climax; it’s to bond and connect as those taking part lose themselves in each other.</p><p>Like many spiritual technologies, the tools that make up tantric sex are well thought out: the combined implementation of the ​​breathing, the massaging, the gazing, and the bodily syncing exerts a specific influence on the mind. You can think of it as a “connection hack,” because that’s exactly how it operates. To see why, we first need to take a brief look at how the human body is wired for connection.</p><p></p><p>Polyvagal theory (PVT) provides a perfect lens for viewing the physiology of connection. In Latin, <i>vagus</i> means wandering, and that’s an apt name for the body’s longest nerve. After leaving the brainstem, the vagus nerve snakes through the body, extending its fibers to a host of muscles and organs: parts of the mouth and throat, the heart, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines, to name a few. The vagus nerve also does double duty: It delivers information from the body to the brain as it conveys orders from the brain to the body.</p><p>The vagus nerve has two branches. The more ancient one is common to most animals. Reptiles have it; so do fish. Its purpose is simple: to keep the animal from harm by activating the fight-or-flight system. It elevates heart rate and breathing so that animals can escape threats. Or, when escape is all but impossible, it makes animals play dead or faint, as most predators avoid eating carrion.</p><p>This change in the brain’s normal electrical patterns can alter how people experience the world.</p> <p>Animals aren’t always being preyed on, of course. They have less stressful periods too. If you’re a turtle, lizard, or frog, there’s not that much else you need to do during much of this time except feed. Otherwise, except for a quick, nonintimate mating here and there, best to sit tight, conserve your energy, or keep looking for some food. But if you’re a mammal, and especially if you’re a human, sitting alone isn’t helpful. Many would consider it problematic. It’s through building and reinforcing social connections that most mammals improve their situation in life. It’s how we humans form the bonds necessary for our survival and well-being. And that’s why we, unlike turtles and the like, have a second, newer branch of the vagus nerve to help us thrive.</p><p>This newer branch has three primary functions. The first centers on the heart and its ties to respiration. As activity in the vagus—also known as vagal tone—increases, a person’s heart rate and respiration slow. The second function centers on the endocrine system. As vagal tone goes up, the release of stress hormones in the body goes down. Higher vagal tone works like a brake on our physiology; it calms us. The third function centers on communication. Increased vagal tone enhances emotional expression in the face, the inner ear’s ability to tune itself to the frequencies most associated with human speech, and the larynx’s ability to relax and produce tones in a more soothing range. All told, heightened vagal tone primes people to socialize, communicate, and connect.</p><p>There’s a good deal of research showing that increased vagal tone supports stronger and more empathic bonds between people. In children, for example, heightened vagal tone predicts more positive emotions, fewer problematic behaviors toward others, and increased social skills. In adults, greater vagal tone is associated with better social connectedness, enhanced well-being, and greater empathy for others. And in the case of romantic love, a couple’s vagal tone becomes regularly elevated—a calming of cardiac reactivity that works to buttress them against stress.</p><p>Religions have found ways to manipulate vagal tone in order to increase our sense of connection and empathy, perhaps most notably in the practice of tantric sex. When couples follow tantric practice, intentionally slowing and deepening their breathing, caressing each other and gazing into each other’s eyes, their heart rates decrease as their vagal tones rise. Tantric sex is less about orgasm than it is about creating a transcendent sense of connection.</p><p>Direct manipulation of vagal tone through touch, breath control, and gaze aren’t the only arrows tantric sex has in its quiver. It also changes people’s physiological states via synchronization. Psychophysiologists have known for decades that as the physical distance between people decreases, their bodily rhythms begin to mirror one another. Their breathing and heart rates become synchronized. Greater synchronization creates a stronger sense of connection. As two lovers begin to align their movements, it becomes easier for each person to predict the other’s thoughts and feelings. Synchrony helps intuition as bodily states begin to match.</p><p></p><p>Connection works the other way too. Synchrony doesn’t just make people feel closer to each other; how close they emotionally feel at the start of any encounter can also affect synchrony. For example, studies show that conversing couples’ heart rhythms, respiration rates, and vagal tones tend to synchronize, but the fidelity of the linkage—the degree to which the physiological signals move in lockstep between the partners—depends on their marital satisfaction. The happier they are with each other, the more their bodily states mirror each other. Over time, this means that as each act of tantric sex brings lovers closer, it also sets up the next encounter to provide an even stronger experience of connection.</p><p>Unlike some spiritual practices, the elements of tantric sex don’t need to be closely tied to specific theological principles. They rely more on controlling the body to influence the mind. Like meditation, tantric practice is adaptable to a variety of purposes and faiths. There’s a new breed of Christian sex coaches who teach these techniques and professors at major Christian universities who are researching their history and the role sex might have played in early Judeo-Christian thought. Removing Hindu and Buddhist religious notions doesn’t alter the way tantric techniques affect the body and mind. The practice can work without the theology. So if you’re interested in this route to connection with a partner, these tools are quite easy to incorporate.</p><p>But what about transcendence? If you’re using tantric sex to connect with more than just your partner, an altered state of consciousness has to be involved somewhere. Here’s where the rhythmic aspect of tantric sex comes in. The synchronized groove that tantric lovers attain doesn’t only produce a deep sense of bonding; it also can change conscious experience. Sustained rhythmic, physical stimulation leads to neural entrainment—an alignment of neural signals that produces an explosion in brain activity. If you think of the brain as a blob with electrical pulses running through it, neural entrainment means that the pulses don’t seem random. They seem to be occurring in time with each other, as if the whole brain is pulsing to the same rhythm. As these pulses mirror each other, they reinforce each other until the power of this signal interferes with the normal operation of the brain.</p><p>This change in the brain’s normal electrical patterns can alter how people experience the world. Your brain interprets the information that comes in from your eyes, ears, and other sense organs. So when your brain gets hijacked, so, too, do your senses. The result is that lovers will feel not only closer to each other but further from everyday reality. They might suddenly sense the divine with the same kind of clarity and immediacy with which they usually feel the normal world every day. This is the original purpose of tantra and why—despite its R-rated reputation in some quarters—it qualifies fully as a spiritual practice.</p><p></p><p><i>David DeSteno is a professor of psychology at Northeastern University.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/17320_e98f2cd4e9f56a133abed423adb51d83.png'><br><p>When I was about 6, my mind did something wondrous, although it felt perfectly natural at the time. When I encountered the name of any day of the week, I automatically associated it with a color or a pattern, always the same one, as if the word embodied the shade. Sunday was dark maroon, Wednesday a sunshiny golden yellow, and Friday a deep green. Saturday was interestingly different. That day evoked in my mind’s eye a pattern of shifting and overlapping circular forms in shades of silver and gray, like bubbles in a glass of sparkling water.</p><p>Without knowing it, I was living the unusual mental state called synesthesia, aptly described by synesthesia researcher Julia Simner as a “condition in which ordinary activities trigger extraordinary experiences.” More exactly, it is a neurological event where excitation of one of the five senses arouses a simultaneous reaction in another sense or senses (the Greek roots for “synesthesia,” also spelled “synaesthesia,” translate as “joined perception”). Some 4 percent of the population experiences this kind of cross-sensory linking, and studies have shown it’s more prevalent in creative people. Artists who’ve reported extraordinary experiences of synesthesia range from 19th-century composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov to contemporary artist David Hockney to pop music star Lady Gaga.</p><strong>BORN THIS WAY:</strong> Lady Gaga (above) has said she “hears music all at once and in lots of colors.” Musicians including Jean Sibelius and Duke Ellington have said they’ve experienced synesthesia, which shows up often in creative people, researchers have found.FashionStock.com / Shutterstock<p>For me, the words “Sunday,” “Monday,” and so on, generated internal visions of color and pattern. Most synesthetic reactions also involve color in response to lexical stimuli—words written or spoken (“word-color” synesthesia), and letters, numbers, and symbols (“grapheme-color” synesthesia)—or to music and sound (“colored-hearing” synesthesia). Researchers have also observed dozens of other types of stimulus-reaction combinations: taste evoking a visual image, such as the flavor of chicken producing a 3-D shape; physical touch inducing the sensation of smell; and somehow the most extraordinary pairing, words generating the sensation of taste, such as “jail” creating the flavor of bacon.</p><p>At one time, strange pairings like these were little understood and even feared as signs of pathology. Now we know more, but many questions remain and synesthesia still carries an exotic aura. At the same time, it is a new tool to explore the human brain and mind, creativity, and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Reports of sensory cross-connections go far back. In 1690, the English philosopher John Locke wrote of a blind man who associated the sound of a trumpet with the color scarlet, although it is unclear if this was synesthesia or a metaphor, a recurring issue in synesthesia research. In 1812, however, a German physician wrote a definitive description of seeing colored letters. Other physicians reported similar experiences in patients and the reports drew attention from scientists, clinicians, and artists. French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire extolled the romantic idea that the senses should intermingle.</p><p>But 19th-century scientific and clinical understanding was limited, and synesthetes were often reluctant to come out of the closet for fear of appearing “odd” or worse. Some synesthetes were diagnosed with conditions such as schizophrenia when their cross-sensory effects were taken as delusions or hallucinations. Or clinicians denied that synesthesia existed, interpreting patient’s statements like this “music looks red” as over-enthusiastic metaphor.</p><p>“When I see equations, I see the letters in colors,” Richard Feynman said.</p> <p>Fortunately the scientific study of synesthesia grew from the late 19th century into the 20th, mainly using interviews and group surveys. In 1895, psychologist Mary Whiton Calkins at Wellesley College analyzed her students’ self-reported responses about synesthetic manifestations and speculated about their causes. But like every other scientist at the time, she had no way to probe the phenomenon at a deep neural level. Nevertheless, research continued and led to several international conferences on the subject in the 1930s.</p><p>But by then, research had diminished. One problem was the difficulty of tracking the many forms of synesthesia. Another is the same reason that human consciousness is hard to study—the synesthetic experience is internal and subjective. It’s problematic to analyze a neural event when the only evidence is the subject’s personal account. The entire field of psychology recognized this in that same era when it turned away from studying internal experiences.</p><p>In the 1980s, however, new approaches made synesthesia amenable to more rigorous and objective study and research has blossomed, with about 1,000 new publications since 2000. One big step has been the acceptance of a consensus definition of synesthesia. Its key features are that a subject involuntarily experiences vivid responses to stimuli that combine two or more different sensory modalities, and that the responses are constant over time; for instance, a given word always induces the same color in a particular subject (the colors themselves are unique to each person). The psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen and colleagues introduced this last benchmark in 1987 as an objectively measurable standard of genuineness. True synesthetes give the same responses to the same stimuli when tested and retested over long time intervals. Childhood synesthesia generally continues into adulthood, though not always. I lost my automatic color associations by the time I was 12. Today I can only remember the colors. (You can check yourself <a href="https://www.synesthete.org/" target="_blank">online</a> for evidence of synesthesia.)</p><p>Besides these tests, new neuroimaging techniques have established synesthesia as a real neurological process. One widely used method is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain. Unlike regular MRI, which shows the anatomy of the brain (or other internal organs), fMRI identifies which parts of the brain are active, nearly in real time. Since 2002, some fMRI investigations of grapheme-color synesthesia—the most widely studied kind—have shown that graphemes stimulate the V4 region of the brain. This area deals specifically with color within the visual cortex, the part of the brain that processes what the eyes see (the auditory cortex and other specialized areas handle the remaining senses). This is consistent with a model where the regions of the brain that analyze graphemes and that deal with color are somehow hyper-connected to create a synesthetic event. But not all fMRI data show the same result, nor is it clear if it is the visual perception of a grapheme or its conceptual meaning that is the trigger.1</p><p>Remarkably, even with advanced methods, other basic questions have lingered since the 19th century. How prevalent is synesthesia in the general populace? Different studies had given values from over 20 percent to less than 1 percent, a disparity partly due to the use of self-reported data. To remedy this, in 2006 Simner, then at the University of Edinburgh, and her colleagues carried out a controlled approach. They interviewed nearly 1,700 subjects and tested them for consistency over time. The certified synesthetes constituted 4.4 percent of the group, 1 for every 23 people—rare, but not vanishingly so. The data also showed that the most common subvariant is the one I experienced: colored days of the week.</p><p></p><p>Surveys and tests illuminate possible connections between synesthesia and artistic or creative ability. Catherine Mulvenna at University College London, who has written about this elusive connection, asks, Is synesthesia “a driving force or a mere idiosyncratic quirk” in artists? As Mulvenna points out, one connection of synesthesia with creativity is personal testimony from creative people. This often comes across as compelling evidence of true synesthesia. Vladimir Nabokov wrote in his autobiography <i>Speak, Memory</i> of his “colored hearing,” in which the letters x and k are respectively a steely blue and a huckleberry blue. Richard Feynman has related, “When I see equations, I see the letters in colors … light-tan j’s, slightly violet-bluish n’s, and dark brown x’s flying around.” Hockney sees colors when he hears music, which he uses when he does stage design for ballets and operas.</p><p>Many people with musical talent give detailed accounts of how music makes colors for them. Besides Rimsky-Korsakov, Jean Sibelius feared mockery for revealing his synesthesia, as did violinist Itzhak Perlman. In the worlds of jazz and popular music, Duke Ellington sensed both colors and textures from music, seeing dark blue burlap or light blue satin for specific notes played by certain musicians; the late jazz pianist Marian McPartland saw the key of D as daffodil yellow and B major as maroon; and Lady Gaga said in an interview, “I do hear music all at once and in lots of colors. It’s like a painting.”</p><p>Synesthetes were diagnosed as schizophrenics and suffering from delusions.</p> <p>Research supports these accounts. Self-reported synesthetes appear at a relatively high rate among artistic types, and one study using objective testing found 7 percent synesthetes among 99 art students compared to 2 percent in a control group. There is also evidence of associations between synesthesia and elements of creativity, but one stumbling block is the lack of a satisfactory definition of creativity. As Mulvenna writes, “Creativity is a complex construct to define, almost to the point of infamy within fields of systematic investigation.”</p><p>Nevertheless, researchers have uncovered suggestive correlations between synesthesia and creativity, at least as defined by psychological testing. In 2016, Charlotte Chun and Jean-Michel Hupe at the University of Toulouse, compared a selected group of 29 artistic synesthetes to 36 controls. Testing for aspects of creativity and related abilities such as mental imagery showed higher scores for the synesthetes, but with smaller differences than in earlier studies. These outcomes and other research results point to qualities that synesthetes consistently display, which may explain their creative tendencies: cognitive traits such as a disposition to think in images and sensitivity to color; and the psychological personality trait called “openness to experience,” exemplified by intellectual curiosity and an active imagination.</p><p></p><p>Examining the synesthesia-creativity link is an important long-term effort, but there is a deeper question for synesthesia itself: What are its roots? In 2018, neuroscientists Simon Fisher and Amanda Tilot at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and colleagues published genetic data for synesthetes from three unrelated families where the condition is prevalent.2 Earlier work had not found individual genes that are responsible for synesthesia, but the new researchers cast a wide net. They obtained DNA from four to five synesthetes and at least one nonsynesthete from each family, spread over generations. All the synesthetes displayed the colored-hearing variant called “sound-color.”</p><p>Using gene sequencing, the researchers identified 37 genes that indicate a tendency toward synesthesia. No single gene was seen in all three families, confirming that the inheritance of synesthesia is not tied to just one gene or group of them. But 6 of the 37 genes were linked to the development of axons, the long thin part of a neuron that communicates with other brain neurons through electrical impulses. Equally intriguing, the six genes are also linked to the early childhood development of the visual and auditory cortices, and the parietal cortex, the “association area” of the brain that integrates information across sensory modes for effective overall functioning.</p><p>Synesthesia researchers have entered the final frontier of brain studies: consciousness.</p> <p>Since then, Fisher and Tilot have extended their new genetic understanding to study links between synesthesia and other neural conditions.3 The genetic results and these overlaps are important because, as Fisher told me in an email, they “give us insights into shared neurobiological mechanisms … increasing our understanding of how synesthesia develops.” The genetic links to the development of the sensory cortices of the brain, along with fMRI brain scanning results, seem to support a theory based on hyper-connectivity among brain regions as a basis for synesthesia. More complete genetic data may also ultimately show why the synesthesia genes have survived the evolutionary process, perhaps because they offer adaptive advantages such as seeding creativity.</p><p>Synesthesia researchers have now entered the final frontier of brain studies: consciousness. They believe a new understanding of synesthesia can help solve the hard problem of how subjective experience can arise from the physical brain. Myrto Mylopoulos, a philosopher of mind at Carleton University in Canada, and Tony Ro, a neuroscientist at the City University of New York, have written that synesthesia research can broadly test theories of consciousness because the varied forms of synesthesia involve all the senses and cognitive elements.4 The authors with other researchers believe that the empirical approach to finding or confirming a theory of consciousness is to examine its neural correlates, the objectively testable brain functions that must accompany subjective experiences.</p><p>Pursuing this idea, Mylopoulos and Ro considered how synesthesia can act as a test bed to choose among theories of consciousness, and examined prevalent candidates, none of which is as yet supported by much empirical evidence. “Higher order” theory assumes that conscious states are those that a person is aware of being in, which comes from another mental state operating at a higher level; but in “first-order” theory there is no need for a higher state because even a perceptual state such as viewing a flower is considered to be a conscious state. Significantly, these differences produce characteristic neural correlates operating in different parts of the brain for each theory. The authors conclude that the scope of synesthetic events spread over the brain and its functions can yield “initial clues as to the neural correlates of conscious perceptual experiences more generally,” and help guide researchers toward a valid theory of consciousness.</p><p>As for me, I miss seeing the vivid colors of the days of the week that once enriched my internal vision. The colors now exist only in memory. But I would like to believe that synesthesia’s link to creativity has enlarged my own mind, especially in my career-long devotion as a scientist and writer to interdisciplinary work. Even under strict scientific study, and centuries after its first observations, synesthesia retains its power to make ordinary life both more marvelous and complex.</p><p></p><p><i>Sidney Perkowitz is Candler Professor of Physics Emeritus at Emory University.

But it is more than that. </p><p>Children under 12, for example, are ineligible for vaccination, yet surprisingly susceptible to the Delta variant. Many immunocompromised adults also cannot be vaccinated, or remain highly vulnerable to infection even when fully vaccinated. And breakthrough cases among even the fully vaccinated have increased sharply with the spread of Delta.</p><p>These developments have spawned calls for vaccine passports—proof of vaccination for group gatherings in enclosed spaces. Many have denounced any such requirement as a violation of their rights, without specifying exactly what those rights are or explaining why society should enforce them.</p><p>Vaccine passports don’t raise novel or complex issues.</p> <p>People want to do what they want to do, which helps explain the popularity of slogans about individual rights and freedoms. But rights are costly to define and enforce, and having more liberty along some dimensions often means having less along others. It therefore behooves us to think carefully about which freedoms we value most highly and which rights are most worth defending. These choices are better guided by careful assessment of the relevant costs and benefits than by simple slogans about freedom.</p><p>Does requiring vaccine passports violate any individual rights that a well-functioning society would choose to defend? I will consider this question within a framework that is deeply hostile to regulation and therefore biased against the requirement—the framework outlined by the 19th-century British philosopher and political economist John Stuart Mill. Mill is rightly celebrated as one of history’s most eloquent champions of individual liberty. Among the very substantial proportion of the current U.S. population that remains open to rational deliberation, even the staunchest opponents of government regulation will be prepared to accept the legitimacy of any restriction that passes muster within Mill’s framework. My claim is that vaccine passports clearly meet that test.</p><p>In one of the most widely quoted passages from his 1859 treatise, <i>On Liberty</i>, Mill wrote, </p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;">…the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. </p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;">He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right… The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.</p><p>Mill’s advocacy of his harm principle sprang from his respect for individual autonomy, from his belief that although we might often err, we ourselves are far better than others to chart the course of our own lives. But if Mill been writing as a 21st-century behavioral scientist, he might have embraced a less narrow interpretation of his harm principle. For as is now well documented, we are broadly aware that our own choices sometimes serve us poorly. Shortsightedness, for example, leads many to accept enormous future costs in return for trivial current benefits, choices that we later regret. The 60-year-old who is dying from a radiation-induced cancer may wish that it hadn’t been legal for his 20-year-old self to have accepted employment as a cleanup worker at a radiation spill. An appreciation of the strength and ubiquity of this present bias might have persuaded Mill that the 60-year-old self was in fact harmed by his very different 20-year-old self’s choice.</p><p>Fortunately, the question of whether Mill’s harm principle should apply to vaccine passports doesn’t require a judgment about whether such indirect paternalism is ever permissible. A passport requirement would clearly prevent contemporaneous harm to other people, not just later versions of ourselves. It would substantially reduce the frequency of COVID-19 transmission. It would protect others against serious illness, hospitalization, and death. It would prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. It would accelerate the rate at which normal activity could resume. That vaccine passports would prevent enormous direct harm to others is simply beyond question.</p><p>Mill’s harm principle is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for regulation. Showing that vaccine passports would prevent substantial harm to others does not prove that they should be required. After all, many actions cause significant harm to others, yet are permitted because available alternatives would cause even greater harm. </p><p>A case in point: The late advice columnist Ann Landers described a letter from a man who felt guilty about an act of cruelty he had committed decades earlier as a high school student. He and some friends called a classmate one evening to announce that she had been voted the ugliest girl in their senior class. The girl’s anguished cry as she hung up the phone had haunted the man ever since. The harm to the recipient of this call clearly outweighed whatever entertainment it afforded the callers, even neglecting their subsequent feelings of remorse. Yet the callers did not break any law or violate any regulation. That’s because the right to speak freely has enormous value, even though in some cases it causes far more harm than good. If we could craft speech laws that could discriminate perfectly between cases, we would. But we cannot. </p><p>With such concerns in mind, we should ask whether vaccine passports might entail negative consequences that could outweigh the obvious harms they would prevent. One obvious example is that vaccine passports would be certain to trigger the ire of those who see them as an infringement of their rights. But against those sentiments we would need to weigh the resentment kindled in others who would see that resumption of normal life has been impeded by antivaxxers. And since the second group is so much larger than the first (70 percent of all eligible Americans have now had at least one vaccine dose), the net effect of these opposing concerns would be to reinforce the case for vaccine passports.</p><p>We should also ask whether requiring vaccine passports would actually achieve the desired results. Counterfeiting is the most obvious concern. Businesses that currently demand proof of vaccination from customers or employees now rely on the small white cards people are given when they receive their shots. Accounts of online <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/vaccine-passports-benefits-challenges-and-ethical-concerns" target="_blank">auctions for forgeries</a> of these cards suggest that they may often be an unreliable indicator of vaccine status. </p><p>As international experience <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56522408" target="_blank">suggests</a>, however, this threat is easily parried. The European Union, for example, has introduced vaccine passports—available free of charge in either digital or not-easily-copied paper form—in all 27 member nations, as well as Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. And earlier this year, Israel introduced a vaccine pass that greatly accelerated the reopening of that country’s economy.</p><p>In short, vaccine passports don’t raise novel or complex issues. The U.S. has a long history of requiring evidence of vaccination against childhood illnesses for attendance in public schools. This requirement was met by stiff opposition, to be sure, but here, too, its absence would have generated a far larger volume of resistance. More important, the requirement prevented many needless deaths and serious illnesses, and made possible the virtual elimination of many of the covered illnesses.</p><p>As President Biden appears aware, requiring vaccine passports would generate enormous political pushback. Showing that the requirement clearly satisfies John Stuart Mill’s harm principle will not spur Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rand Paul to lobby in favor of it. But the president’s obligation is to support policies that best serve the interests of all citizens, not just those who press ill-founded claims about individual freedom. Mill’s harm principle, the most freedom-respecting framework we have for thinking about the question, shows clearly that requiring vaccine passports would not violate any individual rights that a well-ordered society would choose to defend. </p><p>And because they would save many lives and speed our return to normal life, we should require them.</p><p><i>Robert H.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18650_8286a932fdc96dc15d69fedad733e501.png'><br><p>We were all very tired. My crew and I had been tracking nautiluses off tiny Ndrova Island in Papua New Guinea for close to a week. Every day we spent 16 hours on small dugout canoes and then got eight hours of fitful sleep on the deck of a Melanesian sea craft. Rice and fresh tuna for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. In the open boats, the sun, the wind, the rain, the dark, all seemed to merge. Time melted in fatigue.</p><p>A week before, we had fitted the nautiluses with acoustic transmitters that gave their position and depth. To track them, we had to stay within a kilometer as they bumped through a muddy habitat near the ocean bottom and climbed up the coral reefs lining the small islands here. We sat above them in small boats and canoes, dangling hydrophones over the side to pick up the faint acoustic signals.</p><strong>CAPTAIN NAUTILUS:</strong> Author Peter Ward holds an Allonautilus aboard an outrigger off Ndrova Island in Papua New Guinea. Ward has been tracking and studying the cephalopod for more than 40 years.Gregory Barord<p>It was 2015 and we were tracking the two different kinds of nautiliuses—Nautilus and its descendent, Allonautilus—found here and virtually nowhere else on Earth. Both varieties were going extinct from overfishing and changing ocean conditions. We wanted to know how they were managing to survive. Could they cross large bodies of water to find sufficient food?</p><p>In 1984, I had done this same kind of work, in exactly this place, but with inferior equipment. Now, 31 years later, my memory jangled. Major changes had occurred. Back then the water was blessedly cool as it rose up reef walls from deep ocean zones. To dive was to escape the heat of this place, a geographic hot spot athwart the equator. Now the rising water, deficient in oxygen and nutrients, was a warm death to the reefs it once sustained.</p><p>In less than a century, climate change has upended conditions that have sustained life in the Mesophotic Zone for millions of years.</p> <p>I was most struck by the absence of sharks. In 1984, we were repeatedly chased from the water. On one occasion, my dive buddy slammed his large camera against the head of an especially aggressive black tip as we scrambled over the transom and into our boat. Not so in 2015. We dived every day for two weeks. We never saw a single shark. Not even a tiny, white-tipped reef shark. I knew where they were. Or at least where their fins were. Hanging in the Thailand, Cambodia, Hong Kong, and mainland Chinese stores by the tens of thousands, waiting to become soup.</p><p>Our transmitters, miracles of miniature electronics that looked like AA batteries (albeit $1,000 each; pretty pricey for AA’s!), picked up the nautiluses as they swam above the bottom of the ocean. Each second, they sent us their position, their depth, and the temperature of the water they were in. They didn’t descend below 800 meters because at that depth the ocean pressure would cause their shells to implode. Our tracking showed they followed the ocean bottom contour toward shallower water, where there was more food, but also more danger. Their predators, sharks and large fish, are visual hunters, so the nautiluses were safer in the darker, deeper depths. At least they once were.</p><p>In 2015, our research brought me a revelation that my colleagues in marine biology and paleontology and I are still sorting out today. Although the nautilus doesn’t face as many predators, whose own hunter, humans, have reduced their numbers, the buoyant, deep-sea organism with the beautiful spiral shell faces a bigger problem. The water temperature in the ocean layer, defined as the Mesophotic Zone, through which the nautilus travels, is growing so warm that it’s destroying the life of all the organisms that thrive there.</p><p>“Canary in the coal mine” has become a hoary environmental saw. But it’s still a useful one. Canaries are more sensitive than humans to increases in carbon dioxide and methane, when combined with lowered oxygen. It was wise for early miners to use the birds to detect when gas accumulations in mines rose to levels that would kill them. The nautilus is the prototypical animal in the Mesophotic Zone. Its survival now foretells the fate of the oceans’ ecological health.</p><p></p><p>The Mesophotic Zone ranges from 100 meters to 500 meters deep, where light, when it penetrates to the bottom, is a dim twilight, even at noon. The animals in this twilight zone share many characteristics, but among the most important is slow growth, leading to extended adolescence, low fecundity once maturity is attained, and long lifespans.</p><p>Because light is so low, the animals, the bony fish, sharks, and many kinds of mobile invertebrates, largely eschew bright color displays. To find food they largely use chemoreception—like a dog hunting for that elusive kibble on a dark floor at night, they can pinpoint food by smell—rather than vision. They all live life in the slow lane, using techniques to jealously guard their energy, given food is often scarce. This is the case with nautilus and another bellwether species, the coelacanth. The coelacanth is a giant blue fish with lobe fins that are a “missing link” to the limbs of the first amphibians, and ultimately our limbs, making the coelacanths our own deep ancestors. But coelacanths still exist, at the depths and sometimes the same localities of nautiluses, true snapshots of bygone geological eras.</p><strong>FINDING NAUTILUS:</strong> In New Guinea, Peter Ward outfitted nautiluses with transmitters to follow the endangered animals as they bobbed through warming layers of the ocean in search of sufficient food.Peter Ward<p>The two animals have come down to us from impossibly long ago. Both first appeared in the fossil record in their present guises about 100 million years ago. (The very first nautiloids appeared 500 million years ago, and the first coelacanth-like fish almost 400 million years ago, based on well dated fossils of each.) Recent studies using oxygen isotopes of their skeletons, and technique that yields temperature of skeletal growth, reveal the nautilus and coelacanth first evolved when they were shallow-water species. But sometime around 60 million years ago, their species migrated down into the Mesophotic Zone, while the fossil record tells us that all those that stayed in the more flourishing shallows went extinct.</p><p>In deep water, both species can live for a very long time, at least a century. A key to their longevity is they evolved to live at extremely low metabolic rates. Nautiluses can bump across the ocean bottoms with almost no energetic effort, using their 90 tentacles to chemically search for that perhaps once-a-month windfall of a dead fish falling down the reef cliff onto their muddy habitat. But their genius is their buoyant shell. They expend virtually no energy in searching for food. Their body plan involves one of the greatest evolutionary trade-offs of all time. Swimming takes energy. Breathing takes energy. For the nautilus, the energy expended for swimming also allows for respiration. The coelacanth has perfected life in the slow lane in a different way. Almost uniquely among animals, their normal position is head down, tail up, perfectly vertical and still. So here we have a 100-million-year-old fish, bright blue, 6 feet long, standing on its head and rarely feeding, like a deep-water Zen master.</p><p>I was most struck by the absence of sharks. In 1984, we were repeatedly chased from the water. Not now.</p> <p>In the past, both species largely subsisted on the food from above, from animals that lived in shallow waters. Plankton and organic-rich sediments tumbled down the long stony walls of coral reefs. The greatest treasures were bodies of animals that sank to the bottom, to be fought over by the animals adapted to search for meat. Neither the nautilus nor coelacanth appear to be predators of live animals. They exploit a scavenging lifestyle instead, the great jackals of the sea.</p><p>Coral reefs are the palaces of the Mesophotic Zone. They thrum with life. Trying to count the number of different species visible on a thriving reef is like trying to count the stars in the sky. A more accurate analogy may be plants in a rainforest, as reefs harbor so many kinds of life.</p><p>Reefs are often and not inaccurately described as “superorganisms.” They are immense, composed of millions of organic parts, and function as conduits taking sunlight and turning it into both plant and animal flesh. The tiny animals making up a coral colony can only exist by keeping a greenhouse full of tiny, photosynthesizing algae deep within its transparent flesh. That goes for the different types of reefs, including barrier reefs, atolls, lagoon reefs, and shallow fringing reefs. They all have anatomical parts that evolved to acquire energy, grow, and for as long as possible, stave off death.</p><p>And they have staved off death for more than 500 million years. If we could enter a souped-up time machine and hire a local airplane to photograph reefs during the geological periods Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous, each of which experienced a mass extinction of organisms, we would find the majestic reefs relatively unchanged.</p><p>Reefs’ resilience is aided by vertical walls. The walls have specific shapes at specific places, on a transect from deep to shallow water. In fact, of all underwater environments, the vertical, stony walls that mark the deep-water edges of coral reefs are among the most sublime, colorful, and ancient of Earth’s biologically produced habitats.</p><p>The deep water in front of coral reefs is normally cold and nutrient-rich. Because cold water contains more oxygen than warmer water, this nutrient- and oxygen-rich resource is as necessary for the life and growth of reef tracts as fresh water and fertilizer are to a garden. What’s more, the perpetual winds of the coral-living latitudes push ocean water in unvarying directions. This causes the deep, cold water to rise into the warmer, often oxygen-deprived surface waters where corals most actively grow. This process is called upwelling and results in the richest fisheries in the world. Along with nourishing coral, it allows for the rich sardine and herring fisheries of western South America, western South Africa, western North Africa, and California.</p><p></p><p>In less than a century, climate change has upended conditions that have sustained life in the Mesophotic Zone for millions of years. Global warming, generated by human activity, has penetrated surface water and caused the water in front of reefs to become lethally warm and anoxic. Our work showed that the same species I studied at this place in 1984 were living and growing in water temperatures 3 to 5 centigrade cooler than now.</p><p>One of nature’s greatest symbiotic partnerships is between coral and a tiny organism called zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae adsorb the coral’s respired carbon dioxide and phosphatic wastes and are in turn protected from predation in the open sea. The corals get a different benefit. Zooxanthellae allow the coral to build gigantic, hard skeletons. But when the oxygen-deprived warm water hits the zooxanthellae, they feel poisoned, and their reaction is to flee. When the zooxanthellae escape their coral hosts, they leave the once colorful coral animal transparent, so that the white calcareous skeleton of the coral is now visible. We call this coral bleaching.</p><p>It is not only the shallow reef being killed by the increasing upwelling of giant “blobs” of the warm water. The entire ecosystem of animals and plants in the once oxygen-rich environments of the Mesophotic Zone is encountering death by poison.</p><strong>TWILIGHT ZONE:</strong> Peter Ward on a dive off the coast of Ndrova Island, just north of Papua New Guinea, the only region on Earth home to the Allonautilus (his left hand) and Nautilus (right hand).Gregory Barord<p>During our work in that hot equatorial visit in 2015, we brought back tiny slivers of nautilus shells for analysis in giant mass spectroscopes. Long gone are the days when we would collect and kill for science. For the past decade, we’ve returned all the nautiluses we caught to the sea. The bits of their shell edges gave us sad evidence of the warming of the Mesophotic Zone.</p><p>More than 80 years ago, the great Chicago chemist Harold Urey discovered the temperature of skeletons in many kinds of invertebrates, including the nautilus, can be determined with mass spectrometry. The instrument measures the fractionation of molecules; in this case, the isotopic composition of oxygen in seawater baked into the nautilus shell. The readings told us the fractionation, a function of temperature, represented significant warming between 1984 and 2015 in the nautilus habitats off Ndrova Island. That suggested the nautilus was moving toward deeper, cooler waters. But depth exacts its own lethal penalty. Higher pressure slows their growth, and slow growth of juveniles has been a death sentence for them.</p><p>We had been put down remote video systems that allowed us to make estimates of population numbers. Nautiluses and Allonautiluses are so efficient in finding the meat in deep-water crab traps, the preferred mode of capture by illegal shell traders, that they have been easy to catch. Traders have reported up to 50 nautiluses on a particularly good haul. That’s led to the assumption that there are millions of these archaic animals crisscrossing the deeps in front of coral reefs. But our estimates are that there might be 10 nautiluses per square kilometer where there is no nautilus trapping, and maybe 1 per kilometer in the Philippines and Indonesia, sites of the most virulent trapping. A square kilometer of ocean bottom is a very large area. That so few nautiluses live in that area, even in the best of circumstances, represents a life on the edge.</p><p>Perhaps if Nautiluses and Allonautiluses only had to survive the warming depths, they would do as they have always done—eke by. If they were only fished by those who can sell a single, freshly killed Allonautilus for $1,000—a sum more than the annual income in the area where they are found—perhaps there would be a world in a thousand years with this iconic animal. But the nautilus and coelacanth are being rapidly killed simply for food by fishing communities in the tropics, whose livelihoods are slowly being destroyed by climate change and overfishing. Like so much in our warming world, the delicate balance of the Mesophotic Zone, and the ancient animals in it, are being crushed by the human thumb of extinction.</p><p></p><p><i>Peter Ward is a professor of biology and Earth and space sciences at the University of Washington.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18656_bf0c0d36a5a3f240ccbc590fca184a7f.png'><br><p>The idea of cryogenically freezing a person to preserve their body until many years into the future has long been a staple of science-fiction stories. However, the need to reliably store biological materials such as cells or tissue is a common concern for scientific research and, increasingly, for society too.</p><p>Whether it’s the dark, suffocating deep sea or the scalding, bubbling thermal pools, life finds a way to call it home. So, it isn’t a surprise that fish living in the freezing cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic could provide the inspiration for a new generation of cryoprotectant molecules.</p><p>The fish, and other cold-temperature extremophiles, produce proteins that can recognize and bind to ice as it is forming, acting like an anti-freeze. Ice crystals can do a lot of damage to the body, from causing proteins to clump together to weakening the structures that hold tissue together.</p><p>It opens up new options. Our cultural imagery of frozenness is about to change.</p> <p>This led Matthew Gibson, a professor of chemistry at Warwick University in the United Kingdom, to attempt to recreate the abilities of ice-binding proteins using synthetic polymers. These have the advantage of being easier to adjust or “tune” to suit their purpose and to manufacture at scale.</p><p>“We can make it a bit more tunable, as you’ve got literally thousands of different monomers you could use to make a polymer,” Gibson says. “Our aim, if we can mimic some of those properties, is to apply these to improve or change how we freeze cells.”</p><p>Through a project called<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/789182" target="_blank"> Cryostem</a>, Gibson tested these polymers by adding them to samples of bone marrow stem cells, which are often frozen when being transported for a transplant. The current system involves adding solvents to protect the cells when freezing. However, it isn’t ideal. A significant proportion of the cells do not survive and the solvent itself can affect them.</p><p>Gibson has been able to show that his<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsabm.0c00638" target="_blank"> polymers can decrease the amount of solvent</a> needed for cryopreservation, reducing the damage done to the cells. This approach could also help biomedical research, allowing scientists to reliably store and thaw a wider range of cells in the laboratory.</p><p>He is now expanding this work through another project,<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/866056" target="_blank"> Ice Pack</a>, to apply cryoprotectant polymers to the growing field of biologic treatments. Traditional pharmaceuticals are typically small molecules that can be put into a tablet form and will be stable in the medicine cabinet for months. Now, more and more of the modern best-selling drugs are proteins, such as antibodies to treat arthritis or cancer, which need to be stored much more carefully.</p><p>More delicate still are cell-based therapies like CAR T cells, which are modified immune cells used to treat cancer. Now, cell-based therapies are rare and expensive, but in the future, they may become more common. “They have quite a complex process, where they’re collected from the donor and then they need modifying, freezing, and shipping,” Gibson says. “Anything you can do to make sure they’re protected as best as they can, or make the cold chain easier, is going to have a big effect on patient outcome.”</p><p>Zoom out from individual proteins or cells and the picture becomes even more complicated. “Ice can form inside and outside the cell,” explains Ilja Voets, a chemical engineer at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. “Depending on where the ice forms, it is disruptive to cellular structures or extra-cellular structures; for example, the extra-cellular matrix in which the cells are embedded.”</p><p>Freezing a person to preserve their body has long been a staple of science-fiction stories.</p> <p>The challenge of freezing samples of tissue is another area where analogues of ice-binding proteins could help. Working with the<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001965" target="_blank"> Protect</a> project, Voets is particularly interested in the freezing and thawing of heart cells and tissue. Currently, only about half of the cells are usable after freezing when studying cultures in the laboratory. This becomes even more difficult when studying tissue samples.</p><p>Typically, in heart cells, Voets explains, “the preservation conditions are optimal for one cell type, but not for the other types, or not for the tissue as a whole.” It is a big challenge but the ice-binding protein analogues don’t have to preserve the tissue perfectly to be useful. “There’s a very strong regenerative ability of tissues. So in some cases, if the damage is modest, then the tissue can repair itself and it can still be used.”</p><p>Voets is using high-resolution microscopy to understand how different types of ice-binding protein analogues are able to prevent ice formation. This will help to create improved versions that can reduce freeze injury to tissue. The potential to reliably bank your own tissue samples, to be thawed if needed in the future, is “one of the ultimate dreams,” Voets says.</p><p>“Say someone has an infarct [a region of dead cells]. You will be able to transplant heart tissue from that very specific patient because you have banked it. That’ll be fantastic, and it could lower the risk of rejection as well. There’s a lot of things that we could gain from being able to bank more types of cells and tissues.”</p><p>Advances in cryopreservation are already making an impact on society. Some companies offer egg-freezing services as a perk to employees who want to delay having a child. This essentially defers the decision-making of how to align the competing needs of professional advancement and childcare, says Thomas Lemke, a professor of sociology, who focuses on biotechnology, at Goethe University in Germany. “This is what is often called a technological fix for a societal problem,” he says.</p><p>This technological fix places further burden on the individual to adapt so that society doesn’t need to change. Lemke says there is a real danger that it could become a societal expectation. Cryopreservation could become the ultimate insurance policy. Private companies already offer banking for umbilical cord blood, which is rich in stem cells. Perhaps in the future, we will also be able to bank heart tissue.</p><p>Lemke is studying the societal impacts of this “suspended life,” as he calls it, through the research project,<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/788196" target="_blank"> Cryosocieties</a>. He is examining how cryopreservation practices have developed and how they influence our decision-making. Whereas societies have often associated coldness with death, cryopreservation creates new opportunities from medical care to biodiversity.</p><p>“It’s no longer the state of non-transformation, of remaining inert. But rather, it mobilizes things and opens up options,” Lemke says. “Our cultural imagery of frozenness is about to change.”</p><p></p><p><i>Ian Le Guillou is a freelance science writer based in Paris, France.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18660_5dbf1b07990a76375db518236bc93f06.png'><br><p>Last month, having returned to Earth aboard his Blue Origin spacecraft, Jeffrey Bezos, the chairman of Amazon and, as of this month, the richest person alive with over $200 billion, made an awkward show of gratitude. On stage at a press conference in Van Horn, Texas, sitting alongside the ship’s three other passengers, Bezos, wearing a pretentious cowboy hat, said he wanted to thank every Amazon employee and customer because, “You guys paid for all of this.”</p><p>The immediate reaction from the audience and Bezos’ co-“astronauts” was a kind of perfunctory laughter. They all seemed to think he must be joking, or at least couldn’t be serious. Even Wally Funk, the 82-year-old aviator sitting to Bezos’ left, rolled her eyes and opened her mouth tall in faux amusement. The backlash, from pundits and elected officials, was rapid. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, on Twitter, “Yes, Amazon workers did pay for this—with lower wages, union busting, a frenzied and inhumane workplace, and delivery drivers not having health insurance during a pandemic.”</p><p>For Paul Hooper, an evolutionary anthropologist, the indignant reactions to Bezos’ gesture of humility illustrates a sort of social paradox in American society. “We’re a highly stratified society. It’s clear that we have classes,” Hooper said. “Yet we also have a competitive humility that goes on even with really famous and really rich people. They are asked to present a modicum of virtue that the chimpanzee alpha does not care about. We maintain this constant negotiation of not only where we stand, but how we should stand with respect to each other. That’s rife through our social life at all scales.”</p><strong>HUMAN POSSIBILITIES:</strong> Paul Hooper spent time among nomads in different countries to better grasp the fundamental principles that govern human societies. “You start to get a sense of the broad variation that’s possible in terms of human behavior and human social organization,” he said.Courtesy of Paul Hooper<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01059-y#Equ15" target="_blank">paper</a> in <i>Nature Human Behavior</i>, Hooper explains how egalitarianism—a culture of resistance against unequal treatment and opportunity—can evolve in a society and stay strong. Becoming a truly egalitarian society would mean, for example, curtailing vast disparities in wealth and other resources, so that the pursuit of happiness isn’t so skewed in favor of the few. When I asked Hooper if he saw the backlash to Bezos as egalitarianism in action, he said, “Absolutely. The way that people react to that kind of thing is exactly what I’m talking about.”</p><p>Hooper is a senior researcher at the Economic Science Institute at Chapman University, and studies, among other things, what drives wealth inequality and egalitarianism.* He started out studying history and loved learning about the Mongol Empire, but got frustrated that historians didn’t have the tools that he wanted to use to investigate how human society works scientifically. Now, he says, he’s helping to modernize anthropology into a discipline that’s more “computational,” involving a mix of theoretical modeling and statistics.</p><p>In our conversation, over Zoom, he considered his words carefully, fixing his gaze away from the camera for stretches at a time to ponder his response. This fit with the patient, inquisitive, analytic demeanor of someone who conducted ethnographic fieldwork in places like Bolivia, Mongolia, and Siberia to challenge his own assumptions about what human societies can be like. I brought up Bezos, and then asked Hooper to explain what, at bottom, fuels the possibility of egalitarianism in the first place, beginning with how he defines the term.</p><p></p><p><b>Was the backlash against Jeff Bezos’ recent show of “gratitude” for his Amazon employees a sign that egalitarianism is strong in our culture?</b></p><p>I think that, while on the face of it, the inequalities are increasing, that’s likely to increase the demand for egalitarian behavior. It’s not letting dominance pass you by, but saying, “I’m actually going to do something about this.” So, the very fact that it’s getting worse may create the conditions for it to swing the other way. If you can affect the importance of cooperation, and if you can affect who has to cooperate with whom, then as long as the push is big enough, it should have an effect. With the dominants, the rich—you need to wire them up to everybody else, because then everybody else can have an influence on them and say, “Whoa, Mr. Big Shot.” Then they start to feel bad. They start to realize they’re losing friends. If the dominants or the rich or the elites are up in their fortresses, then there’s no room for any of this.</p><p><b>Have community and social capital been too de-emphasized in our vision of what a desirable lifestyle looks like?</b></p><p>Yes, in a way that has made us vulnerable. Many of us are drawn into a jet-setting sort of lifestyle, where we go to college in one place and get a job for a few years in another. There’s a real loss of place and people that I’ve seen that I think is at the heart of a lot of the egalitarian actions that we try to model. If we can pay as much attention to our social capital as our material capital, that would put us in a position to be happier and more equal.</p><p>I feel like there’s untapped creative potential in determining the nature of our own society.</p> <p><b>What did you learn about egalitarianism living among people in Siberia and Mongolia?</b></p><p>One thing that piqued my interest when I was in Siberia and Mongolia was the radically different notions of property rights among nomads. I grew up mostly in Colorado and New Mexico. We have this feeling of open fields and blue skies and freedom. Going to Mongolia, where people had been basically ranchers and cowboys for 6,000 years now, and there’s no fences, and the animals and people know where to go, was striking. Some of my stereotypes about nomads were false. The idea that there’s no fixed pattern, or people just wander and go wherever the grass is. In particular ecologies, there’s quite real property rights in the sense that: “This is our camp, and we’re going to be here next year, and nobody else who knows what they’re doing is going to come camp there out of respect for us and our family and our place in the community.” It doesn’t come down to a deed or a title. It’s a matter of community regulation—who has the right to claim what—and for the most part it’s a functional system. It’s what they’ve been doing for long before anybody showed up and tried to introduce taxation. Those are the kinds of things that get me excited.</p><p><b>What are the things that lead society into a stark dominance hierarchy?</b></p><p>The best predictor of dominance hierarchies in which it’s clear who’s on top and who’s on bottom is the existence of concentrated, clumped resources that are efficient to defend. Essentially the first six pristine civilizations formed where there was extremely concentrated, high-productivity agricultural soil. That provided the nucleus, the birthplace for those highly unequal, larger-scale systems to grow.</p><p>The coastal sites that Native Americans inhabited were also so productive and defensible that you ended up seeing these large-scale towns defended with walls and small-scale armies. You go a few hundred miles inland, and the resources are plants scattered more widely, or game that’s moving around, and you don’t see anything like that. You see small settlements and little benefit to saying, “This is my patch.” Because, claim it now, and the animals are just going to leave.</p><p>Groups that don’t have strong private property norms—where if you’re using something, you have a right to it, and once you stop using it, then somebody else can step in—don’t breed the kind of inequality that happens if you own a particular patch of agricultural soil year after year, and you always have the productivity that comes off of it.</p><p><b>So, if resources are hard to defend, that guards against domineering inequality. What else helps to guard against that?</b></p><p>There’s been an argument that, as humans developed the use of tools that we hold in our hands and use to kill animals, we started to also use those to kill other human beings. That, the argument goes, actually levels the playing field in terms of fighting ability, and increases the cost of fighting for everybody. These are the costs of competition.</p><p>Think about wrestling versus getting stabbed. Whenever you expect to get hurt, you’ll do less of that thing. Leveling coalitions basically stand up to dominants and punish them when they’re aggressive. We specifically focus on retaliating against the dominant by saying, “I refuse to cooperate with you.” You can also get levelers that say, “I’m not going to start any fights, but if you fight me, I’m going to fight you back.”</p><p>That’s another strategy we talk about in the model, and that can do something similar. Gains to cooperation are the benefits that you get from cooperating with somebody. It’s: “How beneficial are your friends to you? How much is their friendship worth to you in evolutionary currency?”</p><p><b>What hasn’t been done before, you say, is combining these factors into a single “evolutionary model.” What do you mean by that?</b></p><p>It’s a mathematical model we use to ask, “Given a set of assumptions and given particular environmental conditions, if natural selection were to act on a population, what would the result be?”</p><p><b>Part of what’s new in your work is the way you marry a couple of popular games—hawk-dove and the prisoner’s dilemma—to create your model. How do they work?</b></p><p>Hawk-dove is a game of whether to be aggressive or dominant, or not. When there’s a resource that can either be shared or fought over, hawks fight over it and doves share it. Hawks, when they encounter doves, take the whole thing. It’s the classic game to represent animal dominance interactions. We chose to use it in this model to represent those behaviors—like stealing from someone, or taking their spot, or beating them up—that seem to be remarkably absent in egalitarian hunter-gatherers and other groups. We wanted to say, “What would make you go from a situation where you had a good number of people in the population who are willing to be aggressive, to a situation in which hardly anyone is willing to be aggressive, because they know it’s in their best interest to not be a jerk?”</p><p>The prisoner’s dilemma is the classic representation of a cooperation game where, by cooperating, two individuals are able to generate more resources than they generate on their own. But there’s a temptation to defect, or free ride. So, cooperation should not evolve in a prisoner’s dilemma unless there’s some special conditions, like an opportunity for repeated interaction or relatedness between the players. So it was a way for us to represent this dimension of cooperation that in the hunter-gatherer context would amount to something like food sharing or cooperative hunting.</p><p>The very fact that inequality is getting worse may create the conditions for it to swing the other way.</p> <p><b>Why combine hawk-dove and prisoner’s dilemma in a single evolutionary model?</b></p><p>We had an inkling that this could be key to explaining the lack of aggressive behavior: Can one game end up having a spillover effect on the other game and end up squashing dominance?</p><p><b>So, what happens in the evolutionary model when you press “go,” so to speak?</b></p><p>I always like a very pessimistic starting point: Let’s assume everybody’s a hawk and nobody’s cooperating. It’s a Hobbesian, shitty world. Then you ask: Under what conditions does that population evolve to go someplace else entirely different? The absolute key is the net benefits of cooperation, if those outweigh the short-term benefits of aggression.</p><p>What happens in the model is new strategies arise through mutation. Suddenly, out of nowhere, we have a leveler, a mutant baby. And the question is: Does the leveler succeed evolutionarily and increase in the population, or are they snuffed out immediately?</p><p>As long as the benefits of dominance are less than the benefits of cooperation, then it’s actually in the dominant’s interest, when they encounter the leveler, to give in, basically, because the leveler, on its first turn after someone plays hawk on it, will be like, “No. I’m a leveler and you played hawk. I’m never going to cooperate with you unless you play dove.”</p><p>If the balance is correct, then it’s in the interest of the dominant to take heed and say to the leveler, “I’d rather have the benefits of cooperation than just to take your stuff today, so I’m going to start playing dove.” The same conditions that make it worth being a leveler also make it worth paying attention to a leveler, because that benefit of cooperation is out there, and as long as it’s valuable enough, it’ll drive someone to say, “I’m going to put away my bullying because I’d rather get the benefits of playing along,” essentially.</p><p><b>What does the model end up predicting about cooperation and egalitarianism?</b></p><p>What it predicts is that more equal conditions arise because of the importance of cooperation. Any time that there’s dominance interactions and cooperation, it’s not just any old circumstance that we expect levelers to be able to create more equality. It’s specifically only when the net benefit of cooperation, the extra resources that we generate by working together, is greater than what you would get by being aggressive that levelers can invade and cause it to become more equal.</p><p><b>Would you characterize modern society as more of an egalitarian situation, or some kind of dominance hierarchy?</b></p><p>Given the institutional protections of civil liberties that have evolved in the past two centuries, there’s a lot of scope for egalitarian living nested within the context of a larger society. There’s ways, particularly in our face-to-face interactions with our peers and the people that we choose to interact with, that we replicate a lot of the egalitarian practices that you see in hunter-gatherer societies.</p><p>The ǃKung people of Southern Africa, for example, consciously avoid bragging. It would be considered rude for you, if you were a hunter, to walk back into camp with a kill on your back and say, “I killed this,” and give it to everyone else. What they end up doing is dropping the carcass off about 20 feet away from camp and walking in as if they got nothing. Somebody else from the camp will retrieve the animal and bring it in and start distributing it. It’s almost a competitive humility.</p><p>At the macro level, today’s reliance on capital is a ramped-up version of what we see with earlier agricultural societies, except the scale of the system and its productivity, and so its capacity for inequality, dwarfs that of the agricultural period. The distribution and size of firms has gone up over the past century, and that’s been a part of a process of consolidation and movement of wealth concurrent with increases in inequality and distribution of that capital. With few exceptions, most of us are living in really unequal countries in terms of distribution of income and capital. We’re a highly stratified society.</p><p>The benefit of cooperation is there. If it’s valuable enough, someone will say, “I’m going to put away my bullying because I’d rather get the benefits of playing along.”</p> <p><b>Why do you say that it’s of great societal interest to understand how egalitarianism, an active suppression of dominance, can get off the ground?</b></p><p>We know how harmful inequality can be, and we know it’s been steadily on the rise, maybe since the ’50s. It’s at record-high levels, and we see it manifesting in measurable ways that are real and they show up in the news. It’s clear that we have classes. That manifests in so many different ways, not only directly, in terms of what resources people have access to, but also gradients in health and mental well being. All of the material inequality ends up manifesting in terms of embodied inequality. If we had a better theory to understand what leads to more inequality, and especially what leads to less inequality, I think it could alleviate some real human suffering.</p><a title="Italic" class="redactor_btn_italic" tabindex="-1" target="_blank"></a><p><b>How do we embody inequality?</b></p><p>As an example, we can think about income and neighborhood in urban settings, like Denver or San Francisco. When you’re facing low income, no savings or capital, and barriers to accessing health care and nutritional food, it ends up creating wealth gradients of, for example, metabolic syndrome and Type II diabetes. Last year, the best predictor of mortality in COVID-19 was diabetes. A good proportion of the differential mortality for low-income folks along racial lines is downstream of this economic gradient of chronic disease.</p><p><b>How hard is it to bring about egalitarianism?</b></p><p>While the space for egalitarianism to arise is substantial, it’s much smaller than the space where it can’t arise, because it’s rare in nature, probably in the universe, to have really high benefits of cooperation. It takes special circumstances. Humans happen to be super cooperative, and that puts us more squarely in that space more often.</p><p><b>It requires cultural evolution, right?</b></p><p>Yes. It’s going to manifest as a culture of humility or a culture of resistance, a culture of calling out the rulers for their injustices. We see that through all of history. Now we’re able to start to use mathematics to understand it in a more analytical way, but it’s a very old idea. I go back and forth between feeling like, “This is happening all around us,” versus, “This happens once in a blue moon.” It’s kind of how politically pessimistic or optimistic I’m feeling.</p><p><b>How are you feeling now?</b></p><p>I feel hopeless at the macro level. But still I feel like there’s untapped creative potential in determining the nature of our own society. Everything in this model works because of social action, because one strategy imposes constraints on the whole rest of the society, and then the society changes. We see radical, enormous shifts in social norms and institutions through history. I know that we haven’t explored all of the possibility space yet. If we could tap that potential, and we could make egalitarianism essentially truly a self-perpetuating cultural unit that also preserves itself, then it’ll stay around. It’ll be a new kind of society. The math points to those possibilities, so I’m not entirely pessimistic. There’s amazing untapped potential that comes down to face-to-face relationships that endure over time.</p><p></p><p><i>Brian Gallagher is an associate editor at</i> Nautilus. <i>Follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/bsgallagher" target="_blank">@bsgallagher.</a></i></p><p><i>Lead image: Hyejin Kang / Shutterstock</i></p><p><i>* This article originally stated that Paul Hooper currently serves as the Santa Fe Institute&#8217;s director of education.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18646_837d74cd0d4fbc51ead6d12738e01cba.jpg'><br><p><i>It turned out that, yes, the participants’ brains revealed they were doing a kind of “neural replay” of the game they had been manipulated to win.</i>Illustration by Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock</p><p>During this Olympics, I’ve been rooting for Kelleigh Ryan, who is on the women’s foil team. She’s from Ottawa, where I live. Whenever she scored a point, she’d emit a victory scream, probably feeling a rush of pleasure. Watching her on television, I did, too.</p><p>Getting better at something involves emotion. When we do well, we have good feelings—pride, pleasure, excitement—and these emotions help reinforce whatever behaviors we just engaged in. Similarly, the pain of failure makes recent behaviors less likely in the future. This is conditioning, and we’ve all experienced it—when we’re awake. But what about when we sleep?</p><p>These rehearsals might not even be conscious!</p>
<p>Sleep reinforces memories. We know this because after half an hour of sleep, people can remember things better than when they spend half an hour doing something else, like watching TV. Studies of rats <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1825" target="_blank">show</a> that their brains rehearse running through mazes while they sleep, in a process known as sleep replay. Memory’s function is to store information that will be useful. Because of this, our mind prioritizes remembering some things over others. Studies have <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-14184-001" target="_blank">shown</a>, for example, that it’s easier to remember things that are useful for survival. Might sleep similarly focus on things that are particularly good or bad for us, like food and dangerous animals, and ignore things that are irrelevant to our well-being, like the exact shape of a cloud?</p><p>A recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24357-5" target="_blank">study</a> by the University of Geneva’s Virginie Sterpenich and colleagues tried to find out. They had subjects play two computer games, which were designed to be engaging and to use two very different brain areas. One game involved picking a target face out of a set of 18, and the other game involved navigating through a Duke Nukem-derived 3D maze. The face game players use areas of the brain specializing in recognizing faces—the fusiform and occipital face areas. The maze game players use the parahippocampal place areas, grey matter regions that compute scene recognition and memory. The subjects did both of these tasks while Sterpenich and her team scanned their brains using both an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures electrical activity over time, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which provides information about what parts of the brain are active by measuring the amount of blood flow happening all over the brain. </p><p>What the subjects didn’t know is that the games were rigged. The players only won one of the games, but thought that their winning and losing was a result of their performance. If our brains are more likely to rehearse things they are rewarded for, then, when sleeping, they should rehearse the game they won more often than the game they lost. After the games were over, the participants went to sleep in a brain scanner. The researchers used an AI trained on the EEG and fMRI data to recognize which game was being played while awake, to decode the sleeping players’ brain scans and see if they were thinking about one game or the other during sleep. (Once the AI learns how to identify a task in somebody who is awake—when scientists know what task they’re doing—they can apply it to the brain activity observed during sleep and see which task the players’ brain scans most resembles.)</p><p>It turned out that, yes, the participants’ brains revealed they were doing a kind of “neural replay” of the game they had been manipulated to win. If you had been one of the players who won the face game, then you would have been more likely to have replayed the face game during sleep (compared to the maze game that you lost). The reward you felt after “winning” the face game made a neural replay of it more likely to arise in your sleep. Not only did the detector identify this, but the brain areas associated with the rewarded games (face or space areas) were preferentially active.</p><p>This suggests that our minds are rehearsing things during sleep and that they preferentially feature things that are good for us over experiences that don’t matter to us. Does this have anything to do with dreaming? Well, none of the participants entered rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, which is when most dreams happen, during their time in the sleep lab. (REM tends to happen later in the night.) The neural replay happened only during slow-wave sleep, when dreams tend to be infrequent, dull, and go unremembered. The participants might not even have been aware of the rehearsal their brains were engaged in. These rehearsals might not even be conscious!</p><p>Other evidence <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/did-ancestral-humans-dream-for-their-lives/D31EF7CC5A54FF4567C8CFCBE8F1790E" target="_blank">suggests</a> that dreaming during REM sleep tends to be more negative—bad dreams are more common than good ones. This leads to the interesting idea that positive experiences are rehearsed during non-REM sleep, and negative ones are rehearsed during REM sleep.</p><p>I can’t help but think that Keilleigh’s victory scream enhanced her pleasure at scoring her points. It’s interesting to think that it made her more likely to rehearse fencing that night, when her adrenaline calmed down and she was ready to sleep. She got beaten in the quarter final, by Larisa Korobeynikova, from Russia. She didn’t medal, but tonight her brain might be preparing for the next challenge.</p><p><i>Jim Davies is a professor at the Department of Cognitive Science at Carleton University.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18636_54821d182370046edc3fa2d37a254cdc.png'><br><p>As I write this at the end of July, 79 wildfires are burning across 12 states in the U.S. In Oregon, a mammoth fire has engulfed some 400,000 acres—an area half the size of Rhode Island—and destroyed hundreds of buildings and vehicles, including more than 160 homes. Smoke from wildfires in the western half of the continent has darkened skies over cities in the east, including Toronto, where I am. People in Boston, New York, and Washington D.C. are struggling with hazy, smoke-filled skies.</p><p>The recent rash of news stories about wildfires has implied wildfires are getting more frequent and burning more intensely, fueled by climate change. Janice Coen is a project scientist at the<a href="https://staff.ucar.edu/users/janicec" target="_blank"> National Center for Atmospheric Research</a> in Boulder, Colorado. She has devoted her career to studying wildfires and the complex relationships among those fires, weather systems, and the atmosphere. She uses infrared imagery and computer models to try to predict where such fires will ignite and how they evolve over time, and the connections between wildfires and climate.</p><strong>FIRE FIGHTERS:</strong> Scientists who analyze fires constitute a “very strange field,” says Janice Coen. “In atmospheric science, a lot of us have similar backgrounds. But a lot of people are foresters, and that’s not physics, it’s ecology. They see the world and try to look for cause and effect, and it kind of confuses them when you talk about computational fluid dynamics models. I get a call every week from somebody modeling fires with machine learning. There’s so many things coming together.”Courtesy of Janice Coen<p>In an interview over Zoom, Coen tells me climate change plays a significant role in wildfires. However, she says, “It’s not as obvious as ‘the world’s getting hotter’ or ‘the world’s getting drier.’” The geophysics of wildfires is complex, but Coen relishes the challenge of explaining them. She says her research center is “trying to teach me to give the media soundbites of 30 seconds.” But, she adds with a laugh, her answers “are more like Thanksgiving dinners!”</p><p>And nourishing ones at that. As we discuss “fire whirls,” how fires create their own weather system, prescribed burns, and our warming world, Coen brings the science alive with authority and clarity.</p><p></p><p><b>Are wildfires becoming more extreme or frequent? Or both?</b></p><p>There’s a lot of year-to-year variability. Some years have been above average in terms of area burned, while others have been lower. We generally don’t report on that, right? It’s not a headline story. But trends can last for several decades at a time. It’s important to remember that even if you were to look at average global temperature, it could go up for 50 years, and that doesn’t mean humans are influencing the climate. Or could stay the same for 50 years, and that doesn’t mean we’re not. There’s a lot of natural variability, and humans are adding to that.</p><p><b>At the very least, it often seems like the world is burning.</b></p><p>Pretty much all of us who haven’t yet retired have only lived in this period where temperatures overall are warming. That does have an overall effect on wildfires, though the effect on individual fires can be different. For example, we’ve seen the jet stream shifting north, so there’s a dynamic effect. California has been seeing more Diablo winds, Santa Ana winds. That’s when you have a high pressure in the Great Basin over Nevada, pushing air down offshore, creating these strong winds over the Sierras and the coastal ranges. But as the jet stream shifts north, the predictions are we won’t see as many of them in the future. Also, when we talk about wildfires, it’s very much a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law" target="_blank"> power law distribution</a>. Only a few percent of ignitions ever get above 100 hectares, and those few fires account for more than 85 percent of the area burned. So we’re really talking about a few extreme events.</p><p>Winds spreading a fire are entirely generated by the fire. We’ve measured them at 100 mph.</p> <p><b>Do we know what’s triggering these extreme events?</b></p><p>They tend to fall on one end of that spectrum, either from wind-driven events where there are strong winds pushing the fire downslope, or the other end of the spectrum, where it’s hot and dry, but the winds are weak and perhaps blowing onshore. If you get an ignition at a fortuitous place, like at the base of a canyon, it can start to burn and release energy, creating a plume of rising, buoyant air above it, that draws air into its space, fanning the flames and pushing the fire forward, creating a stronger plume. This internal dynamic feedback loop can make the fire run very quickly uphill. So those tend to be the two extremes.</p><p>When we look at these extreme events, they’re often—I hate the term—“a perfect storm” of underlying susceptibility to fire. That could be a persistent dry period, with a locally appropriate weather pattern that could spread fires. Last year, the entire Southwest had a high vapor pressure deficit, and then a fortuitous ignition. In the northeast corner of California, fires are often driven by the outflow from thunderstorms.</p><p>But when we look in the weather history, we can identify what these patterns are. They have similar features in Colorado, where I live. Our big events historically have been when we have an unseasonal downslope wind event, so we have winds coming from the northwest across the Rockies, and you get some interesting gravity wave dynamics that drive winds down the east slope at 90 to 100 miles per hour. We usually get them in November and December because of the weather patterns, but when we get them in July, that overlaps with fire season, when the fields are susceptible. And with an ignition, either from lightning or humans, we’ve got these catastrophic fires.</p><p><b>I recently read about the phenomenon “<a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/videos/gallery/watch-pyrocumulonimbus-clouds-forming-in-these-incredible-timelapses-from-bc/sharevideo/6261715574001/forecasts" target="_blank">pyrocumulonimbus</a>,” or “pyroCb.” What is that?</b></p><p>When a fire is burning through vegetation, it releases heat and water vapor—water in the form of a gas—into the air above it, and that makes it more buoyant than the air outside, so it rises and creates this “fire flow.” If that’s sufficiently moist and the fire is strong enough, it will lift it to the point where it expands and cools, causing the water vapor in the air to condense into a cloud over the fire. That’s a pyrocumulus.</p><p>If it’s a sufficiently strong fire, it can drive it deeper [upward] into the atmosphere, forming ice particles. It can even rise into the stratosphere, like some of the British Columbia fires in recent years, producing deep cumulus, way up past where jet airplanes fly, creating these smoke plumes that go up to where the air is moving very quickly toward the east. It has the potential to create plumes that produce smoke that descends somewhere on the East Coast.</p><p>Those are problematic in the long term because when you create this cloud and you produce particles, it can turn into precipitation, which fall and evaporate, creating a gust front, which can change the wind direction; the fire can suddenly turn toward the firefighters. Those have been associated with a number of fatalities, including the<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-wildfires/2019/06/30/yarnell-hill-fire-arizona-will-remember-19-firefighters-who-died/1563796001/" target="_blank"> Yarnell Hill Fire</a> in Arizona in 2013.</p><p><b>What does it mean for a fire to create its own weather system?</b></p><p>Although this comes up when we’re discussing extreme weather, fire affects the atmosphere even with a simple, small grass fire. For example, if you start a fire from uniform fuels, in a straight line, with a uniform wind pushing it forward, it won’t go forward in a straight line, but instead it’ll bow into an elliptical shape. And that’s because of the nature of convection; it’s more comfortable if it collapses to a column than if it rises in a line. So it’s a really basic aspect of fire behavior.</p><p>But that term also comes up when we’re talking about more extreme events, where the wind is pushing the plume faster than the fire can keep up. In these big plume-driven events, we’ve measured winds at over 100 miles per hour, within the fire. The winds spreading the fire are entirely generated by the fire. We call them “fire-induced winds.” And those can be ten times stronger, or more, than the winds in the fire’s environment. They can rip trees out of the ground; they can snap large trees.</p><p><b>Tell us about “fire tornadoes” or firenados.”</b></p><p>They’re also called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4S-C4HMHCs" target="_blank">fire whirls</a>.” I’ve been able to model some of them, like one in the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/04/us/carr-fire-week-wrap/index.html" target="_blank"> Carr Fire</a> outside Redding, California, a few years ago. It was a giant fire whirl with winds over 100 miles per hour. It formed when winds that were coming from the west over the coastal range came down into Redding, which is at the top of the Sacramento Valley, and intersected with winds coming north up the valley, creating a shear zone where winds were coming from different directions. As the fire ran across it, the shear zone tilted that vorticity up into the vertical to create a long-lasting, very strong fire whirl, which spread for several minutes through town, causing immense destruction. So that would be another phenomenon that is created entirely by the winds generated by the fire.</p><p>There was such a persistent smoke plume that crops suffered because of the decrease in solar radiation.</p> <p><b>Can you predict where or when some of those exotic phenomena, like the fire-whirls, are likely to happen?</b></p><p>We’re able to predict many of these fire phenomena, like the fire whirls. Sometimes you get a pair of these rotating columns that tilt forward at the leading edge of the fire, and where those come together, they can accelerate the fire between them, or slow it down. When helicopters go over a ridge, sometimes they experience a sudden downdraft, where they drop 100 feet or so, which is very dangerous because they’re not very high to begin with. Those sudden descents are produced by the fire winds, and those we can capture in our models. It’s complicated, and it requires special expertise, but it is possible to do all these amazing things—predict changes in wind direction and how events will unfold. I think within the next 10 years, we ought to be able to predict where fire whirls are likely to form.</p><p><b>Let’s get back to the connection between these extreme wildfire events and global climate change. What else can you say about that?</b></p><p>Whenever there’s a giant fire, people either say, “Oh, it was fuel accumulation,” or, “Oh, it was climate change.” But it’s this alignment of factors, some of which change over much slower periods than others. When we take it apart and look at those slower-changing factors, we see certain aspects are affected by climate, like canopy moisture: Tree canopies are affected by slow-changing things like drought and insects; seasonal changes. There are certain fires which they can affect, and others where they would have a minimal impact. Attributing fire behavior to climate varies a lot from fire to fire.</p><p>We have to look at how weather patterns are changing over time. When my colleague [Andreas Prein] looked at the historical record of downslope wind events, he found an increase over the past 50 years. That means if you’re in Vancouver or Washington or Oregon, you might see more of those downslope wind events. And if that overlaps with a dry period—we also have to think about weather, particularly the dryness— if those summers extend longer into the fall and overlap these wind events, then we might see more extreme fires, like we saw last year in Oregon and Washington. It’s really complicated how these different scales come together and produce extreme fires in different areas. It’s not as obvious as “the world’s getting hotter” or “the world’s getting drier.”</p><p>Near a fire whirl, helicopters experience a sudden downdraft, where they drop 100 feet or so.</p> <p><b>I’ve also read there can be cooling that occurs when smoke from the fire starts to block out sunlight. Is that significant?</b></p><p>Yes. The smoke from the fires can trail out for very long distances. I remember during the<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr114.pdf" target="_blank"> Hayman Fire</a> [in Colorado] in 2002, we had a very deep smoke plume that went up into the atmosphere, one of those generated by a wind event, so there were strong winds drawing the smoke plume across eastern Colorado. And under the smoke plume, the temperature had gone down 10 degrees Fahrenheit, so it was much cooler under it; and that, no doubt, affected the weather. So it can become a dominant regional weather factor.</p><p>During the<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/state-emergency-bc-wildfires-1.4803546" target="_blank"> 2018 wildfires in British Columbia</a>, there was such a persistent smoke plume that people claimed to have detected a reduction in crop generation under it, because of the decrease in solar radiation. So persistent deep fires have the potential to create regional climate disturbances that affect not only your weather, but also the food you eat.</p><p><b>How important are prescribed fires—fires set intentionally, in a controlled manner—as a strategy for mitigating the potential damage from wildfires?</b></p><p>Prescribed fires are used to reduce fuel in ecosystems where fire is a natural disturbance, and it’s a good thing. We need to learn to look out the window and see a smoke plume and say, “That’s a good fire; it’s doing good things for the landscape.” Certain fires we don’t like because they impact our cities, and our communities, and the wildlands. But many of these fires serve a good purpose. But there are risks associated with them. Here in Colorado, we had a prescribed fire that escaped control. That’s not unusual, but it killed people, and that sets back the use of that tool, making land managers resort to other tools that are perhaps more clumsy and less effective, like mechanical thinning.</p><p>People want to use it more, but I think it’s overstated as a solution. The 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California, was the most destructive fire in having killed at least 85 people. In that case, the fire was re-running through previous fire scars because local weather patterns had made it a really windy spot. The Camp Fire, in its early period, ran through mostly grass. That was a previous fire scar. So we can’t attribute every catastrophic fire to not having done a lot of thinning.</p><p><b>As a scientist, you want to learn as much as you can about these complex systems; but obviously there’s also work for the policymakers and politicians. What sort of interplay between scientists and policymakers should be happening to mitigate the harm caused by these fires?</b></p><p>In our federal government, there are a variety of agencies that have a stake in it, but no one really controls fire. There’s been a lot of activity in the private sector in terms of bringing new tools and trying new things. But now we’re drowning in new tools, each of which has promised to be innovative and solve the fire problem. There’s a lot of money flying around, and it’s a very interesting, chaotic time. It seems to me it’s obviously a weather problem and a physics problem—but a lot of the policies are made using antiquated models. With the tools we have, we should be able to make better predictions about, for example, prescribed fires. Many people will say the problem isn’t a lack of technology, but that it comes down to other factors, like policy and regulation. And the culture of politics is much more challenging than the technology.</p><p></p><p><i>Dan Falk (@danfalk) is a science journalist based in Toronto.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18639_d58046673cab7fe068e4a84318bca447.png'><br><p>Researching my upcoming book on film, <i>Suddenly Something Clicked</i>, I was struck by something that had not occurred to me in 50 years of film editing. In closeups and medium closeups, cinematographers tended to place the eyes of actors along a line corresponding to the golden ratio division of the vertical dimension of the frame. In correspondence with cinematographers Vittorio Storaro (<i>Apocalypse Now</i>), John Seale (<i>The English Patient</i>), Caleb Deschanel (<i>The Lion King</i>), and directors Francis Coppola and Carroll Ballard, it became clear that this was not a conscious decision on their part. Seale put it succinctly when he wrote “I just try to make the face feel comfortable within the frame.”</p><p>The golden ratio is represented by the Greek letter phi (φ) and has held a strong grip on human imagination since it was discovered by the geometers of the ancient world. It’s represented by a bisected line whose shorter section is in the same relationship to the longer section, as the longer section is to the whole line. This ratio works out to be an irrational number, 1.618034…, and was especially valued by the astronomer Johannes Kepler, who named it as one of the two great treasures of geometry, the other one being the Pythagorean theorem. The golden ratio is the limit of the Fibonacci series, and it can be found in many unexpected places in the natural world—in the structure of DNA, the spirals of galaxies and hurricanes, the growth patterns of leaves and seeds, and many other places, including, I would suggest, in cinematography and the architecture of the human face.</p><p>I’ve learned that in the great proportion of human faces among all races, and across history, judging by painting and sculpture, our eyes fall at the golden ratio line between the hairline and chin. Furthermore, there are golden ratio proportions between other significant zones of the face: the distance of eyes to lips compared to the distance of lips to chin; eyes to nostrils :: nostrils to lips; eyes to nostrils :: nostrils to chin. There are variations, of course. Jay Leno has a disproportionately large chin, and Helen Hunt has a very tall forehead. But the overwhelming tendency is for the human face to show these proportions. This is particularly true in art, painting or sculpting an idealized face.</p><p>My tentative conclusion about cinematography was that when the face is the subject of the composition, the face feels “most comfortable within the frame” when the eyes fall along the same golden ratio line of the frame as the eyes fall within the face. A kind of compositional harmonic. Cinematographers can vary this, depending on the aesthetic of the film. Placing the eyes above the line tends to make the character more dominant, and below the line tends to emphasize the character’s relative weakness. Extreme diversions from this can be seen in films by Pawel Pawlikowski; for example, in his Academy Award winning <i>Ida</i>.</p><p>The short film below is an exploration of those zones of the face and their mathematical relationships. Why these relationships exist, and are so consistent, is a deeper mystery.</p>  <p></p><p><i>Walter Murch has been working in film for more than 50 years, as an editor, sound designer, writer, and director. He edited and sound-designed many films for Francis Coppola (</i>The Godfather Trilogy, The Conversation, Apocalypse Now<i>) and Anthony Minghella (</i>The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Cold Mountain<i>). His interest in science can be seen in his editing of Mark Levinson’s film</i> Particle Fever <i>(2013), about the search for the Higgs Boson.</i></p><br><a href='http://nautil.us/issue/104/harmony/the-natural-harmony-of-faces?utm_source=RSS_Feed&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication'>Read More…</a>]]></description>

To put it plainly, in the raw form it takes as it first rises from our hearts: <i>Why?</i> Why on Earth does it have to be this way?</p><p>In <i>The Plague</i>, <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/49/the-absurd/ingenious-albert-camus" target="_blank">Albert Camus</a>’ novel of harrowing disease in an Algerian city, Father Paneloux, a faithful Jesuit, steps to the pulpit and offers his explanation. “This same pestilence which is slaying you,” Paneloux says, “works for your good and points your path.” In another sermon, Paneloux goes further: “The suffering of children was our bitter bread, but without this bread our soul would perish from its spiritual hunger.”</p><p>A young Charles Darwin, too, wondered about this problem, and for a while, he thought perhaps he had found an answer. Indeed his argument had something in common with Paneloux’s sermon: Death and suffering were linked inescapably to a higher good, though Darwin’s good was different from Paneloux’s. Where the Jesuit placed spiritual direction and nourishment, Darwin inserted the evolution of wondrous living things. The final paragraph of <i>On the Origin of Species</i> includes this remarkable sentence: “Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows.”</p><strong>Numbering Our Lineage:</strong> Genomic analysis can, rather amazingly, give us an estimate of the population size along the lineage from the chimp-human ancestor to humans.Great Pics - Ben Heine / Shutterstock<p>Setting vast spiritual questions aside, there is a narrow sense in which Darwin was perfectly right: Embedded in the theory of evolution by natural selection is the idea that life is paid for with death. I mean this not in the poetic or sentimental sense that the price we pay for our time here on Earth is the sadness of our final departure. I mean it, rather, in the more prosaic and definite sense that the attributes we observe and admire in living creatures—precise adaptive fit to an environment, intricacy of construction, astonishing and diverse capabilities—are all built by a process that requires a certain quantity of death.</p><p>One can even calculate, under reasonable assumptions, just how much death. What Darwin did not realize, as he formulated his theodicy, is that sex tips the calculations strongly in our favor.</p><p></p><p>In matters of life and death, we ought to be precise, so consider a simple example, the sort of scenario theoreticians would call a toy model. Imagine a species that consists of 100,000 individuals, living in Edenic and equitable balance with their resources. Every individual gets to produce exactly one offspring, replacing him or herself in the population. Lovely. But what must become of this Eden if the species is to evolve?</p><p>Say one individual is born with a beneficial genetic mutation—a change in her material of inheritance, her DNA, that makes her better adapted than all her peers. She can hide better or forage faster; hunt more effectively or battle more powerfully—whatever the mutation is, it gives her a leg up.</p><p>How many useful deaths did it take to transform the chimp-human ancestor into Homo sapiens?</p> <p>For this new mutation to climb in frequency from 1 in 100,000 to 2 in 100,000, the individual who carries it must produce not one but two offspring. But the population, we’ve said, is held steady, by some limited resource, at 100,000 individuals. So for one extra individual bearing the new mutation to enter the population, one extra individual who does not bear the new mutation must die, making room for improvement, so to speak. More generally, one extra death is required for each incremental increase in the beneficial mutation’s prevalence. For the new mutation to increase by 1 percent in our population of 100,000, 1,000 extra deaths must occur. For the new mutation to be shared by the whole population—for it to <i>go to fixation</i>, as evolutionary biologists would put it—100,000 extra deaths must occur. Thus, the dues of evolution are paid in the currency of death.</p><p>We ought to add some nuance. For each incremental increase in the frequency of the beneficial mutation, it’s not technically a death that’s called for, but only the failure of one individual to survive and reproduce. Maybe someone just doesn’t get to have her allotted offspring. The point is only that the parent’s genetic lineage must come to an end. But in nature, that usually means mortality for either the prospective parent or the offspring. A reasonable shorthand is, well, just death.</p><p>When we add just a bit more biological realism to our toy model, the situation looks grimmer still. As you may recall, nearly all animals are diploid, meaning they carry two copies of their genome. Many new mutations are only semi-dominant—that is, they compromise with the other copy in their host’s genome in determining the way the host looks or acts. The great population geneticist J.B.S. Haldane wrote down a simple mathematical model to estimate how many extra deaths would be required for a new advantageous mutation to spread through the whole population of a diploid organism. Using our toy model just a moment ago, we reasoned that the number of extra deaths, spread over the entire history of the evolutionary change, would be about equal to the population size in any single generation (our 100,000). In his model of diploids with semi-dominant mutations, Haldane found that the number was more like 30 times the population size in any single generation.</p><p></p><p>What I’ve been referring to as “extra” deaths could also be called “useful” deaths, for they are the deaths that cause an uptick in the prevalence of a beneficial mutation; the deaths that, from an evolutionary point of view, aren’t for nothing.</p><p>Instead of our imaginary and idealized species of 100,000 individuals, let’s consider a real example. The most recent common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans was an ape that moved on all fours, had a skeleton a lot like a modern chimp’s, and, perhaps most important of all, had a chimp-sized brain, not our inflated <i>sapiens</i> brain. To a very close approximation, all the evolutionary changes that transformed our chimp-human ancestor into modern humans involved genetic mutations increasing in frequency in the population of proto-humans. So how many useful deaths did it take to transform the chimp-human ancestor into <i>Homo sapiens</i>?</p><p>We don’t know exactly how many mutations were favored by natural selection as the chimp-human ancestor evolved into modern <i>Homo sapiens</i>. But for purposes of this argument, we don’t really need an exact number, just a reasonable, order-of-magnitude estimate, and that’s perhaps within reach. Based on recent published analyses of human and chimp genomes, I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate the number of positively selected mutations in the lineage that leads from the chimp-human ancestor to humans. I came up with 100,000. (Said envelope, in case you’re interested, can be read below.)</p> <p>We want to do our best to estimate (very roughly) how many positively selected mutations there have been in the lineage leading from the chimp-human ancestor to humans.</p><p>There are about 30,000 non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes between chimps and humans.4 For protein-coding regions, a widely circulated estimate is that 10 to 20 percent of amino acid differences between humans and chimps have been fixed by positive selection.1 This estimate itself rests on a lot of big assumptions, but it is consistent with some other studies of samples of proteins, and probably reasonable.</p><p>So that’s (30,000 non-synonymous substitutions) * (0.15 positively selected) * (0.5 along the lineage leading to humans rather than chimps) = 2,250 positively selected mutations driven to fixation.</p><p>Functional regulatory regions appear to compose at least 7 percent of the genome.11 They evolve faster than protein-coding genes, and the fraction of changes that are positively selected is likely higher. The evidence for this is that the rate of sequence turnover events (defined as loss or gain of purifying selection) in regulatory regions is 2.5 turnover events per neutral substitution, whereas it is 0.23 turnovers events per neutral substitution in coding regions.11 This would seem to suggest that regulatory regions are extremely active in evolution, and therefore we could expect a significantly higher fraction of positively selected mutations than we see in coding regions. This is also consistent with studies of specific regulatory regions in model organisms as well as humans.4, 5, 7, 9-11 This is clearly the roughest guess of our calculation, but in conversations with population geneticists, I heard estimates of the rate of selectively driven divergence within functional regulatory regions that ranged from one-tenth of the neutral rate up to the neutral rate. (The idea is not that functional regulatory regions are neutral, but that they are subject to purifying selection on certain sites and positive selection on other sites, which together balance out to something approaching the neutral rate.) If we assume the rate is one tenth the neutral rate of divergence, we have:</p><p>(3.2 billion base pairs) * (0.07 functional regulatory fraction of genome) * (0.001 positively selected mutations, which is one tenth the neutral rate) * (0.5 on the human lineage) = 112,000.</p><p>An interesting implication here is that substitutions within protein-coding sequences are a very small part of evolutionary change compared with evolution outside of protein-coding sequences, in functional regulatory sequences.</p><p>Multiplying 100,000 positively selected mutations by Haldane’s 306 by the population size of 50,0003, 12 for each substitution gives you 150 billion useful deaths. If most evolution is due to selection on standing variation instead of new mutations, you can cut this number in half (very roughly, of course).</p><p>The number of generations is 7 million years8 divided by 20 years per generation,8 equals 350,000. The total number of deaths in the lineage leading from the chimp-human ancestor is the number of generations times the population size of 50,000, equals 17.5 billion.</p><p>All of these numbers are <i>preposterously</i> rough, but you see the general point. Unless we think about the effect of sex, there hasn’t been enough death in the history of our lineage to achieve the evolutionary change that we observe. Add sex, and this difficulty is resolved.</p><p></p><p><b>References</b></p><p>1.

Obviously, this number changed a lot over the course of the millions of years it took for the chimp-human ancestor to give rise to <i>Homo sapiens</i>. There were periods of expansive population as well as severe bottlenecks. A reasonable middle-ground is on the order of 50,000.</p><p>Recall that, in Haldane’s improvement to our toy model, pushing a new mutation from a single copy to predominance and finally to fixation required 30 times as many “extra” or “useful” deaths as there were individuals in the population during a single generation. So that means the minimal number of useful deaths required to transform the chimp-human ancestor into a bona fide <i>Homo sapiens</i> would be 100,000 (that’s the number of selected mutations) times 50,000 (that’s the population size) times 30 (Haldane’s factor). That gives us an answer of 150 billion useful deaths.</p><p>What Darwin did not realize is that sex tips the calculations strongly in our favor.</p> <p>Hmmm. That’s a really big number. How many deaths altogether, useful or not, were there along the lineage from the chimp-human ancestor to modern humans? Based on our estimate of the population size (which we just used), the average generation time (which we can make a pretty good guess at), and the total time since chimps and humans split (a number that comes from both archaeology and genetics), we can do another simple calculation to estimate the total number of deaths. I just worked it out, and it comes to ... 17.5 billion.</p><p>Oops. How can the number of useful or extra deaths that natural selection needs to evolve a human from its ancestor be larger than the total number of deaths that have taken place? Well, it can’t. So what’s the explanation?</p><p>In large part, it’s sex. Say a certain man has a beneficial mutation. And say a certain woman has one of her own, only it’s different: It confers a different advantage, and it’s located somewhere else in the genome. And say, finally, this man and this woman get together and have kids. One of those kids might get both beneficial mutations, while another kid might get neither. When the doubly lucky kid survives and reproduces, while the doubly unlucky kid doesn’t, a single death becomes doubly useful: It pays for the simultaneous rise in frequency of two beneficial mutations.</p><p>You can repeat the argument for parents who have two mutations, three, and so on. Thanks to sex, a single death can push many beneficial mutations toward their ultimate fixation. We can conclude, therefore, that although the price of life is death, sex improves the exchange rate.</p><p></p><p>Later in life Darwin seems to have relinquished any notion that the theory of natural selection might redeem death and suffering, and thus vindicate a benevolent God. In fact, an epidemic appears to have played a pivotal role in shifting his views. What shattered his faith once and for all was watching his beloved little girl Annie suffer and die from scarlet fever and perhaps tuberculosis. After that, Darwin’s views seem to have had less in common with Father Paneloux’s than they did with those of Dr. Rieux, Camus’ heroic narrator, who works tirelessly to stop the plague. Rieux vehemently rejects Paneloux’s sermon. The scourge is a scourge, he argues, and there’s no vindicating it.</p><p>And yet, though Darwin may have found no ultimate vindication for death in the creation of beautiful living things, he would continue to find profound joy in such beauty. In sexual selection, he discovered the origin of life’s most extravagant displays. He attributed a great deal of importance to that process in the descent of <i>Homo sapiens</i> from hominid ancestors. To my knowledge, though, he never realized what Haldane and genomics have helped us to see here, that sex can greatly reduce the toll required for a certain measure of evolution.</p><p></p><p><i>Aaron Hirsh is a writer and biologist with strong interests in education, evolution, and the environment.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18034_061302bf5f62eaa1ff5b3ff03c19b13b.png'><br><p><i>Panpsychists look at the many rungs on the complexity ladder of nature and see no obvious line between mind and no-mind.</i>Illustration by Yurchanka Siarhei / Shutterstock</p><p>Last year, the cover of <i>New Scientist</i> ran the headline, “Is the Universe Conscious?” Mathematician and physicist Johannes Kleiner, at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy in Germany, told author Michael Brooks that a mathematically precise definition of consciousness could mean that the cosmos is suffused with subjective experience. “This could be the beginning of a scientific revolution,” Kleiner <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24632800-900-is-the-universe-conscious-it-seems-impossible-until-you-do-the-maths/" target="_blank">said</a>, referring to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07655" target="_blank">research</a> he and others have been conducting. </p><p>Kleiner and his colleagues are focused on the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, one of the more prominent theories of consciousness today. As Kleiner notes, IIT (as the theory is known) is thoroughly panpsychist because all integrated information has at least one bit of consciousness. </p><p>You might see the rise of panpsychism as part of a Copernican trend—the idea that we’re not special. The Earth is not the center of the universe. Humans are not a treasured creation, or even the pinnacle of evolution. So why should we think that creatures with brains, like us, are the sole bearers of consciousness? In fact, panpsychism has been around for thousands of years as one of various solutions to the <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/79/catalysts/where-is-my-mind" target="_blank">mind-body problem</a>. David Skrbina’s 2007 book, <i>Panpsychism in the West</i>, provides an excellent history of this intellectual tradition.</p><p>Electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind.</p> <p>While there are many versions of panpsychism, the version I find appealing is known as <i>constitutive panpsychism</i>. It states, to put it simply, that all matter has some associated mind or consciousness, and vice versa. Where there is mind there is matter and where there is matter there is mind. They go together. As modern panpsychists like Alfred North Whitehead, David Ray Griffin, Galen Strawson, and others have argued, all matter has some capacity for feeling, albeit highly rudimentary feeling in most configurations of matter. </p><p>Panpsychists look at the many rungs on the complexity ladder of nature and see no obvious line between mind and no-mind. Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked in 1974 what is it like to be a bat, to echolocate and fly? We can’t know with any certainty, but we can reasonably infer, based on observation of their complex behaviors and the close genetic kinship between all mammals and humans—and the fact that evolution proceeds incrementally—that bats have a rich inner life. By the same logic, we can look steadily at less-complex forms of behavior that allow us to reasonably infer some kind of mind associated with all types of matter. Yes, including even the lowly electron. </p><p>While inanimate matter doesn’t evolve like animate matter, inanimate matter does behave. It does things. It responds to forces. Electrons move in certain ways that differ under different experimental conditions. These types of behaviors have prompted respected physicists to suggest that electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind. For example the late <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/43/heroes/my-life-with-the-physics-dream-team" target="_blank">Freeman Dyson</a>, the well-known American physicist, stated in his 1979 book, <i>Disturbing the Universe</i>, that “the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states which we call ‘chance’ when made by electrons.” Quantum chance is better framed as quantum choice—choice, not chance, at every level of nature. David Bohm, another well-known American physicist, argued similarly: “The ability of form to be active is the most characteristic feature of mind, and we have something that is mind-like already with the electron.”</p><p>Many biologists and philosophers have recognized that there is no hard line between animate and inanimate. J.B.S. Haldane, the eminent British biologist, supported the view that there is no clear demarcation line between what is alive and what is not: “We do not find obvious evidence of life or mind in so-called inert matter…; but if the scientific point of view is correct, we shall ultimately find them, at least in rudimentary form, all through the universe.”</p><p>Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist who was seminal in developing quantum theory, stated that the “very definitions of life and mechanics … are ultimately a matter of convenience…. [T]he question of a limitation of physics in biology would lose any meaning if, instead of distinguishing between living organisms and inanimate bodies, we extended the idea of life to all natural phenomena.”</p><p>More recently, University of Colorado astrobiologist Bruce Jakosky, who has worked with NASA in the search for extraterrestrial life, asked rhetorically: “Was there a distinct moment when Earth went from having no life to having life, as if a switch were flipped? The answer is ‘probably not.’”</p><p>Theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, author of the 2018 book <i>Lost in Math</i>, has taken a contrary position. “[I]f you want a particle to be conscious, your minimum expectation should be that the particle can change,” she argued in a post titled “<a href="http://nautil.us/blog/electrons-dont-think" target="_blank">Electrons Don’t Think</a>.” “It’s hard to have an inner life with only one thought. But if electrons could have thoughts, we’d long have seen this in particle collisions because it would change the number of particles produced in collisions.” </p><p>Yet “change” means many different things, including position in space over time. What Dyson is getting at in his remark about electrons and quantum theory is that the probabilistic distribution-outcomes of quantum experiments (like the double-slit experiment) are better explained as the product, not of pure chance (another way of saying “we don’t know”), but of numerous highly rudimentary choices by each electron in each moment about where and how to manifest. </p><p>Whitehead’s <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm" target="_blank">variety of panpsychism</a>, still the most worked-out version of panpsychism today, re-envisions the nature of matter in a fundamental way. For Whitehead, all actual entities, including electrons, atoms, and molecules, are “drops of experience” in that they enjoy at least a little bit of experience, a little bit of awareness. At first blush it’s a strange perspective but eventually makes a great deal of sense. </p><p>Rather than being unchanging things moving around in a container of space-time—the modern view in a nutshell—Whitehead conceives of particles like electrons as a chain of successive iterations of a single electron that bear a strong likeness to each other in each iteration, but are not identical to each other. Each iteration is a little different than the last. There is no static and unchanging electron. The degree to which each iteration is more or less different than the last iteration is the place for an iota of choice, and mind. This iota of choice compounds upwards and, through the course of biological evolution, results in the complex types of mind and choice that we humans and other mammals enjoy. </p><p>Whitehead, a mathematical philosopher, fleshed out in detail this process of “concrescence,” the oscillating nature of entities like electrons moment to moment, in his philosophical works <i>Science and the Modern World</i>, <i>Process and Reality</i>, and <i>Modes of Thought</i>. These are sometimes difficult works but are well worth the struggle to get through if you’re interested in basing physics on a more empirical metaphysical foundation.</p><p>Many modern thinkers have come to embrace Whitehead and panpsychism to varying degrees, including Bohm, whose <i>Wholeness and the Implicate Order</i>, his <i>magnum opus</i> on modern physics and the nature of reality, refers to Whitehead as an inspiration. </p><p>I am fleshing out in my work how we can turn these “merely” philosophical considerations about the nature of mind throughout nature into a testable set of experiments, with some early thoughts sketched <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/wheres-my-consciousness-ometer/" target="_blank">here</a>. Such experiments move debates about panpsychism out of the realm of philosophy and more firmly into the realm of science. </p><p>So, yes, there is plenty of room in modern physics for electrons to “think.” </p><p><i>Tam Hunt is a scholar and writer affiliated with the University of California, Santa Barbara.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18631_5647bc5f58e2c56b1046b5b37be3e0bd.jpg'><br><p><i>Stable cultural forms do not have to result from close replication; they can emerge continuously out of subtle changes.</i>Illustration by VectorMine / Shutterstock</p><p>Something about me must remind people of a blind 17th-century poet. My last name, Miton, is French, yet people outside of France invariably misspell it as “Milton”—as in the famed English author, John Milton, of the epic poem<i> <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/-this-man-memorized-a-60000_word-poem-using-deep-encoding" target="_blank">Paradise Lost</a></i>.</p><p>It is not uncommon for people to misspell an unfamiliar name—yet 99 times out of 100 people misspell mine as “Milton.” That is the name that shows up on everything from my university gym card to emails from colleagues.</p><p>It might seem trivial, yet this misspelling actually illustrates a key feature of how cultural practices emerge and stabilize.</p><p>When studying culture, one of the key questions scientists ask is about continuity: Why do people do the same things, in roughly similar ways, over long periods of time? Consider how traditional food recipes, say tamales, have maintained a stable core definition over generations—corn-based dough cooked in corn husks.</p><p>Most misspellings are systematic and non-random transformations.</p> <p>Cognitive anthropologists such as myself try to answer this scientific question by studying how human minds interact with culture. One approach, known as <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/30/7782" target="_blank">cultural evolution</a>, draws from <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo8787504.html" target="_blank">Darwinian theory</a> to view the evolution in longstanding cultural practices as akin to the evolution of biological species.</p><p>Most cultural evolution theorists assume that these traditions are maintained through generations by faithful transmission, or what’s known as “<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1093/bjps/axy052#:~:text=Fidelity is often used to,and that of the learner" target="_blank">cultural fidelity</a>.” Because humans are considered to be particularly adept at acquiring information through imitation, it stands to reason, they say, that we’d copy our models without mistakes. Humans, these researchers assert, <i></i><a href="https://nautil.us/issue/81/maps/the-cultural-distances-between-us" target="_blank">inherit cultural information in the same way DNA sustains genetic information</a>, with low rates of random mutations. Considering cultural change in this way has led cultural evolutionists to rely heavily on the subfield of population genetics—and to use models that assume cultural continuity works solely through inheritance.</p><p>Yet cultural information is not actually passed on through generations with the same degree of fidelity as genetic information.</p><p>The frequency of certain misspellings is one example that suggests a more complicated explanation for how humans achieve culturally stable forms. As a cognitive anthropologist working in the emergent interdisciplinary field of <a href="https://santafe.edu/what-is-complex-systems-science" target="_blank">complexity science</a>, I’m interested in how cultural forms persist not because they get reproduced with high fidelity, like genetic information—but for the opposite reason, because they’re often copied wrongly. My colleagues and I have found that people produce recurrent and similar forms over time (such as a recipe or a <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/what-drum-beat-experiment-reveals-about-cultural-evolution" target="_blank">musical sequence</a>) because of cognitive, environmental, social, and other factors related to the transmission of information that generate certain “transformations” rather than others.</p><p>In other words, I start with an assumption that cultural evolution follows different paths than biological evolution. Stable cultural forms do not have to result from close replication; they can emerge continuously out of subtle changes.</p><p>So, what does our tendency to make certain mistakes—and not others—reveal about the complexity of human cultures?</p><p>Most misspellings are systematic and non-random transformations. People transform words for any number of reasons, including whether the speaker already knows the misspelling and/or the correct spelling, or how often they have encountered similar words in the past.</p><p>In the case of my last name, “Milton” is likely a variant English-speakers have encountered far more often than “Miton.” So, if there is any doubt about the correct spelling, they default to the one they know. In my case, people may remember “Milton,” the name of a celebrated poet, from school or other settings, and thus assume that spelling to be correct. In other words, the accumulation of personal experiences, education, and other forms of cultural knowledge play a crucial role in the transmission of information.</p><p>Misspellings also emerge in relation to the linguistic environment in which they occur. If a name includes sounds not typical in a given language, speakers will usually construct a version of the name that’s closer to sound patterns that more commonly appear in that language. That helps explain why the correct <a href="https://educalingo.com/en/dic-fr/miton" target="_blank">French pronunciation</a> of Miton also sounds quite different from the <a href="https://educalingo.com/en/dic-en/milton" target="_blank">English pronunciation</a> of Milton.</p><p>Such examples of people systematically transforming different pieces of information in non-random ways abound in daily life.</p><p>One method I use to study these systematic changes in my own research takes inspiration from the children’s game “Telephone.” In this game, a child starts out with a phrase, then whispers that phrase to the next child in the row, who then repeats what they have heard to the next child, and so on. The last participant then reveals what they heard and compares that to the original phrase. Almost always, the starting and ending phrases manage to be different, which often leads to all the players bursting into laughter.</p><p>When my colleagues and I <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2020.2001" target="_blank">conduct</a> experiments to study cultural evolution, we follow a similar logic: We give the first person in a chain content to recall or a task to perform, and that person tells or demonstrates whatever they manage to recall to the next participant in the chain, and so on. This method allows us to study what kinds of transformations accumulate from person to person.</p><p>In one study, for instance, my colleagues and I asked participants to reproduce a sequence of taps on drum pads. We created different setups so the chains of participants faced different physical constraints to produce the same rhythm, using either large movements, small movements, or a mixture of both to tap on the pads. After six “generations,” or episodes of transmission, the rhythms produced by participants showed distinctive features depending on these constraints. Participants made systematic transformations according to their physical environments, which led to stable yet distinct rhythms.</p><p>As these kinds of experiments demonstrate, by observing how information changes when passed from person to person (or generation to generation), scientists can better understand the role different factors play in stabilizing traditions.</p><p>Though the majority of cultural evolutionists remain tethered to their Darwinian roots and maintain a rather strict analogy between cultural and biological evolution, increasing numbers of researchers are now investigating how the stability of particular cultural forms can be sustained through transformations rather than through faithful copying. As fallible as human transmission can be, the fact that our mistakes in transmitting cultural information occur in systematic and directed ways, rather than purely randomly, is opening a new pathway to understanding continuity and change within the field of cultural evolution.</p><p>This shift in understanding takes cultural evolution into the realm of complexity science, or the study of complex systems. This approach incorporates work from various disciplines, including anthropology, biology, physics, and computer science.</p><p>Within complexity science, large-scale social stability is understood to be caused by many different small-scale movements at the level of everyday life. From this perspective, the continuation of, say, a culinary tradition might depend on any number of cultural phenomena that continually emerge from local interactions between individuals or among small groups of people.</p><p>For instance, tamales, which I defined earlier, are not always cooked in corn husks—sometimes banana leaves are used instead. The continuation of this dish does not depend on the exact replication of a single recipe over generations but on how these recipes have been shared and modified to adjust to local products or tastes across time and space.</p><p>There are many other transformations complexity scientists like myself have yet to explore. I recently moved to New Mexico, and a new mutation of my last name—“Minton”—has shown up. I’m still trying to figure that one out.</p><p><i>Helena Miton is a cognitive anthropologist and complexity postdoctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.</i></p><p><i>This work first appeared on <a href="https://www.sapiens.org" target="_blank">SAPIENS</a> under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-ND 4.0 license</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18619_68f5f3544600e4839d80e3e5be1b9b09.png'><br><p>Japanese cuisine is so varied and refined that it’s hard to happen upon something unpleasant to the palate. My personal procedure in Japan is to take a seat at the counter and start pointing, completely at random, to a series of dishes chosen on the basis of how much I like the characters with which they are represented. Normally, they turn out to be small dishes, with small servings, that in no time start crowding the counter space allotted to me, turning it into a little work of art. That’s the moment I like best: You feel the rush that comes with gambling, but without the risk, except the negligible one of a truly unsavory dish. Then comes the pleasure of discovery: What am I eating? What are the ingredients? How was it prepared?</p><p>During one of these blind dinners in Kitakyushu, I happened onto a mysterious dish that defied all my efforts to figure it out. It was a sort of whitish little pouch about the size of a ravioli, lightly fried and filled with a creamy substance tasting of fish. The flavor was delicious and so, having finished the first serving, I promptly ordered a second, so as to study it in depth. It reminded me of something from Italian cooking but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I puzzled over it for a while but nothing came of it. I even tried to talk to the waiter about it, but in Japan hardly anyone speaks anything but Japanese. Disconsolate, I was ready to ingest the second serving, leaving my queries unanswered, when something totally unexpected happened—one of those things that make me love going out to eat by myself in Japan.</p><p>The consul was struck by my knowledge gap. “But you are concerned with plants! You simply must meet them.”</p> <p>An elderly man, sitting next to me at the counter, addressed me. That in itself is crazy. Never in all my years of visiting the Land of the Rising Sun had anyone spoken to me without being spoken to first. I had always been the one to start a dialogue. But that’s not all: He spoke to me in perfect, elegant Italian that hit a bump just for a second, right at the start of our conversation, when, embarrassed, he couldn’t find the right words to tell me, without scaring me, what I was eating.</p><p>“You see, dear sir, we give great importance to the reproduction of life,” he began, leaving me a bit disoriented. “Even though our culture is often noted in the West for its aggressive connotations, in reality there is a strong component of panpsychism [that’s the word he used] in our civilization.”</p><p>I reassured him, for reasons of courtesy, that this aggressive connotation of Japan belonged more to the past than to the present. The look on my face, however, must have remained puzzled. What did panpsychism have to do with what I was eating? He tried again.</p><p>“As a consequence of the presence of the divinity in everything, we tend by tradition to consume every single part of animals.”</p><p>Now we seemed to be getting closer. And so?</p><p>“So, that dish that you are consuming, which by the way is called shirako and is without a doubt among my favorites, too, is produced from the male germinal line of various marine species.”</p><p>“The male germinal line? You mean ...”</p><p>“Yes, what do you call it in Italian?”</p><p>“Sperm.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>So that’s what it reminded me of: milt, an exquisite Sicilian specialty with the sperm sacs of tuna or ricciola (greater amberjack), the male equivalent of bottarga or roe. The fact that in Italy people eat the same not-so-noble parts of fish (I believe for reasons much more material than those associated with panpsychism) reassured my new dinner companion.</p><p>We introduced ourselves; he was a retired diplomat. During his career, he had served his country as consul in Italy for many years, and he had learned the language. We went on to talk for a long time and with great pleasure until, just before saying goodbye, he asked me, “I imagine, Professor, that you have already had occasion to visit our Hibakujumoku,” and left the question floating in the air between us for a few seconds. I answered that I had never heard of them and that I was sorry about that. Whatever the Hibakujumoku might have been, it is not polite in Japan to say you don’t know about something without excusing yourself. The consul was very struck by this knowledge gap of mine.</p><p>“But you are concerned with plants! You simply must meet them.”</p><p>He said exactly that, “meet them,” so I thought he was referring to a group of people who in some way were concerned with plants. But his next words shattered my supposition.</p><p>“The Hibakujumoku are our escapees from the atomic bomb. A living hymn to the force of life.”</p><p>I knew that in Japan survivors of the bomb attacks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki held a fundamental position as witnesses to those atrocities. But I couldn’t understand the reason he was so insistent that I should meet them. The mystery did not last long.</p><p>“They are not people, but trees exposed to the atomic bomb. In Japan, everyone knows them and respects them. Personally, I love them. You should know them, too. I am going to allow myself to make a proposal. Hiroshima is not more than two hours from here by train. If you like, I can accompany you there in the next few days to meet them. Please tell me if you would like to do that. Since my wife died, my days are mostly free of commitments.”</p><p>I thanked him intensely and accepted his offer with pleasure.</p><p>Two days later, each of us armed with his own bento, as befits two friends on an outing, we met early in the morning in front of the train station in Kokura, ready for our trip to Hiroshima. In a little over an hour and a half, we arrived at the station in Hiroshima, and 10 minutes later we were standing before my first Hibakujumoku.</p><p>The consul had led me through a magnificent garden—whose name I unfortunately don’t remember—to “meet” three trees that had survived the bomb. I remember them very well: a ginkgo (<i>Ginkgo biloba</i>), a Japanese black pine (<i>Pinus thunbergii</i>), and a muku (<i>Aphananthe aspera</i>), three very common trees in any classical Japanese garden. The ginkgo was conspicuously bent in the direction of the city center, the black pine had a considerable scar on its trunk, but all in all, they were in good shape. Normal trees by all appearances, if it hadn’t been for the evident feeling of respect and, I would say, affection that they inspired in the people who were there to “meet them.”</p><p>A genteel elderly couple (probably husband and wife) had taken a seat on two portable chairs in front of the ginkgo and were engaged in a long conversation with the tree. A young boy gave it a quick hug before continuing on his walk. Everyone who passed by the trees seemed to know them well, and many people, from kids to old folk, bowed deeply before them. On each Hibakujumoku hung a yellow sign, the only characteristic that distinguished them from the other trees. I asked the consul what it said.</p><p>“I’ll try to translate it for you. It says more or less that we are standing before a tree that suffered an atomic bomb attack. Then it gives the vegetable species and finally the distance from ground zero,” he explained, pointing toward the river. “The explosion happened down there, where the river forks, exactly 4,494 feet from here.”</p><p>He looked me straight in the eye and said, “Talk about the Hibakujumoku, make them known.”</p> <p>That day I visited a lot of Hibakujumoku, making my way closer and closer to the place where, for the first time, an atomic ordnance was used against a defenseless population. I remember another magnificent ginkgo inside the enclosure of the Hosenbo Temple at 3,700 feet. A camphor tree (<i>Cinnamomum camphora</i>) inside the quadrilateral of the Hiroshima Castle, at 3,674 feet. A Kurogane holly tree (<i>Ilex rotunda</i>) also inside the castle grounds at 2,985 feet. A marvelous peony (<i>Paeonia suffruticosa</i>) in the temple of Honkyoji at 2,920 feet.</p><p>As we moved in closer to the center of the disaster, the Hibakujumoku began to thin out. At 8:15 in the morning on Aug. 6, 1945, the ground temperature in the place where we now were had risen above 7,200 degrees Fahrenheit; very probably it went as high as 10,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The consul had just taken me to see the shadow (literally) impressed on the stairway of the Sumitomo Banking Corporation, left by the vaporization of Mrs. Mitsuno Ochi, age 42 at the time, caught unawares by the explosion as she was waiting for the bank to open. No hope that anything could have survived all that destruction. I voiced this thought to the consul, who responded, smiling, “Man of little faith. Life always wins! Follow me.”</p><p>We went around the corner and found ourselves once again along the Honkawa River. The “atomic bomb dome,” the only building left standing and preserved as a peace museum, which by convention marks ground zero, was there in front of me, at less than 1,300 feet from where we were, and there, too, right in front of us on the riverbank stood the champion of the Hibakujumoku, a weeping willow (<i>Salix babilonica</i>) reborn from its roots left alive underground. Its yellow sign indicated a distance of 1,214 feet from ground zero.</p><p>On the way back home to Kitakyushu that evening, the consul invited me to dinner at an inn he knew. I gladly accepted. It was a very pleasant evening and we drank a lot, as often happens among friends in Japan. As we spoke about our “encounters” in Hiroshima, something left me puzzled. Each time the consul spoke of the Hibakujumoku, he defined them as “trees that had suffered an atomic explosion,” and this long circumlocution sounded funny and strangely discordant with his otherwise perfect proficiency in Italian.</p><p>So I dared to venture, “Excuse me, consul, why do you keep saying that the Hibakujumoku are “trees that have suffered an atomic explosion”? Wouldn’t it be simpler to use a word like “survivors”?</p><p>Here is his explanation: “The question is more complicated than it seems, dear Professor. It all starts with the name given to the survivors, as you say, of the bomb. Their name in Japanese is hibakusha, literally ‘person exposed to the bomb.’ There is a reason for this choice that you can grasp. This term was chosen rather than ‘survivors’ because that word, by exalting those who had remained alive, would have inevitably offended the many who died in the tragedy. As a consequence, the Hibakujumoku are referred to in the same way. I imagine that seems strange to you, but I assure you that all hibakusha are content about this and could not have abided being called ‘survivors.’”</p><p>I suggested the Italian word <i>reduci</i>, or “veterans.” He didn’t know it and he liked it very much. “Thank you so much for teaching me that word. It sounds very good. Let’s toast to our veteran friends.”</p><p>After leaving the restaurant, I insisted on accompanying him home. No one would have guessed it from looking at him, but the consul was well over 80 years old, and he had had a lot to drink. In any event, he agreed, and I accompanied him on the short walk to his home. We said goodbye. Breaking every Japanese rule, by virtue of his many years spent in Italy, the consul hugged me. He looked me straight in the eye and said, “Talk about the Hibakujumoku, make them known. And come back to visit them again.”</p><p>He paused, trying to decide. “I have to tell you. I, too, am a hibakusha. I was seven years old when the bomb did away with my whole family and everyone else in the world I knew. I was saved because the classroom in the elementary school where I was studying was protected by a curtain of trees. I and four of my classmates are the only veterans from that school. We were 120 children.”</p><p>He thought about that for a second, smiled at me one last time, and, turning to pass through the door to his home, thanked me again for my company.</p><p></p><p><i>Stefano Mancuso is one of the world’s leading authorities in the field of plant neurobiology, which explores signaling and communication at all levels of biological organization.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18622_8a16ccb268bbbe680385ddccfbe61737.png'><br><p>One of my favorite walkways in the world spans a beautiful fig in the village of Falealupo on the island of Savai’i, Samoa, formerly Western Samoa. My colleague the ethnobotanist Paul Cox invited me to visit this island in 1994 at a critical juncture in its history. The 16 tribal chiefs were at a crossroads. The Western Samoan government required villages to build cement schools because their former palm-thatch construction could not withstand the frequent monsoons. But the cost of a school was over $50,000, and Savai’i did not have a cash economy. Samoans are incredibly supportive of their children and wanted the best possible education for them, but their livelihood was based on harvesting fish from the sea and fruits from the jungle. An Asian logging company offered to harvest the island’s timber in exchange for enough funds to build a new school. The chiefs were uneasy because their entire existence over many generations relied on the forest, and even their ancestors were part of this ecosystem, returning to earth as flying foxes in the canopy.</p><p>I flew to Samoa with two construction engineers to discuss the notion of a walkway. I was honored to be included in a ceremony with all 16 tribal chiefs, where they sang, drank their sacred kava, and discussed the options of logging versus ecotourism with regard to the fate of their island trees. After more than five hours, they unanimously agreed to take out a loan and build this newfangled idea called a treetop walk. They had never heard of ecotourism before but decided to trust the concept our team had proposed: that visitors would pay to explore the island’s eighth continent. Today, a platform circles the island’s largest fig, connecting to a bridge that spans to the local school. Within two years, the debt for the new school was repaid by ecotourism, not logging. As a thank-you, the senior chief anointed me “Mati,” which means “fig,” and presented me with a sacred kava stick, now a favorite treasure. I have always admired and loved figs, but in this case, one emergent Samoan fig literally saved the trees of an entire island.</p><p>If figs disappeared in the Amazon, the entire ecosystem could collapse.</p> <p>Theophrastus, an ancient Greek philosopher who studied plants (circa 300 B.C.), is credited as the founder of botany, and the first person to describe fig species. He focused on <i>Ficus carica</i>, an important edible fig, and was unaware that hundreds of others existed, each with its own life story. He did learn about one particularly important banyan (<i>Ficus benghalensis</i>) from the stories of one of his contemporaries, the conqueror Alexander the Great, who claimed that 10,000 soldiers sheltered under one fig, with all its pillar roots forming an enormous leafy umbrella. Much later, in the early 20th century, the English botanist E.J.H. Corner specialized in <i>Ficus</i>, and described hundreds of them. One of Corner’s unique legacies was training four monkeys to fetch fig fruits in the canopy, so he could describe new species without climbing himself. He affectionately called them his “botanical monkeys.” Within six months, they collected the fruits of 350 species, far more than a human climber could.</p><p>A member of the diverse mulberry family (Moraceae), the Latin genus <i>Ficus</i> includes approximately 800 species of deciduous or evergreen trees, some of which are cauliflorous (meaning they flower and fruit along their main trunk instead of at the ends of branches), plus a few shrubs and vines. An estimated 150 figs inhabit the New World (Americas), and over 600 species in the Old World tropics (India, Asia, and Australia). Most are edible and germinate in the conventional way, starting life as a seedling and growing upward. Any fig that begins life as an epiphyte is called a banyan, technically part of the subgenus <i>Urostigma</i>, and includes the well-known strangler figs. In my global exploits as a field botanist, I found that stranglers occupy the most extraordinary lifestyle of any trees on the planet, bar none! The name itself conjures up the antics of James Bond or some Sherlock Holmes murder mystery, but the actual life history of this species engenders shock and awe. During his exploration, Alfred Russel Wallace called stranglers “the most extraordinary trees of the forest.”</p><strong>A PERFECT STRANGLER:</strong> In her global exploits as a field botanist, Meg Lowman has found that strangler fig trees “occupy the most extraordinary lifestyle of any trees on the planet, bar none!”Amit kg / Shutterstock<p>My first exposure to the incredible strangler figs came when I climbed them in Australia, most notably the iconic emergent <i>Ficus watkinsiana</i>, named for George Watkins, the former president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Queensland and plant collector. He was an Englishman who came to Queensland in the 1800s and trained as a pharmacist. He pursued natural history in his spare time and participated in numerous expeditions. In 1891, F.M. Bailey named a fig species after him. It was called Watkins’ fig, nipple fig (due to the fruit structure), or green-leaved Moreton Bay fig. Its fruits are rounded, purple-black, and have distinct “nipple” structures, although the word “fruit” is deceptive because figs are anatomically not really fruits but a cluster of hundreds of flowers enclosed in a smooth skin. Like other fig species, the trees have male and female flowers on one plant, known as monoecious, from the Greek word for “one house.” <i>F. watkinsiana</i> leaves are tough, waxy, and entire, although a few fig species have lobes. Another famous Australian banyan is the curtain fig outside Atherton, Queensland, which occupies close to an acre of ground with all its aerial roots, though it’s not nearly as vast as Alexander the Great’s historical tree.</p><p>Different from most tree seeds that germinate on the forest floor, which is relatively dark and inhospitable to a delicate seedling, stranglers start life at the top with plenty of sunlight. When a figbird ingests fig fruits, it defecates the seeds onto an upper branch. This unique beginning means stranglers literally start life as an epiphyte with adequate light, eventually sending down roots to absorb water and nutrients below. The limiting factor for a strangler seed tends to be moisture, so germination is most successful on rotting or decaying bits of branches. My fellow “arbornaut” (who explores tree canopies) Tim Laman of <i>National Geographic</i> studied the germination of one strangler fig (<i>Ficus stupenda</i>) in Asia. He placed its fruits in the canopy to determine ideal conditions for downward growth and found they grew best in moist, decaying branches or wet bark crevices. Tim also documented the many animals that disperse figs, including hornbills, gibbons, orangutans, and flying foxes.</p><p>A wasp dies inside a fig after pollination. Anyone who eats figs is consuming wasp biomass.</p> <p>Once a strangler is established in the crown, a latticework of downward-growing stems thickens with time and often surrounds the host, sometimes creating a hollow center if the host has soft wood and subsequently rots inside. In some cases, strong-wooded host species survive and live in tandem with the strangler, so both trees are intertwined as a massive duo. Although stranglers, or banyans, often constrict their host, they also sustain thousands of other creatures in the ecosystem. It seems astounding that other species have not evolved this adaptation to outcompete for light, space, and water by starting at the top. Seedlings that germinate on the forest floor must wait patiently, sometimes decades, for a treefall to create a light gap, plus have the good fortune of not being trampled, eaten, or buried during their precarious juvenile phase. Some figs eventually form buttresses, which are aboveground prop roots that stabilize their shallow-rooted shapes; they would otherwise be prone to fall during monsoons.</p><p>Mature <i>Ficus</i> (including banyans) produce thousands of fruits, an important food source in tropical food webs. Fertile figs, like the ones we eat, are distinct because of their unique fleshy, hollow receptacle with an inner surface laced with tiny flowers or fruitlets. All species have tiny male and female flowers that develop on the inside wall of a syconium, which eventually becomes a fruit. A tiny female wasp of the Agaonidae family enters a hole in the top of the syconium and passes through a tunnel lined with downward-facing scales that only allow one-way travel. The wasp finds two types of female flowers inside: stalked, short-styled flowers and long-styled flowers that are not stalked. While she pollinates the flowers, the wasp also lays her eggs and then dies. After a few weeks, her offspring hatch, and wingless males mate with winged females, then chew an exit tunnel that allows the females to fly to another fig and repeat the process. The females pick up pollen from recently matured male flowers as they exit. Some botanists originally thought all 800 species required a specific pollinator wasp, but more recent molecular analyses reveal that 119 fig species shared multiple pollinator wasp species. When a wasp dies inside the fig after pollination, enzymes (called ficain) break down the carcass; consequently, anyone who eats figs is also consuming wasp biomass. When scientists at the National University of Singapore experimentally exposed fig wasps to warmer temperatures, their lifespan significantly shortened. This suggests climate change could jeopardize <i>Ficus</i> pollination success, if wasps don’t have enough time to find their specific fruits. As always, it is difficult to extrapolate from the laboratory to the forest.</p><p>As with most complex interactions, additional players in the fig-wasp interactions are parasitic wasps, some of which also lay eggs inside figs, which prevents the beneficial pollinator wasps from entering. Even worse, some parasitic wasps inject their eggs through the fig’s surface without even boring a pathway inside, and their offspring feed on the pollinator wasp larvae. Hundreds of wasps function as pollinators, and each <i>Ficus</i> species is known to host up to 35 species of non-pollinating wasps, making their crowns a hotspot of biodiversity. In addition to wasps, over 1,200 recorded species of birds, insects, bats, and mammals, including humans, eat the fruits, making <i>Ficus</i> a true keystone species for the biodiversity of many tropical forests. In the Amazon, ornithologist John Terborgh wrote that if figs disappeared, the entire ecosystem could collapse. Biologist Dan Kissling correlated the number of fig species in sub-Saharan Africa with the abundance of fruit-eating bird species, and concluded figs were the keystone resource.</p><p>Figs have many uses for humans as well as for insects, birds, and animals. Their milky latex contains medicinal properties, and in the Amazon, villagers administer a teaspoon to cure stomach parasites in children. According to indigenous people in French Guiana, Colombia, and Brazil, the same sticky latex can cure cuts, fractures, and abscesses. In Nepal, <i>Ficus benghalensis</i> leaves, bark, and roots are used to treat more than 20 ailments; this useful banyan is also used in India to treat a wide variety of disorders ranging from tooth decay to hemorrhoids, diabetes, and constipation. At one time, figs were grown for rubber latex in India and parts of Africa. Probably the most famous fig is <i>F. religiosa</i>, or the Bo tree, native to India and Southeast Asia, thought to be the canopy under which Buddha received enlightenment. This is one of several species that in India and Asia dominates the center of many rural villages as an important spiritual gathering site.</p><p>Embarking on a new role as grandmother this decade, I have decided to use my Samoan nickname of Mati instead of Grandma; I will tell my grandchildren about all the wonderful figs I have encountered. Maybe someday I’ll whisk them off to the island of Savai’i in Samoa to see an incredibly special walkway in an emergent fig or to climb a few favorite stranglers in Australia.</p><p></p><p><i>Meg Lowman, Ph.D., aka “CanopyMeg,” is an American biologist, educator, ecologist, writer, editor, and public speaker.

            <description><![CDATA[<img src='http://static.nautil.us/18628_d878ff69f51f20f15d0b5c18e09bcf10.png'><br><p>We all live in two worlds: a world outside of ourselves containing things that others can also see and hear and touch, and a world inside consisting of our thoughts and imaginations, which only exist in our own mind. Usually, we effortlessly keep these two worlds apart. But a recent study I ran together with metacognition expert Steve Fleming at University College London’s Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, where I am a senior research fellow, affirms that the 18th-century Scottish philosopher <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/why-david-hume-is-so-hot-right-now" target="_blank">David Hume</a> was right all along—distinguishing reality and imagination is less straightforward than we might think.1</p><p>To perceive the outside world, our brain combines signals entering our brains through our eyes with what we expect the world to look like based on our past experiences.2,3 This means that our perception of the outside world is strongly influenced by what we believe. An example of this is the <a href="http://persci.mit.edu/gallery/checkershadow" target="_blank">checker shadow illusion</a> shown below in which our knowledge about how shadows influence color makes the B square look lighter than the A square, when in fact they are exactly the same shade.</p><strong>ONE SHADE OF GRAY:</strong> Our knowledge about how shadows influence color makes the B square look lighter than the A square, when in fact they are the same shade.Wikipedia<p>To imagine something that is not there, we use our knowledge to generate an image of what we think something looks like. Recent studies have shown that the neural processes supporting <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/99/universality/our-most-effective-weapon-is-imagination" target="_blank">pure imagination</a> are highly similar to those involved in perceiving the outside world: When we imagine a cat in our mind’s eye, a similar network of brain areas gets activated as when we see a real cat out in the world.4,5 These observations demonstrate that brain signals reflecting imagination and signals reflecting reality are completely intermixed in our brain, muddling the distinction between our inner world and the outside world, between reality and fantasy. Does this intermixing lead to confusion between <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/19/illusions/your-brain-cant-handle-the-moon" target="_blank">what is real and what is imagined</a>?</p><p>At the beginning of last century, the American psychologist Mary Cheves West Perky pioneered experimental testing of confusions between imagination and perception.6 Using an ingenious technical set-up, Perky aimed to “build up a perceptual consciousness under conditions which should seem to the observer to be those of the formation of an imaginative consciousness.” In other words, she tried to get people to mistake perception for imagination. Participants were asked to imagine an object, for instance a tomato, and describe their experience. At the same time, unknown to the participant, Perky projected these same objects at just-visible intensities. In all cases, participants failed to notice that real stimuli had been presented and instead insisted that everything that they saw was the result of their own imagination, saying things like “Feels as if I was making them up in my mind,” and “It is more distinct [than the images I usually have]; but I have never tried much.”</p><p>There is no real categorical difference between imagination and reality.</p> <p>Now, more than a hundred years later, this “Perky effect” has achieved a “classic, even mythic status in the literature on imagery.”7 However, replication attempts with modern set-ups have yielded mixed results.8 One reason for this discrepancy might be that contemporary research standards require that the same task is performed many different times. This is important to estimate variability in behavior and determine statistical significance. But, in the context of monitoring reality, repetition greatly influences results because it allows participants to correct previous confusions. As soon as a participant realizes that a real image is presented, they will look for a real image on all subsequent trials, biasing attributions toward reality.</p><p>To address this issue, in our experiment, each participant did only one critical trial. But we collected our data online, allowing us to test hundreds of participants.1 This way, we could combine the essence of Perky’s original experiment, in which participants did not know real images could be presented, with enough statistical power by testing hundreds of participants. We asked participants to imagine a shape and indicate how vivid their experience was. At the same time, unknown to the participant, we also presented a just-visible shape that was either the same or different to the one they were imagining. After that we asked participants whether they thought a real shape had been presented or whether anything they saw had been the result of their imagination. Did participants fail to notice the presentation of the real shape when they were also imagining it, thinking it was just their imagination?</p><p>What we found was quite astonishing. In contrast to Perky’s findings, participants were <i>more</i> likely to say they saw a real picture when imagination and reality were matched compared to when they were different. But, when they saw a real picture, they also said their <i>imagination</i> of that same picture was more vivid. Even when we did not show a real picture, participants who nonetheless reported seeing a real picture also said that they <i>imagined</i> that picture more vividly. These results suggest a modification of Perky’s ideas. In line with what she found, imagination was reported as more vivid when the same signals were also perceived, suggesting confusion between the two, but in contrast to what she found, we do not fail to notice things we simultaneously imagine, we are actually more likely to see them in the outside world.</p><p>This combination of results can be very neatly explained by the idea that internal and external signals are intermixed to create one conscious experience. When this mixed signal is strong or vivid enough to cross a reality threshold, we think it reflects reality. When the same object is perceived and imagined, the combined signal is stronger, so we are more likely to think this object is really out there. This also fits well with our daily experience. When we are waiting on the bus, we do not fail to see it because we are thinking about what it looks like—that would be very inconvenient, making you miss the bus because you are waiting for it. Instead, we are more likely to see the bus when we are thinking of it, and sometimes, this also leads to confusion; for example, when we mistake the truck coming around the corner for the bus we are waiting for.</p><p>This means that there is no real categorical difference between imagination and reality, but that they are subjectively intermixed. When this combination of internal and external signals is strong enough, we believe it reflects reality. This is in line with what Hume wrote, in 1739, in Book I of his <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i>: “The idea [imagination] of red which we form in the dark, differs only in degrees of intensity, not in nature, from the impression [perception] of red that strikes our eyes in sunshine.”9 When the things that we imagine are not really there, nor anything that looks like it, signals are unlikely to be strong enough to lead us to believe they reflect reality. However, when, for some reason, internally generated signals <i>are</i> strong enough, they will be indistinguishable from reality.</p><p>As it turns out, reality and imagination are completely intermixed in our brain which means that the separation between our inner world and the outside world is not as clear as we might like to think. If our imagination is vivid enough, we will think it is real and we use our imagination to create our perception of reality, which means, “We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.”10</p><p></p><p><i>Nadine Dijkstra is a senior research fellow at the Wellcome Centre of Human Neuroimaging at University College London.

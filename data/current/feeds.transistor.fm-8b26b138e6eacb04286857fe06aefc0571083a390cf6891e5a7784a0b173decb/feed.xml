        <![CDATA[<p>[00:00:39] Go Rails and Discord went crazy for Go Rails this morning, Collin talks about putting out the fires. This reminds Andrew of the issue he had with his dotfiles once. Admit it, we’ve all been there before! </p><p><br></p><p>[00:05:31] Collin is enjoying his minimal config setup lately. Andrew talks about how he likes using Znap! to help him with his dot files and reduce his shell’s startup time.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:06:43] Andrew talks more about minimalizing his setup by getting rid of aliases he’s not using every couple months, as well as plugins. It’s hard to stop hoarding those plugins! </p><p><br></p><p>[00:07:13] Collin really only uses Vim but has a lot of theme plugins, and the plugins he does have tend to be from Tim Pope.  </p><p><br></p><p>[00:08:26] Both Collin and Andrew dive deeper into aliases. Collin, he’s runs his pretty lean and just uses some mnemonics for Rails commands. Andrew did a lot of house cleaning and now just has a handful for very basic things for Rails and Git.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:14:06] Andrew discusses functions and thinning the herd. One that he does love is the GitHub labels he made. Andrew talks about how great the GitHub CLI is, and if you haven’t checked it out in a while, PLEASE DO.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:17:59] Andrew recently switched his terminal to Warp, a Rust based terminal. Find out why he’s almost as excited about Warp as he is when DoorDash shows up with Chick-fil-a. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:19:48] The boys talk tmux and Andrew tells us the NUMBER 1 reason why he uses it. Tell us if you’ve had this happen. Ha! And have we told you how much Andrew loves Warp? He tells us more things it can do to make your life easier.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:25:39] Collin moved to Vim about six months ago and talks about making the move over to it. Andrew tried it in the past, and he thinks it’s time to board the Vim train again. Like he says, and this applies to anything new you bring into your workflow, “You just need to dive in, take your time, and you’re gonna be moving slow at first.”</p><p><br></p><p>[00:28:11] The whole Vim talk evolves into remapping your keyboard to prevent your fingers from contorting.  </p><p><br></p><p>[00:34:49] After Andrew talks about some of his go to VSCode plugins, Collin wants to know more about his VSCode setup and layout. Andrew talks more about some of the plugins he likes, like Customize UI, and how he likes to keep his VSCode looking clean.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:36:31] Let’s talk monitor setups: Multiple, single, full screen. Find out Collin and Andrew’s setup. Collin shares a keyboard shortcut he uses to manage his windows.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:40:00] One last thing…whether you prefer Alfred or Raycast, it’s time to replace your Spotlight. Andrew talks about the benefits it has in his workflow and Collin, who doesn’t need another tool, is intrigued. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:43:23] So, let’s summarize it for you. If you’re new to coding…bookmark this spot.

      <description>While Jason and Andrew are conferencing it up at the Rails SaaS Conference, Chris thought it would be a great idea to have Collin Jilbert join him, so he didn’t have to go solo today.  Chris and Collin catch up and discuss what they’ve been working on with Pay, we hear about a new beginner series of making a Ruby Gem Collin’s been working on for Screencasts, and Chris tells us about a Screencast he did on OmniAuth coming out soon, that is worth watching.  Also, we’ll find out some good things happening with Hatchbox, some changes with Simple Calendar to make it more functional, and Chris trying figure out some caddy configuration JSON nested stuff. So go ahead and download this episode now!</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Live from Portland at rails comp 2020. We're recording a podcast panel crossover episode. I'm Gemma is off one of the co-hosts of the Ruby on rails podcast. I'll be moderating this panel. We have five podcasts represented here across eight panelists. We're going to go around to start and hear what all everyone is excited about.</p><p>For rails comp. First up, we have Brittany Martin from the Ruby on rails podcast. Brittany, what talker workshop are you most looking forward to? </p><p>[00:00:29] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> I have to admit I'm going to go with a meta answer and it's going to be this panel, but also as well to make a switch track, which I ended up curating. We already saw Joel Hawksley gave a fantastic talk as well as David Hill.</p><p>And I'm just excited for that track to continue. </p><p>[00:00:44] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Sounds great. Looking forward to hearing the rest. Next up, we have Robbie Russell of maintainable software podcast. </p><p>[00:00:51] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> Hello, I'm enjoying so far. The, uh, what does it talk to me like I'm five or I forgot the way it's titled, but yeah, the tracks there have been really great in terms of getting down to some of the basics and such.</p><p>And so. Kind of mandating most of my teams at, and those ones in particular, if they can do which ones have you been to so far? I just sat in the rails console one and I learned a few things that I didn't know about or I'd forgotten about like using jobs in rails console is pretty fun having sub-processes and there was one earlier on maintaining rails applications.</p><p>I really enjoyed that one. Next up </p><p>[00:01:26] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Andrew Culver from framework friends. </p><p>[00:01:28] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Yeah. So for me, conferences are about people. And so I'm kind of notorious for hanging out in the hallway, track, all attend a few talks, but mostly like for the limited time that I'm here, I come in late. I leave real early. Cause I got kids that I got to get back to back home.</p><p>But for the time that I'm here, I just try to have as much face time with, you know, everybody like who's in the room right now. </p><p>[00:01:50] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Nick swatter, Ruby on rails pod. </p><p>[00:01:53] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> I'll do </p><p>[00:01:53] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> two things. One, I like trails con for me, his bag. I'm just so hyped for it. I'll call out. Hi, joined the Ruby community in first week of March, 2014 and never been to rails comp.</p><p>I've like followed the content for eight. So it's such a treat to be here by will to honor your question, pick a specific thing. I'm excited to see the remote group began talking about a pocket while I won't spoil anything. I love our community, but seeing people not just carving out their niche, but like helping to grow more of things in the community to make it sustainable, to make it more welcoming and open to more people.</p><p>And so I'm absolutely, as you're saying, the UK buzzing to see, and I agree began, </p><p>[00:02:31] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> and there's a whole </p><p>[00:02:32] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> community content. Speaking of remote Ruby, Andrew Mason. </p><p>[00:02:36] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> Yeah, what's up everybody. I was excited for Joel Hawksley's talk, which is great. Joel, again, Joe's in the audience for anyone listening. I'm excited for Schwan's talk because Schwab always gives amazing talks.</p><p>I'm always excited for Brittany's talk and Britney's not giving a talk this month. So that's why I'm excited to hear her </p><p>[00:02:54] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> here. Uh, next up </p><p>[00:02:56] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Jason. Tarryn's. </p><p>[00:02:59] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> Hello? </p><p>[00:03:01] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> Well, I feel like any answer I have now would just be cheating. I too very much like the hallway track and the people, I very much enjoy Joel sock.</p><p>Dave, Copeland's giving one. I'm really looking forward to the one I'm least looking forward to is the remote Ruby </p><p>[00:03:13] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> talk. </p><p>[00:03:15] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> Oh. And </p><p>[00:03:16] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> I'm excited that Aaron Francis is here so we can talk about Laravel this whole </p><p>[00:03:18] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> time. </p><p>[00:03:21] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Also have remote with me. We have Chris Oliver next. </p><p>[00:03:24] <strong>Chris Oliver:</strong> I'm just so excited to like put faces to Twitter, avatars and discord and everything had conversations with so many people.</p><p>And then finally getting to meet them in person is the best. That's what I'm looking forward to the most. </p><p>[00:03:37] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> And we have Colleen Chandler from the software social </p><p>[00:03:40] <strong>Colleen Schnettler:</strong> podcast. I am super excited about my workshop, which is coming up in 45 minutes, filling an advanced query builder with active record. And there's actually quite a few active record talks here this week.</p><p>So I'm super pumped for those. I'm really looking forward </p><p>[00:03:56] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> to it. So next question I have is why podcast, and maybe we can get into the community content track a little, or, or what's going on. </p><p>[00:04:04] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> Yep, Brittany. So I love its ability to be a time capsule. And it's so cool to have a timeline of my own career, but it's even cooler to watch my co-hosts career.</p><p>Nick's first episode was September, 2018. He was a regular guest, and then he became official cohost in 2021. And then Gemma's first episode was in March, 2021 and then became a cohost also in 2021. And each have had like a really unique path to Shopify and establishing themselves more in the community.</p><p>And. I feel really grateful that I have an opportunity to talk </p><p>to </p><p>[00:04:36] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> them regularly about it. We feel grateful for the same remote Ruby. I know you're doing a whole talk on podcasting. Do you want to give us a little preview? </p><p>[00:04:46] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> All are they intrude? If the preview? </p><p>[00:04:48] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I think podcasting is a great way to kind of reach a very large audience without as much overhead as producing videos.</p><p>So our talk is basically on how to start a podcast and it's tailored towards Ruby, but it's going to be about kind of our journey to starting one kind of the lessons that we've learned, because I've, at this point I've been on three. Jason. And Chris started remote Ravi men. Then I joined them later. So I think we have individually a lot to share with the community to help them not fall into the same traps that we did.</p><p>So that's our goal is to like help encourage people to start their own podcast and do it in a way that they can avoid some of the huge mistakes that we've made over the years. </p><p>[00:05:29] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> What are some of the mistakes? </p><p>[00:05:31] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> It takes a team. In my opinion, to produce a great podcast from editors, from doing marketing, doing show notes, you know, there's so many aspects of it and having cohos.</p><p>And if you only have two co-hosts one person doesn't show up, what do you do then you skip a week. I think consistency is really important and it's kind of back to us about having a team. And when you don't have that team in place, it can really produce a lot of heartache and headache. And a lot of after hours work on the podcast, which is not the goal.</p><p>And it really detracts from the. Colleen, </p><p>[00:06:02] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> do you have a similar view on podcasting? So </p><p>[00:06:05] <strong>Colleen Schnettler:</strong> one of the things I love about podcasting is this concept of luck, surface area. And it's this concept that the more visible you are, the more opportunities come your way. I'm a self-taught developer. And when I got into software, everyone's like, you should blog.</p><p>You should blog. I could not get into blogging. I just could not get into a good routine. I didn't like it. And then I started podcast. Random people on the internet, listen to the podcast and then people recognize you and then they know you. And I have found for me like professionally, first of all, I love it.</p><p>Cause I do a podcast with someone who I'm already friends with, but professionally like opportunities start coming your way as you become more visible. And I think it's a very low friction way to become more visible </p><p>[00:06:53] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Andrew yet. Do you have similar thoughts? </p><p>[00:06:54] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Yeah. So for me. We were already having conversations.</p><p>So Aaron and I were already chatting. And so by just hitting record, they gave us this opportunity to kind of like share that. I kind of had a sense, like, yeah, people might find this interesting what you can't. If for anybody that's listening, there are so many podcasts. You have friends like Justin Jackson and like his whole life, his podcasts, because there's so many of them.</p><p>And so anybody that thinks that they have a unique take on something, if you're thinking about starting a podcast, start a podcast, just do it because what you can't know. Before you do it before you start publishing, before you start sharing your ideas is who's going to come out of the woodwork. And yeah, we got like feedback from people that we knew, but we also met tons of people that we've never heard of before that reach out and say like, Hey, I love that.</p><p>And people that come up to you at conferences and say, Hey, you know that conversation that you had, I really identified with that. That really captured something that I had been thinking about. And until you start publishing stuff, you can't know if that's going to happen. And it's so low friction, like unlike blogging, which it takes a ton of time.</p><p>We were already having the conversation. So you just hit record and you publish it. And then I think the other piece of it as well, which for folks who have guests on their podcast, it's amazing. To think that you can provide infrastructure for super smart people, people that are way smarter than me, you can get them on.</p><p>We had a guy say this to us recently where he didn't want to reach out to people and be like, Hey, can I come on your podcast? But he said, but reach out every six months because I might have something to say. And so the idea that you can get an audio. And then you can share with that audience, the incredible thinking of people that may only want to do a podcast a couple times a year.</p><p>That's another thing that I love about the medium. </p><p>[00:08:51] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> So the ability to enable others or to push others forward. Yeah. You mentioned feedback a few times hearing from your listeners. I know that something that it's tough to do as a podcast host, it's tough to figure out where your listeners are and how they talk to you.</p><p>Does anyone have thoughts on that? </p><p>[00:09:09] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Twitter is the best thing ever. I live on Twitter. And so when you open your DMS, make it easy for people to send you messages. Yeah. Just open that sucker right up. Robbie, have you </p><p>[00:09:20] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> had similar experiences? </p><p>[00:09:22] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> You know, Twitter is helpful. So I do encourage people to email me as well.</p><p>Mike format doing more of like interview style and fairly. Topics, but just a broad range of different people. So, but the angle that I, you know, if it's terms of communication, it's also, but it's going to be lonely as a podcast or not. You don't hear often, sometimes we'll post stuff on Twitter and hopefully the guests will reshare that and their network, or we'll help interact with that.</p><p>But there's other areas I've found like some interaction over like Reddit. Sometimes I'll post the links there as well, and try to use some controversial title for the episode, just to kind of provoke people a little. That tends to help a little bit as well. Those are some areas, but I do get a lot of emails and occasional DMS and stuff from people.</p><p>[00:10:06] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Banana thought. </p><p>[00:10:07] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> Yeah, for me, I used to have a very loyal listener who would tell me about how terrible my audio was. And I so appreciated them for it because I was learning. And then as I tweak things, I would have sessions with them. And then eventually when we hired a professional editor, he reached out to me and told me how proud he was of me.</p><p>And then he would just really believed in the podcast. He held on for all that time that I was learning, but I will say too, the greatest joy for me, I will echo Andrew is when I'm on Twitter and someone will tweet an inside joke from an episode and bring it back. Like we get jokes about goo. We get jokes about treading water.</p><p>It's really fun for me to share those jokes with those lists of. I </p><p>[00:10:47] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> think you can be the source of your own feedback as well. I say time and time again, like I'm the only one who listens every single week when our podcast listens, I listened to it and that is a way for me to find errors in the way I speak things that I do when I speak like arm, like, and, uh, and things like that also is if you solicit.</p><p>Kind of going back to what Robbie was saying, that's another great way to get it. And I've also said that when you get that feedback, it may not always be positive and it may not mean that you need to change anything. Not all negative feedback means that, oh, I should adjust this because this one person doesn't like the way we do.</p><p>[00:11:23] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> I was just going to say on the, like, asking for people to do reviews, I've found that if I kind of repeat that over and over, it's kind of becomes an echo chamber of nothing. It's hard to get reviews on apple podcasts and other places. I don't even know where else people were telling me, but go anywhere is stitch.</p><p>You're still thinking. Do you know, sometimes I'll just kind of go a little off script and then I'll be like, or write something and some chalk on the sidewalk. And then someone sent me a photo that they did that they were like, oh cool. I got a nice review on some sidewalk in someone's neighborhood. So thank you.</p><p>Whoever that was. </p><p>[00:11:54] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> And feedback is definitely a gift. It's taken me a long time for me to learn that in like most areas. Like, y'all listen to podcasts. I listen to podcasts. It's quite a big commitment to carve out a half hour, 20, 30 minutes, 60 minutes of your day, especially in a remote world where you don't commute.</p><p>So we don't have that cheat code as often anymore. And so most people, if they're unhappy, what do you do? You just switch off? So like how much does somebody care to? Actually, even if it comes off as quite terse with feedback, sometimes it can either be, well, if it's true, why are you offended? And if it's not true, then hire you.</p><p>Because not true. I'd always things for me. Any feedback on anything? This is not even just in podcast, but if you can try and wrap a Colonel out of it and make something positive, it's might be one of the nicest things you hear. </p><p>[00:12:37] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Switching gears a little bit. Chris Oliver, what do you love about the Ruby ecosystem?</p><p>[00:12:42] <strong>Chris Oliver:</strong> A lot, probably the people the most beside from that, there's something about the Ruby ecosystem that started in entrepreneurship and. The language itself has kinda like designed around humans first, which is unique and rare. So it's all kind of around people and stuff. Hey, </p><p>[00:13:02] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> what else have thoughts here?</p><p>Andrew Kovar. </p><p>[00:13:05] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> So I think the thing that attracted me to the Ruby ecosystem like 10, 12 years ago now it was tooling. And I think that comes back to what Chris is talking about. That it's a human. Maths is nice. So we are nice, like the whole Mina Swan thing. And then the way that, that bubbles up, I think into rails, since we're at rails comp, as a framework is the developer experience.</p><p>It's like a framework that was developed with empathy for the way that you would interact with it. And that was different than a lot of what existed at the time. And I think other frameworks have taken inspiration from that. And we certainly don't have a monopoly on developer experience. I think we can look to other frameworks for inspiration.</p><p>There is. But the focus on tooling, you know, it, it's interesting. There's a white quote. I'm probably going to butcher it a little bit, but I think there's actually like a lesson to be learned from it. So one of the things that Y said toward the end of his tenure was software. So unrewarding to write something and then a year later it gets replaced by something better.</p><p>And then a few more years go by and it doesn't run at all. It doesn't run at all. There's an inverse way. Of looking at that quote. And that is that our stuff's always getting better. There isn't a monopoly on anything and you can always propose a new, a better way. And we're the beneficiaries of that. And because there's that focus on developer experience that keeps driving us forward rails continues to compete.</p><p>It continues to be like, I think it is still to this day, the best way to launch SAS applications specifically. And so that's one of the things that I love about rails and love about the community. It's that focus on people </p><p>[00:14:50] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> what's missing. And we have a foremost why expert, I think probably in the world next to you, who is nodding along.</p><p>So I think we can say that quote was all good. What's missing that next year or the next year or the next year we might see in the community. Jason. </p><p>[00:15:04] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> So they talked about Ruby cough, but Andrew is talking about. But like tooling, it's kind of stagnated. It feels like. And the Ruby community, Ruby ecosystem, and like they were talking about Ruby three's focuses on developer experience.</p><p>There are times I've considered not writing Ruby. I watched these other people work in languages and they can do amazing things like amazing refactorings and then even things like suggestions. And I'm like, I'm still writing the same Ruby code I'm writing five years ago. So I think that's something we can improve on for sure.</p><p>And I think they're trying, so that's </p><p>[00:15:36] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> encouraging, I think this will lead into another white quote from it's the similar time which was, and I think that's applies for our community. If you don't create, you become defined by your tastes and your tastes can only alienate other people. So create. And I think that that's something that we can, we have a mature ecosystem.</p><p>Now we can really be lazy if we want. And I think the railway is awesome. Like the Ruby way is awesome, but I think we can now put the manta on our shoulders and create, even if it's just fantastic, interesting new jams, be the content we want to see in the world. And that goes with podcasting. It goes with open source.</p><p>I really feel Jason saying. And I think that part of that solution would be to continue to create new and innovative things. I think there's definitely a lot of room for that. We could definitely stagnate and make awesome SAS apps, crowed SAS apps all the time with rails, but I think there's a lot more innovation </p><p>[00:16:26] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> and fun to be had.</p><p>I think that's a call to action. I think that's what for anybody that's listening to that if that resonates with you, I think we're just scratching the surface. Of what we can do to make it easier for people to develop software. It's such a lucrative opportunity. I have like a physical product business as well, and the margins are terrible.</p><p>It's so awful. And like when I sold my first SAS business, the margins, when we went through due diligence for like 95%, we operated at a 95% profit margin. That is an opportunity that we should be trying to get in. And we haven't even scratched the surface of all the SAS software that can be written with rails.</p><p>You can find a mission in it in creating better tooling, higher levels of abstraction, greater developer experience and usability so that we can give these tools the best set of tools to a greater set of people so they can improve their economic situation. A single person building a SAS app can change their life.</p><p>And I think we've got the best tool to give to people for that. </p><p>[00:17:33] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Yeah. Or even I would argue, uh, enable people to build their own tools that can lift them up. Robbie, do you have thought there, </p><p>[00:17:40] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> I'm going, go ahead down a little bit of lemon here and say that I disagree with everybody. To an extent I'm actually more interested in maintainable software, but thinking about as new tooling is coming out, I think it's great.</p><p>We keep building new tools, but it actually becomes. For all of us software engineers, wherever we're like, well, we need to upgrade to this new thing because that's the new thing that everybody's talking about. And there's not enough emphasis on like, how do I help take care of this stuff that was already working, that our apps are already reliably working with, you know, our customers or our clients have already invested time and money into like everybody chasing the next shiny new thing.</p><p>And I'm like, what about the thing that's already working? How can we refactor that? How can we iterate on that? How can we make sure that those gems are getting more support? Maintainers I maintain. And I created an open source project. It's exhausting to take care of projects for a long time. And so I think we need more in the Ruby ecosystem, less new gems, more emphasis on helping participate in helping take over projects or just helping those maintainers push things forward or help offer to volunteer and things like that.</p><p>Teaching people how to like migrate these things, how to handle upgrades. So that's the next new shiny object. Isn't the thing that we're trying to compete with? I think the 0.1 of my comrades over here, I was saying here was just, we're trying to make the developer experience great. And we can be a little lazy and we are being lazy as a community at times.</p><p>And I think we owe it to ourselves and to our future. To take care of the stuff that we've already invested a lot of time and energy and </p><p>[00:19:08] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Brittany, </p><p>[00:19:09] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> I think that's a really interesting take Robbie and it kind of makes me question, you know, in order to grow out the Ruby community, we have to do one of two things.</p><p>We either need to introduce new people into the community who haven't been here before. Or we need to try to re-acquire the community members who have left for other languages and frameworks. And so the question is if we make the software more maintainable, are we going to be able to coax back the members that we've lost in the past?</p><p>Like, is it our job to educate how things are better and really are things about. </p><p>[00:19:39] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Nick the Y quote, you pointed to brought up, tastes as being exclusionary. I wonder if anyone has thoughts, in what ways are we as a Ruby community being </p><p>[00:19:48] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> exclusionary? </p><p>[00:19:49] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> This is maybe a crappy take, but rails being the only web framework in Ruby sometimes feels a bit exclusionary.</p><p>I like there a NAMI there Sinatra, but people associate Ruby with rails and that's fine. Through accent. Like I very much love rails and obviously, but I do think there's value to be had from like having alternatives and being able to learn from other people and different ideas. I wasn't around for Merv rails, merger, the murderer.</p><p>But I think I would have liked to have been because they were like competing ideas that became one, and I think that would help push Ruby </p><p>[00:20:30] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> forward. </p><p>[00:20:32] <strong>Colleen Schnettler:</strong> So I think it's simpler than that. I do these weekly mentorship calls with junior developers. And I usually get like 15 to 20 and a call and none of them are rails developers.</p><p>And I think because we need more junior level rails jobs, people are going to go where the money is. We all need to make money. If you look, I mean, even as us as we've hired people, we don't hire junior developers. We don't, especially in rails. I mean, I know I'm being real specific, but I think part of that is because these applications are.</p><p>A little more legacy, a little bit older, you need to have more context. And so I feel like the problem is solvable at the basic level and that's, we need to hire people </p><p>[00:21:16] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> better than. And to add onto that. Here's a call to action. Everyone listening, you and your company are in a position to argue for and to promote and to do whatever you want to call it, to get more junior engineers into your company.</p><p>And it's kind of. Management and the senior developers who create and prove that you can have an ecosystem where juniors can thrive. They can learn the way you do rails. They can do all these things, but it really comes down to the people who are already in those positions to bring people into them, to throw the rope down, back after you're done using it and pull up people behind you.</p><p>And I really think we can say, oh, well, these companies need to change. But at the end of the day, it's the engineers in those companies who can facilitate this change and we need. </p><p>[00:22:03] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> Yeah. And like, plus plus, plus, plus I want to give credit and I won't call out people unless they want to talk about, but people at this table collectively have done so much to lift up juniors and give juniors opportunities.</p><p>And to give them a voice, I'd say, if you are listening to this, and if you're listening to this five years from now, randomly in a car, if you're just an engineer, you can give a voice to this in your company. I was hired. A self-taught Ruby list. And I got into the game in 2014 and it was the most isolating and difficult and painful time going from nobody's paying me to code to somebody, paying me anything to code, and it did difficult job.</p><p>And if you are able to facilitate even just one person every two years, you're making a huge impact in the universe. And this is something like, if there's anything, like, if you want me to just give you a shout out on Twitter, if you do this for the good of the community, Just an altruistic or there's something that we definitely believe in, and it's great for the community.</p><p>And thank you to all of you and everything that y'all have done for juniors over the years, Schwab </p><p>[00:23:01] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> he'll pay a hundred dollars per junior </p><p>[00:23:03] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> hire. Yeah, I will actually, yeah, I will. I will pay your company a hundred </p><p>[00:23:07] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> dollars and for those listening as well, another thing, if, if you're nervous about the idea of even bring out your first junior developer, bring in interns, do it once a quarter, building your team cycle, keeping them there for six, eight weeks time box it.</p><p>So. You know, there's an end period. Tell them that you're not hiring them at the end of that. It's like a period that you're going to pay them for six to eight weeks. That way you're not on the hook for that awkward conversation. When they say, do you want to keep me? Because you got to build in that kind of like that muscle of, because what ends up happening is you might hire that person.</p><p>Then you think I won't have time for the next person. So I'm actually a big advocate for having a regular internship cycles. So. It gets in the habit of having people come and go, because it also helps you improve your onboarding experience for new developers to your projects and build up that resilience amongst your team, that this is an expectation of the job.</p><p>Not something that we're going to think later down the road. So building internships first, serving in your junior developers, you can do that in parallel as well, but your junior developers have people to mentor immediately when you bring interns in. And so they're part of the process as well. And so that just levels.</p><p>So </p><p>[00:24:05] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> at Texas, we'll be hiring two junior backend developers this summer and juniors work well for us because we only hire seniors that are excited to mentor. I can't tell you how many times I have interviewed seniors that have been very technically savvy, but have clearly no interest in mentoring. And unfortunately that just won't work for us.</p><p>And so I think that's important that you have to establish that as a norm within your organization. </p><p>[00:24:29] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> So Chris Winslet, a long-term rails developer is asking, where is the front end going? What's happening to that in the future? Yeah, Andrew </p><p>[00:24:37] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Culver. I'm sure everybody up here has like an opinion about this and it's very relevant.</p><p>I think we're on the right track. I don't think that that excludes react view any of those other toolings, but I think if you go back to that original blog post about stimulus, this isn't exclusive to stimulus. It's a philosophy. What DHH articulated in that blog post, I think is one of the most significant things written in the 15 years that I've been doing software development.</p><p>It's more than that now, but in that I think there was a fork in the road where a lot of people started going too far to the front end, too much running in the client. The answer to that isn't react is bad. View is bad. Backbone was bad. Angular was. I think of, uh, somebody that I know military vet saw an opportunity in government for a piece of software that needed to be built and he built it.</p><p>It was really scrappy and it had angular. And then at some point there was a new feature. And so we used backbone for that. And then he used Ember and then he used react because each of those was the best tool for the job of the thing that he needed to build. But it was like bolted on top of a traditional rails model.</p><p>And so I think the world that we're in right now, sort of canonically in rails with like Hotwire or stimulus, reflex, and cable. Ready, those get you, I think 80%, 90% of the way there. And then if you still need, I work on apps with react bolted on top. I don't do that work, but I think that philosophy pulling out the heavy machinery is the quote from the blog post.</p><p>I think it's a solid answer </p><p>[00:26:23] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> web company. That's where the front end is going. In my opinion. Why, why? Because having this entire framework to do maybe this smaller thing, It's kind of going out of style, but what I think is coming more into style is this idea of atomic things that you can put anywhere.</p><p>And they work the same. I feel like that's the goal of just normal react components or something. It's like, oh, I can build this react component and I can use it everywhere, but that doesn't work in practice. Really. It's the same thing with like a rails partial. So I feel like we are trending more and more towards this idea of being able to like package the whole thing.</p><p>And ship it and then wherever it shipped to, it has the ability to be configured to work in that environment. </p><p>[00:27:07] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> So I'm curious on Andrew, do you feel that all rails developers should be full </p><p>[00:27:10] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> stack? Yes, </p><p>[00:27:11] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> I do. I don't have a stiff opinion on this, but I think that something that in wherever it goes, it needs to think of, I won't call anyone out.</p><p>I'll say people like me, people like me, who in the eyes of the law are full-stack people like me who run from CSS and JS, but we. And our happiest and the pure Rubin about blah, blah, blah. But we like that rails can help us from the beginning, build a thing. I need to concern myself with my business logic and the problem and the user and what I need to solve for them.</p><p>I need as little friction in the way. I'm glad that rails has moved, not just convention over configuration, but like having the support for all the ways that people want to build things. So they figured a friend who is an expert in a thing. They can build the thing on top, but we always need to make sure we support the ability to just build.</p><p>I mean, I'm very interested in the new tooling that's coming out, but maybe there's some front end whizzes in here who disagree with me. But as long as we think of the people who are full-stack, but not really, but want to be one person builders, as long as we keep servicing that community, then I think we got, it's </p><p>[00:28:15] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> going to sound like I'm sucking up because it's on the front row.</p><p>But view components are kind of a big piece for us, like at podia of moving forward. The thing I like five very fascinating about it is I actually. I'm going to be burned alive at the end of this, I actually kind of like react, but I don't like the JavaScript part of it, but I like the idea of components.</p><p>Sorry, sorry. I liked components, I guess it was on trying to say. And so I like the view component because things like sidecar assets where you can like attach JavaScript functionality, Sal sheets, it's kind of isolated. You can test it. I'm not saying like build your app with a full design system beginning as we've learned how to use them.</p><p>Like at podia, it's been very valuable because. Now people like me who are like Schwartz that in the eyes of the law considered full stack developers, like we can ship consistent interfaces and we're not as worried about how they look every time we're just rendering out components. And I really, I think that's a good way we're moving as well.</p><p>[00:29:15] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> One thing I'll say on that with the few components, I've also found. That there's anybody that that's out there looked at it and they're like, ah, I don't think view components are for me. I think partials also answer some great questions. Like you can go very far just with partials, so you don't have to go to some crazy front end framework.</p><p>We've got a lot of tools on the backend, but it all falls under that umbrella of like HTML over the wire. I do think that that's a good place to be. Joe </p><p>[00:29:45] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> is asking how can we as open source developers or maintainers? Invite more folks, especially those who are underrepresented to contribute to the open-source community.</p><p>Yeah, </p><p>[00:29:56] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> Brittany, I think it is inviting those guests onto the show. My first episode that I ever recorded with Nick was his first poll request into rails. And we just dug into what that meant and how like he navigated it and discussing with their contributor. And just really trying to lower the bar and make it clear that it's accessible to everybody, but also making it clear to you, invite guests on that work on smaller projects.</p><p>They don't have to be these large, big public projects and then encouraging them as well. Like after you wrap up that episode, Hey, have you considered, you know, supplying this Ruby weekly, they're always looking for content. So get your name out. The other </p><p>[00:30:33] <strong>Chris Oliver:</strong> thing, another thing is like, you know, as a maintainer, there's a lot of things that are easy for you to fix that are quick, just like intentionally not do them and label it as a good contribution for somebody new and kind of work the process.</p><p>If somebody is not sure how the flow goes, like have a whole kind of script of star here, work through it, write it down, like all the edge cases that you need to think of and leave those opportunities open, even though like you could fix it in five minutes yourself. It's nice to be able to have. Some of those, you know, left open on purpose.</p><p>[00:31:11] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> I think we need to do more with all of our employers campaign, hard to donate substantially more amounts of money to the open-source projects that you use. I'm not talking 500 bucks. I'm not talking 500 bucks a month. I'm talking like we're going to dedicate 50 grand to this project that we get substantial economic value.</p><p>I work on such a project, right? So I have an open source framework that people use on top of rails and we have substantial financial backing on the source side. And that doesn't all go to me that goes out to like seven or eight developers that help me on a regular basis. One of them it's the first professional Ruby he's ever written in his life.</p><p>He's a English teacher in Japan. And so that comes from. And so I look at the projects when that was a commercial framework. And I look at the libraries that we use to support. And at 500 bucks a month to some of those projects that we were supporting, we were the highest pain contributor. That's ridiculous.</p><p>We have to have a serious conversation. If we want to talk about getting juniors into open source contributions, we need to make a disconnect between open source being unpaid. We have so much money in the businesses that we're in. We're raising so much venture capital. We have so high margins let's donate more money to open source projects.</p><p>Now, just to put </p><p>[00:32:40] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> in a little bit, a couple </p><p>[00:32:41] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> of thoughts, number one, just write this down. If you're not already aware code triaged.com and then just go and look at it later. But if you're going to mentor a junior without it, it allows you to pick a couple of repository. And act settings and just like one polar request a week, I'll just get sent to your inbox.</p><p>You can look at it and maybe it's somebody who has been ignored for years and you can like dig into that and learn a bit more. But it's passive first. You have to get that passive contributor experience going down, but what's the goal. Where am I trying to get with this as a junior or senior or an intermediate while I like this term.</p><p>And I use a lot privately become an open source civilian. We're not all going to be full-time. Paid to maintain a thing, or some people very luckily are heavily in that, but I feel like we all have a duty as to be an open source civilian, and it's more than just like, oh, I found a bug it's like that passive work.</p><p>And maybe just pick a couple of things to participate in. Now the final, I think directly to your point, what can we as casters, besides me just saying. What can we, as podcasters do to further that? I think we need to normalize that. I think we need to make sure that we do what we think people should do.</p><p>And then we talk about it because I had listened to podcasts for many years before I ever was on, on, I lived in the country. I didn't talk to Rubius. So I really influenced how I thought about things. Like I remember listening to Derek Pryor and Sage Griffin years and years ago on bike shed and what they talked about.</p><p>Their opinions and how they acted in their life. Really informed how I thought I ought to talk and act and we can do the same to say, oh yeah, yeah, that was just on blah, blah, blah repository. And I have to look at this PR firm a couple of years ago that got him from code triaged. She said that a couple of times people will be doing the same.</p><p>It lowers the barrier. It makes it just a few hours a month and it becomes a good thing you can do, but like mowing your yard. </p><p>[00:34:26] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> I was going to say that one other strategy. I created this thing called once upon a time. There's been a couple thousand people that have contributed to the main project. I don't know how that's managed to happen, but there's a lot, but a lot of participation from people.</p><p>And I think that project makes it easier for people to participate for. Sometimes it's quite often their first open-source project that they've contributed to. I didn't do anything intentionally. I don't have to feel like I have the secrets. At all there. But one thing that I have seen work effectively for me and other people that are helping maintain the project is we've had universities reach out to us.</p><p>We've had small groups reach out to us. And so when they're like, Hey, we have this idea. We want to participate in, help, get involved in open source project. Can we help contribute to and inquire about this? And we'll be like, all right, well, cool. We're, we're gonna end up working with like three to five people.</p><p>We can work on like a project. Maybe there's some ideas we've had for a while. It's sitting in the backlog. We haven't got to go through and review those things yet, or work on some new things. Your gut, some features when we do it in that sort of way, that's made it easier for us to kind of wrap our head around it.</p><p>Cause we're not then. So just to saying like, I think it's really important to try to help the individuals that reach out to you and want to contribute. But if you're listening and you're like, I want to contribute, try to maybe find a few people that you'd want to contribute together with, and then you can approach a project and be like, Hey, we're a little more organized.</p><p>We've got three of us. Someone's going to be a point of contact. This is what we're hoping to accomplish. This is our. What can we work on? How can we help your project move forward? That makes it way easier for me as a project maintainer, to figure out how I'm gonna wrap my head around what the goal is.</p><p>And again, this is like a timebox to it. They're going to get something further collectively, and then they're going to work amongst themselves as well. So they're, you know, they're, they're able to help themselves. And that has been a helpful way for me to bring in people outside of the people that is individually.</p><p>[00:36:07] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> We're going to take one more question. Before we wrap up, John Manel is asking, how can we make our development environment mimic our production environment, especially if it's quite. </p><p>[00:36:18] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> If somebody says, Docker, I'm outta here, Docker, you can use Docker, but your battery will last </p><p>[00:36:23] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> for four hours. It's true. And I think we've always said that, you know, I've done episodes on this, where we talk about having something like the deployment, where it's just baked into the framework.</p><p>And I truly don't believe that we're anywhere near that. It is a really good question. I feel your frustration, John, like it's really difficult to solve a bug when it's only something that's going to be present in the ecosystem that you've built in production. And let's not joke around. You might have read is going Alaska, search a CDN.</p><p>There's just a lot of stuff. And to try to clone that locally as really </p><p>[00:36:53] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> difficult, I got to take the position that I don't think rails should solve that. I feel like if you're building out a SAS, there's like patterns you can follow. And I don't feel like that should be baked into rails. We've had Capistrano.</p><p>We saw projects that we deployed with Capistrano. It works great for those projects. And, but we have a lot of ones that I'm like, I don't understand what happens when we push this stuff to a branch. Some magic happens, someone else made that stuff work and they don't understand the pipelines. That's okay.</p><p>I'm not answering your question, but I don't feel like that should be a rails thing because I don't think we should have a strong opinion about where it gets deployed, but it gets back to the point around the development environment. Those are trade offs that each of those organizations, especially larger organizations.</p><p>If you got an engineering team of 50 to a hundred people. We just wrapped up doing our biannual Ruby on rails survey, community survey, and the growing is like 11% or something. I don't remember the exact number. Our company had, 11% of teams are like 50 plus engineers right now. Or maybe it's like 14% or something like that.</p><p>That's a lot of people, a lot of systems are probably in place. And so it's not going to be like, oh, this is really great. When there was like three of us on a team and we could all get everything up and running in like five minutes on our machines. No. How do we connect all these differences? We have serverless stuff.</p><p>What is serverless even mean? But, um, so there's a lot of challenges there. I think that those are trade offs that each company is going to need to make in terms of infrastructure. And I don't know that developers should be always be the ones that are making long-term hosting solutions necessarily either kinda make decisions for the </p><p>organization.</p><p>[00:38:12] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> It's funny that Bernie said active deployment because in one of my first podcasts, in like 2018, maybe 2019, we had a guest who. Specifically named it active deployment. I'm pretty sure. So it's funny that we're still having this conversation, even though I feel like the ecosystem is getting better and better, there's more and more services to deploy your app.</p><p>Like hatch box, fly render. I mean, you can keep going and going and going and going. So I don't feel like deployments getting harder. I feel like developers are complicating their setups more than they need to. And I feel like that's part of the problem. </p><p>[00:38:45] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Also, my dig at Docker was a joke. I don't love it. I use it every.</p><p>Because of some of the complicated infrastructure stuff. So </p><p>[00:38:53] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Chris Oliver, any thoughts there, it's </p><p>[00:38:55] <strong>Chris Oliver:</strong> one of those things where, as a developer, you don't want to have to worry about the operation sides of things. You know, if you could get away without Docker and just have everything running and you have your dependencies and all that, that would be awesome.</p><p>But yeah. At some point somebody's going, gonna kind of come up with a, an alternative to Docker that can probably mimic that a bit better. They're still solving a lot of problems on Docker itself. And I think eventually we'll see it, it probably won't come out of the rails ecosystem itself. It's kind of more of a DevOpsy area to work in.</p><p>And so I feel like we're oftentimes just consumers of that activity that's going on instead of. Creating those things ourselves and the community. So part of me just feels like, you know, waiting for changes to happen and stuff like that. </p><p>[00:39:46] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> One thing I want to point out, it's not directly related to what you're saying, but I think it's really exciting.</p><p>And Chris didn't mention it because it isn't directly related. But I think when you look at hatch box, how many infrastructure companies can you think of all of those companies that are doing interesting infrastructure, things that are boots. The only ones I can think of are layer of L forge and you've got hatch box and that baby was grown in the rails ecosystem.</p><p>And I don't think he's done yet. So I think there are exciting things happening in infrastructure, and I think that they can happen in the rails ecosystem. And I think that can be a call to action to anybody that's listening to this. So </p><p>[00:40:26] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> we have very many calls to action and that's a full cap. I just want to say thank you so much to all of our listeners, always, and especially the ones who are present today, watching this panel and thank you to everyone on the panel for being a part of it. .</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Live from Portland at rails comp 2020. We're recording a podcast panel crossover episode. I'm Gemma is off one of the co-hosts of the Ruby on rails podcast. I'll be moderating this panel. We have five podcasts represented here across eight panelists. We're going to go around to start and hear what all everyone is excited about.</p><p>For rails comp. First up, we have Brittany Martin from the Ruby on rails podcast. Brittany, what talker workshop are you most looking forward to? </p><p>[00:00:29] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> I have to admit I'm going to go with a meta answer and it's going to be this panel, but also as well to make a switch track, which I ended up curating. We already saw Joel Hawksley gave a fantastic talk as well as David Hill.</p><p>And I'm just excited for that track to continue. </p><p>[00:00:44] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Sounds great. Looking forward to hearing the rest. Next up, we have Robbie Russell of maintainable software podcast. </p><p>[00:00:51] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> Hello, I'm enjoying so far. The, uh, what does it talk to me like I'm five or I forgot the way it's titled, but yeah, the tracks there have been really great in terms of getting down to some of the basics and such.</p><p>And so. Kind of mandating most of my teams at, and those ones in particular, if they can do which ones have you been to so far? I just sat in the rails console one and I learned a few things that I didn't know about or I'd forgotten about like using jobs in rails console is pretty fun having sub-processes and there was one earlier on maintaining rails applications.</p><p>I really enjoyed that one. Next up </p><p>[00:01:26] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Andrew Culver from framework friends. </p><p>[00:01:28] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Yeah. So for me, conferences are about people. And so I'm kind of notorious for hanging out in the hallway, track, all attend a few talks, but mostly like for the limited time that I'm here, I come in late. I leave real early. Cause I got kids that I got to get back to back home.</p><p>But for the time that I'm here, I just try to have as much face time with, you know, everybody like who's in the room right now. </p><p>[00:01:50] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Nick swatter, Ruby on rails pod. </p><p>[00:01:53] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> I'll do </p><p>[00:01:53] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> two things. One, I like trails con for me, his bag. I'm just so hyped for it. I'll call out. Hi, joined the Ruby community in first week of March, 2014 and never been to rails comp.</p><p>I've like followed the content for eight. So it's such a treat to be here by will to honor your question, pick a specific thing. I'm excited to see the remote group began talking about a pocket while I won't spoil anything. I love our community, but seeing people not just carving out their niche, but like helping to grow more of things in the community to make it sustainable, to make it more welcoming and open to more people.</p><p>And so I'm absolutely, as you're saying, the UK buzzing to see, and I agree began, </p><p>[00:02:31] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> and there's a whole </p><p>[00:02:32] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> community content. Speaking of remote Ruby, Andrew Mason. </p><p>[00:02:36] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> Yeah, what's up everybody. I was excited for Joel Hawksley's talk, which is great. Joel, again, Joe's in the audience for anyone listening. I'm excited for Schwan's talk because Schwab always gives amazing talks.</p><p>I'm always excited for Brittany's talk and Britney's not giving a talk this month. So that's why I'm excited to hear her </p><p>[00:02:54] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> here. Uh, next up </p><p>[00:02:56] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Jason. Tarryn's. </p><p>[00:02:59] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> Hello? </p><p>[00:03:01] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> Well, I feel like any answer I have now would just be cheating. I too very much like the hallway track and the people, I very much enjoy Joel sock.</p><p>Dave, Copeland's giving one. I'm really looking forward to the one I'm least looking forward to is the remote Ruby </p><p>[00:03:13] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> talk. </p><p>[00:03:15] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> Oh. And </p><p>[00:03:16] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> I'm excited that Aaron Francis is here so we can talk about Laravel this whole </p><p>[00:03:18] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> time. </p><p>[00:03:21] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Also have remote with me. We have Chris Oliver next. </p><p>[00:03:24] <strong>Chris Oliver:</strong> I'm just so excited to like put faces to Twitter, avatars and discord and everything had conversations with so many people.</p><p>And then finally getting to meet them in person is the best. That's what I'm looking forward to the most. </p><p>[00:03:37] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> And we have Colleen Chandler from the software social </p><p>[00:03:40] <strong>Colleen Schnettler:</strong> podcast. I am super excited about my workshop, which is coming up in 45 minutes, filling an advanced query builder with active record. And there's actually quite a few active record talks here this week.</p><p>So I'm super pumped for those. I'm really looking forward </p><p>[00:03:56] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> to it. So next question I have is why podcast, and maybe we can get into the community content track a little, or, or what's going on. </p><p>[00:04:04] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> Yep, Brittany. So I love its ability to be a time capsule. And it's so cool to have a timeline of my own career, but it's even cooler to watch my co-hosts career.</p><p>Nick's first episode was September, 2018. He was a regular guest, and then he became official cohost in 2021. And then Gemma's first episode was in March, 2021 and then became a cohost also in 2021. And each have had like a really unique path to Shopify and establishing themselves more in the community.</p><p>And. I feel really grateful that I have an opportunity to talk </p><p>to </p><p>[00:04:36] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> them regularly about it. We feel grateful for the same remote Ruby. I know you're doing a whole talk on podcasting. Do you want to give us a little preview? </p><p>[00:04:46] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> All are they intrude? If the preview? </p><p>[00:04:48] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I think podcasting is a great way to kind of reach a very large audience without as much overhead as producing videos.</p><p>So our talk is basically on how to start a podcast and it's tailored towards Ruby, but it's going to be about kind of our journey to starting one kind of the lessons that we've learned, because I've, at this point I've been on three. Jason. And Chris started remote Ravi men. Then I joined them later. So I think we have individually a lot to share with the community to help them not fall into the same traps that we did.</p><p>So that's our goal is to like help encourage people to start their own podcast and do it in a way that they can avoid some of the huge mistakes that we've made over the years. </p><p>[00:05:29] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> What are some of the mistakes? </p><p>[00:05:31] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> It takes a team. In my opinion, to produce a great podcast from editors, from doing marketing, doing show notes, you know, there's so many aspects of it and having cohos.</p><p>And if you only have two co-hosts one person doesn't show up, what do you do then you skip a week. I think consistency is really important and it's kind of back to us about having a team. And when you don't have that team in place, it can really produce a lot of heartache and headache. And a lot of after hours work on the podcast, which is not the goal.</p><p>And it really detracts from the. Colleen, </p><p>[00:06:02] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> do you have a similar view on podcasting? So </p><p>[00:06:05] <strong>Colleen Schnettler:</strong> one of the things I love about podcasting is this concept of luck, surface area. And it's this concept that the more visible you are, the more opportunities come your way. I'm a self-taught developer. And when I got into software, everyone's like, you should blog.</p><p>You should blog. I could not get into blogging. I just could not get into a good routine. I didn't like it. And then I started podcast. Random people on the internet, listen to the podcast and then people recognize you and then they know you. And I have found for me like professionally, first of all, I love it.</p><p>Cause I do a podcast with someone who I'm already friends with, but professionally like opportunities start coming your way as you become more visible. And I think it's a very low friction way to become more visible </p><p>[00:06:53] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Andrew yet. Do you have similar thoughts? </p><p>[00:06:54] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Yeah. So for me. We were already having conversations.</p><p>So Aaron and I were already chatting. And so by just hitting record, they gave us this opportunity to kind of like share that. I kind of had a sense, like, yeah, people might find this interesting what you can't. If for anybody that's listening, there are so many podcasts. You have friends like Justin Jackson and like his whole life, his podcasts, because there's so many of them.</p><p>And so anybody that thinks that they have a unique take on something, if you're thinking about starting a podcast, start a podcast, just do it because what you can't know. Before you do it before you start publishing, before you start sharing your ideas is who's going to come out of the woodwork. And yeah, we got like feedback from people that we knew, but we also met tons of people that we've never heard of before that reach out and say like, Hey, I love that.</p><p>And people that come up to you at conferences and say, Hey, you know that conversation that you had, I really identified with that. That really captured something that I had been thinking about. And until you start publishing stuff, you can't know if that's going to happen. And it's so low friction, like unlike blogging, which it takes a ton of time.</p><p>We were already having the conversation. So you just hit record and you publish it. And then I think the other piece of it as well, which for folks who have guests on their podcast, it's amazing. To think that you can provide infrastructure for super smart people, people that are way smarter than me, you can get them on.</p><p>We had a guy say this to us recently where he didn't want to reach out to people and be like, Hey, can I come on your podcast? But he said, but reach out every six months because I might have something to say. And so the idea that you can get an audio. And then you can share with that audience, the incredible thinking of people that may only want to do a podcast a couple times a year.</p><p>That's another thing that I love about the medium. </p><p>[00:08:51] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> So the ability to enable others or to push others forward. Yeah. You mentioned feedback a few times hearing from your listeners. I know that something that it's tough to do as a podcast host, it's tough to figure out where your listeners are and how they talk to you.</p><p>Does anyone have thoughts on that? </p><p>[00:09:09] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Twitter is the best thing ever. I live on Twitter. And so when you open your DMS, make it easy for people to send you messages. Yeah. Just open that sucker right up. Robbie, have you </p><p>[00:09:20] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> had similar experiences? </p><p>[00:09:22] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> You know, Twitter is helpful. So I do encourage people to email me as well.</p><p>Mike format doing more of like interview style and fairly. Topics, but just a broad range of different people. So, but the angle that I, you know, if it's terms of communication, it's also, but it's going to be lonely as a podcast or not. You don't hear often, sometimes we'll post stuff on Twitter and hopefully the guests will reshare that and their network, or we'll help interact with that.</p><p>But there's other areas I've found like some interaction over like Reddit. Sometimes I'll post the links there as well, and try to use some controversial title for the episode, just to kind of provoke people a little. That tends to help a little bit as well. Those are some areas, but I do get a lot of emails and occasional DMS and stuff from people.</p><p>[00:10:06] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Banana thought. </p><p>[00:10:07] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> Yeah, for me, I used to have a very loyal listener who would tell me about how terrible my audio was. And I so appreciated them for it because I was learning. And then as I tweak things, I would have sessions with them. And then eventually when we hired a professional editor, he reached out to me and told me how proud he was of me.</p><p>And then he would just really believed in the podcast. He held on for all that time that I was learning, but I will say too, the greatest joy for me, I will echo Andrew is when I'm on Twitter and someone will tweet an inside joke from an episode and bring it back. Like we get jokes about goo. We get jokes about treading water.</p><p>It's really fun for me to share those jokes with those lists of. I </p><p>[00:10:47] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> think you can be the source of your own feedback as well. I say time and time again, like I'm the only one who listens every single week when our podcast listens, I listened to it and that is a way for me to find errors in the way I speak things that I do when I speak like arm, like, and, uh, and things like that also is if you solicit.</p><p>Kind of going back to what Robbie was saying, that's another great way to get it. And I've also said that when you get that feedback, it may not always be positive and it may not mean that you need to change anything. Not all negative feedback means that, oh, I should adjust this because this one person doesn't like the way we do.</p><p>[00:11:23] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> I was just going to say on the, like, asking for people to do reviews, I've found that if I kind of repeat that over and over, it's kind of becomes an echo chamber of nothing. It's hard to get reviews on apple podcasts and other places. I don't even know where else people were telling me, but go anywhere is stitch.</p><p>You're still thinking. Do you know, sometimes I'll just kind of go a little off script and then I'll be like, or write something and some chalk on the sidewalk. And then someone sent me a photo that they did that they were like, oh cool. I got a nice review on some sidewalk in someone's neighborhood. So thank you.</p><p>Whoever that was. </p><p>[00:11:54] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> And feedback is definitely a gift. It's taken me a long time for me to learn that in like most areas. Like, y'all listen to podcasts. I listen to podcasts. It's quite a big commitment to carve out a half hour, 20, 30 minutes, 60 minutes of your day, especially in a remote world where you don't commute.</p><p>So we don't have that cheat code as often anymore. And so most people, if they're unhappy, what do you do? You just switch off? So like how much does somebody care to? Actually, even if it comes off as quite terse with feedback, sometimes it can either be, well, if it's true, why are you offended? And if it's not true, then hire you.</p><p>Because not true. I'd always things for me. Any feedback on anything? This is not even just in podcast, but if you can try and wrap a Colonel out of it and make something positive, it's might be one of the nicest things you hear. </p><p>[00:12:37] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Switching gears a little bit. Chris Oliver, what do you love about the Ruby ecosystem?</p><p>[00:12:42] <strong>Chris Oliver:</strong> A lot, probably the people the most beside from that, there's something about the Ruby ecosystem that started in entrepreneurship and. The language itself has kinda like designed around humans first, which is unique and rare. So it's all kind of around people and stuff. Hey, </p><p>[00:13:02] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> what else have thoughts here?</p><p>Andrew Kovar. </p><p>[00:13:05] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> So I think the thing that attracted me to the Ruby ecosystem like 10, 12 years ago now it was tooling. And I think that comes back to what Chris is talking about. That it's a human. Maths is nice. So we are nice, like the whole Mina Swan thing. And then the way that, that bubbles up, I think into rails, since we're at rails comp, as a framework is the developer experience.</p><p>It's like a framework that was developed with empathy for the way that you would interact with it. And that was different than a lot of what existed at the time. And I think other frameworks have taken inspiration from that. And we certainly don't have a monopoly on developer experience. I think we can look to other frameworks for inspiration.</p><p>There is. But the focus on tooling, you know, it, it's interesting. There's a white quote. I'm probably going to butcher it a little bit, but I think there's actually like a lesson to be learned from it. So one of the things that Y said toward the end of his tenure was software. So unrewarding to write something and then a year later it gets replaced by something better.</p><p>And then a few more years go by and it doesn't run at all. It doesn't run at all. There's an inverse way. Of looking at that quote. And that is that our stuff's always getting better. There isn't a monopoly on anything and you can always propose a new, a better way. And we're the beneficiaries of that. And because there's that focus on developer experience that keeps driving us forward rails continues to compete.</p><p>It continues to be like, I think it is still to this day, the best way to launch SAS applications specifically. And so that's one of the things that I love about rails and love about the community. It's that focus on people </p><p>[00:14:50] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> what's missing. And we have a foremost why expert, I think probably in the world next to you, who is nodding along.</p><p>So I think we can say that quote was all good. What's missing that next year or the next year or the next year we might see in the community. Jason. </p><p>[00:15:04] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> So they talked about Ruby cough, but Andrew is talking about. But like tooling, it's kind of stagnated. It feels like. And the Ruby community, Ruby ecosystem, and like they were talking about Ruby three's focuses on developer experience.</p><p>There are times I've considered not writing Ruby. I watched these other people work in languages and they can do amazing things like amazing refactorings and then even things like suggestions. And I'm like, I'm still writing the same Ruby code I'm writing five years ago. So I think that's something we can improve on for sure.</p><p>And I think they're trying, so that's </p><p>[00:15:36] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> encouraging, I think this will lead into another white quote from it's the similar time which was, and I think that's applies for our community. If you don't create, you become defined by your tastes and your tastes can only alienate other people. So create. And I think that that's something that we can, we have a mature ecosystem.</p><p>Now we can really be lazy if we want. And I think the railway is awesome. Like the Ruby way is awesome, but I think we can now put the manta on our shoulders and create, even if it's just fantastic, interesting new jams, be the content we want to see in the world. And that goes with podcasting. It goes with open source.</p><p>I really feel Jason saying. And I think that part of that solution would be to continue to create new and innovative things. I think there's definitely a lot of room for that. We could definitely stagnate and make awesome SAS apps, crowed SAS apps all the time with rails, but I think there's a lot more innovation </p><p>[00:16:26] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> and fun to be had.</p><p>I think that's a call to action. I think that's what for anybody that's listening to that if that resonates with you, I think we're just scratching the surface. Of what we can do to make it easier for people to develop software. It's such a lucrative opportunity. I have like a physical product business as well, and the margins are terrible.</p><p>It's so awful. And like when I sold my first SAS business, the margins, when we went through due diligence for like 95%, we operated at a 95% profit margin. That is an opportunity that we should be trying to get in. And we haven't even scratched the surface of all the SAS software that can be written with rails.</p><p>You can find a mission in it in creating better tooling, higher levels of abstraction, greater developer experience and usability so that we can give these tools the best set of tools to a greater set of people so they can improve their economic situation. A single person building a SAS app can change their life.</p><p>And I think we've got the best tool to give to people for that. </p><p>[00:17:33] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Yeah. Or even I would argue, uh, enable people to build their own tools that can lift them up. Robbie, do you have thought there, </p><p>[00:17:40] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> I'm going, go ahead down a little bit of lemon here and say that I disagree with everybody. To an extent I'm actually more interested in maintainable software, but thinking about as new tooling is coming out, I think it's great.</p><p>We keep building new tools, but it actually becomes. For all of us software engineers, wherever we're like, well, we need to upgrade to this new thing because that's the new thing that everybody's talking about. And there's not enough emphasis on like, how do I help take care of this stuff that was already working, that our apps are already reliably working with, you know, our customers or our clients have already invested time and money into like everybody chasing the next shiny new thing.</p><p>And I'm like, what about the thing that's already working? How can we refactor that? How can we iterate on that? How can we make sure that those gems are getting more support? Maintainers I maintain. And I created an open source project. It's exhausting to take care of projects for a long time. And so I think we need more in the Ruby ecosystem, less new gems, more emphasis on helping participate in helping take over projects or just helping those maintainers push things forward or help offer to volunteer and things like that.</p><p>Teaching people how to like migrate these things, how to handle upgrades. So that's the next new shiny object. Isn't the thing that we're trying to compete with? I think the 0.1 of my comrades over here, I was saying here was just, we're trying to make the developer experience great. And we can be a little lazy and we are being lazy as a community at times.</p><p>And I think we owe it to ourselves and to our future. To take care of the stuff that we've already invested a lot of time and energy and </p><p>[00:19:08] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Brittany, </p><p>[00:19:09] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> I think that's a really interesting take Robbie and it kind of makes me question, you know, in order to grow out the Ruby community, we have to do one of two things.</p><p>We either need to introduce new people into the community who haven't been here before. Or we need to try to re-acquire the community members who have left for other languages and frameworks. And so the question is if we make the software more maintainable, are we going to be able to coax back the members that we've lost in the past?</p><p>Like, is it our job to educate how things are better and really are things about. </p><p>[00:19:39] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Nick the Y quote, you pointed to brought up, tastes as being exclusionary. I wonder if anyone has thoughts, in what ways are we as a Ruby community being </p><p>[00:19:48] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> exclusionary? </p><p>[00:19:49] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> This is maybe a crappy take, but rails being the only web framework in Ruby sometimes feels a bit exclusionary.</p><p>I like there a NAMI there Sinatra, but people associate Ruby with rails and that's fine. Through accent. Like I very much love rails and obviously, but I do think there's value to be had from like having alternatives and being able to learn from other people and different ideas. I wasn't around for Merv rails, merger, the murderer.</p><p>But I think I would have liked to have been because they were like competing ideas that became one, and I think that would help push Ruby </p><p>[00:20:30] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> forward. </p><p>[00:20:32] <strong>Colleen Schnettler:</strong> So I think it's simpler than that. I do these weekly mentorship calls with junior developers. And I usually get like 15 to 20 and a call and none of them are rails developers.</p><p>And I think because we need more junior level rails jobs, people are going to go where the money is. We all need to make money. If you look, I mean, even as us as we've hired people, we don't hire junior developers. We don't, especially in rails. I mean, I know I'm being real specific, but I think part of that is because these applications are.</p><p>A little more legacy, a little bit older, you need to have more context. And so I feel like the problem is solvable at the basic level and that's, we need to hire people </p><p>[00:21:16] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> better than. And to add onto that. Here's a call to action. Everyone listening, you and your company are in a position to argue for and to promote and to do whatever you want to call it, to get more junior engineers into your company.</p><p>And it's kind of. Management and the senior developers who create and prove that you can have an ecosystem where juniors can thrive. They can learn the way you do rails. They can do all these things, but it really comes down to the people who are already in those positions to bring people into them, to throw the rope down, back after you're done using it and pull up people behind you.</p><p>And I really think we can say, oh, well, these companies need to change. But at the end of the day, it's the engineers in those companies who can facilitate this change and we need. </p><p>[00:22:03] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> Yeah. And like, plus plus, plus, plus I want to give credit and I won't call out people unless they want to talk about, but people at this table collectively have done so much to lift up juniors and give juniors opportunities.</p><p>And to give them a voice, I'd say, if you are listening to this, and if you're listening to this five years from now, randomly in a car, if you're just an engineer, you can give a voice to this in your company. I was hired. A self-taught Ruby list. And I got into the game in 2014 and it was the most isolating and difficult and painful time going from nobody's paying me to code to somebody, paying me anything to code, and it did difficult job.</p><p>And if you are able to facilitate even just one person every two years, you're making a huge impact in the universe. And this is something like, if there's anything, like, if you want me to just give you a shout out on Twitter, if you do this for the good of the community, Just an altruistic or there's something that we definitely believe in, and it's great for the community.</p><p>And thank you to all of you and everything that y'all have done for juniors over the years, Schwab </p><p>[00:23:01] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> he'll pay a hundred dollars per junior </p><p>[00:23:03] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> hire. Yeah, I will actually, yeah, I will. I will pay your company a hundred </p><p>[00:23:07] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> dollars and for those listening as well, another thing, if, if you're nervous about the idea of even bring out your first junior developer, bring in interns, do it once a quarter, building your team cycle, keeping them there for six, eight weeks time box it.</p><p>So. You know, there's an end period. Tell them that you're not hiring them at the end of that. It's like a period that you're going to pay them for six to eight weeks. That way you're not on the hook for that awkward conversation. When they say, do you want to keep me? Because you got to build in that kind of like that muscle of, because what ends up happening is you might hire that person.</p><p>Then you think I won't have time for the next person. So I'm actually a big advocate for having a regular internship cycles. So. It gets in the habit of having people come and go, because it also helps you improve your onboarding experience for new developers to your projects and build up that resilience amongst your team, that this is an expectation of the job.</p><p>Not something that we're going to think later down the road. So building internships first, serving in your junior developers, you can do that in parallel as well, but your junior developers have people to mentor immediately when you bring interns in. And so they're part of the process as well. And so that just levels.</p><p>So </p><p>[00:24:05] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> at Texas, we'll be hiring two junior backend developers this summer and juniors work well for us because we only hire seniors that are excited to mentor. I can't tell you how many times I have interviewed seniors that have been very technically savvy, but have clearly no interest in mentoring. And unfortunately that just won't work for us.</p><p>And so I think that's important that you have to establish that as a norm within your organization. </p><p>[00:24:29] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> So Chris Winslet, a long-term rails developer is asking, where is the front end going? What's happening to that in the future? Yeah, Andrew </p><p>[00:24:37] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Culver. I'm sure everybody up here has like an opinion about this and it's very relevant.</p><p>I think we're on the right track. I don't think that that excludes react view any of those other toolings, but I think if you go back to that original blog post about stimulus, this isn't exclusive to stimulus. It's a philosophy. What DHH articulated in that blog post, I think is one of the most significant things written in the 15 years that I've been doing software development.</p><p>It's more than that now, but in that I think there was a fork in the road where a lot of people started going too far to the front end, too much running in the client. The answer to that isn't react is bad. View is bad. Backbone was bad. Angular was. I think of, uh, somebody that I know military vet saw an opportunity in government for a piece of software that needed to be built and he built it.</p><p>It was really scrappy and it had angular. And then at some point there was a new feature. And so we used backbone for that. And then he used Ember and then he used react because each of those was the best tool for the job of the thing that he needed to build. But it was like bolted on top of a traditional rails model.</p><p>And so I think the world that we're in right now, sort of canonically in rails with like Hotwire or stimulus, reflex, and cable. Ready, those get you, I think 80%, 90% of the way there. And then if you still need, I work on apps with react bolted on top. I don't do that work, but I think that philosophy pulling out the heavy machinery is the quote from the blog post.</p><p>I think it's a solid answer </p><p>[00:26:23] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> web company. That's where the front end is going. In my opinion. Why, why? Because having this entire framework to do maybe this smaller thing, It's kind of going out of style, but what I think is coming more into style is this idea of atomic things that you can put anywhere.</p><p>And they work the same. I feel like that's the goal of just normal react components or something. It's like, oh, I can build this react component and I can use it everywhere, but that doesn't work in practice. Really. It's the same thing with like a rails partial. So I feel like we are trending more and more towards this idea of being able to like package the whole thing.</p><p>And ship it and then wherever it shipped to, it has the ability to be configured to work in that environment. </p><p>[00:27:07] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> So I'm curious on Andrew, do you feel that all rails developers should be full </p><p>[00:27:10] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> stack? Yes, </p><p>[00:27:11] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> I do. I don't have a stiff opinion on this, but I think that something that in wherever it goes, it needs to think of, I won't call anyone out.</p><p>I'll say people like me, people like me, who in the eyes of the law are full-stack people like me who run from CSS and JS, but we. And our happiest and the pure Rubin about blah, blah, blah. But we like that rails can help us from the beginning, build a thing. I need to concern myself with my business logic and the problem and the user and what I need to solve for them.</p><p>I need as little friction in the way. I'm glad that rails has moved, not just convention over configuration, but like having the support for all the ways that people want to build things. So they figured a friend who is an expert in a thing. They can build the thing on top, but we always need to make sure we support the ability to just build.</p><p>I mean, I'm very interested in the new tooling that's coming out, but maybe there's some front end whizzes in here who disagree with me. But as long as we think of the people who are full-stack, but not really, but want to be one person builders, as long as we keep servicing that community, then I think we got, it's </p><p>[00:28:15] <strong>Jason Charnes:</strong> going to sound like I'm sucking up because it's on the front row.</p><p>But view components are kind of a big piece for us, like at podia of moving forward. The thing I like five very fascinating about it is I actually. I'm going to be burned alive at the end of this, I actually kind of like react, but I don't like the JavaScript part of it, but I like the idea of components.</p><p>Sorry, sorry. I liked components, I guess it was on trying to say. And so I like the view component because things like sidecar assets where you can like attach JavaScript functionality, Sal sheets, it's kind of isolated. You can test it. I'm not saying like build your app with a full design system beginning as we've learned how to use them.</p><p>Like at podia, it's been very valuable because. Now people like me who are like Schwartz that in the eyes of the law considered full stack developers, like we can ship consistent interfaces and we're not as worried about how they look every time we're just rendering out components. And I really, I think that's a good way we're moving as well.</p><p>[00:29:15] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> One thing I'll say on that with the few components, I've also found. That there's anybody that that's out there looked at it and they're like, ah, I don't think view components are for me. I think partials also answer some great questions. Like you can go very far just with partials, so you don't have to go to some crazy front end framework.</p><p>We've got a lot of tools on the backend, but it all falls under that umbrella of like HTML over the wire. I do think that that's a good place to be. Joe </p><p>[00:29:45] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> is asking how can we as open source developers or maintainers? Invite more folks, especially those who are underrepresented to contribute to the open-source community.</p><p>Yeah, </p><p>[00:29:56] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> Brittany, I think it is inviting those guests onto the show. My first episode that I ever recorded with Nick was his first poll request into rails. And we just dug into what that meant and how like he navigated it and discussing with their contributor. And just really trying to lower the bar and make it clear that it's accessible to everybody, but also making it clear to you, invite guests on that work on smaller projects.</p><p>They don't have to be these large, big public projects and then encouraging them as well. Like after you wrap up that episode, Hey, have you considered, you know, supplying this Ruby weekly, they're always looking for content. So get your name out. The other </p><p>[00:30:33] <strong>Chris Oliver:</strong> thing, another thing is like, you know, as a maintainer, there's a lot of things that are easy for you to fix that are quick, just like intentionally not do them and label it as a good contribution for somebody new and kind of work the process.</p><p>If somebody is not sure how the flow goes, like have a whole kind of script of star here, work through it, write it down, like all the edge cases that you need to think of and leave those opportunities open, even though like you could fix it in five minutes yourself. It's nice to be able to have. Some of those, you know, left open on purpose.</p><p>[00:31:11] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> I think we need to do more with all of our employers campaign, hard to donate substantially more amounts of money to the open-source projects that you use. I'm not talking 500 bucks. I'm not talking 500 bucks a month. I'm talking like we're going to dedicate 50 grand to this project that we get substantial economic value.</p><p>I work on such a project, right? So I have an open source framework that people use on top of rails and we have substantial financial backing on the source side. And that doesn't all go to me that goes out to like seven or eight developers that help me on a regular basis. One of them it's the first professional Ruby he's ever written in his life.</p><p>He's a English teacher in Japan. And so that comes from. And so I look at the projects when that was a commercial framework. And I look at the libraries that we use to support. And at 500 bucks a month to some of those projects that we were supporting, we were the highest pain contributor. That's ridiculous.</p><p>We have to have a serious conversation. If we want to talk about getting juniors into open source contributions, we need to make a disconnect between open source being unpaid. We have so much money in the businesses that we're in. We're raising so much venture capital. We have so high margins let's donate more money to open source projects.</p><p>Now, just to put </p><p>[00:32:40] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> in a little bit, a couple </p><p>[00:32:41] <strong>Nick Schwaderer:</strong> of thoughts, number one, just write this down. If you're not already aware code triaged.com and then just go and look at it later. But if you're going to mentor a junior without it, it allows you to pick a couple of repository. And act settings and just like one polar request a week, I'll just get sent to your inbox.</p><p>You can look at it and maybe it's somebody who has been ignored for years and you can like dig into that and learn a bit more. But it's passive first. You have to get that passive contributor experience going down, but what's the goal. Where am I trying to get with this as a junior or senior or an intermediate while I like this term.</p><p>And I use a lot privately become an open source civilian. We're not all going to be full-time. Paid to maintain a thing, or some people very luckily are heavily in that, but I feel like we all have a duty as to be an open source civilian, and it's more than just like, oh, I found a bug it's like that passive work.</p><p>And maybe just pick a couple of things to participate in. Now the final, I think directly to your point, what can we as casters, besides me just saying. What can we, as podcasters do to further that? I think we need to normalize that. I think we need to make sure that we do what we think people should do.</p><p>And then we talk about it because I had listened to podcasts for many years before I ever was on, on, I lived in the country. I didn't talk to Rubius. So I really influenced how I thought about things. Like I remember listening to Derek Pryor and Sage Griffin years and years ago on bike shed and what they talked about.</p><p>Their opinions and how they acted in their life. Really informed how I thought I ought to talk and act and we can do the same to say, oh yeah, yeah, that was just on blah, blah, blah repository. And I have to look at this PR firm a couple of years ago that got him from code triaged. She said that a couple of times people will be doing the same.</p><p>It lowers the barrier. It makes it just a few hours a month and it becomes a good thing you can do, but like mowing your yard. </p><p>[00:34:26] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> I was going to say that one other strategy. I created this thing called once upon a time. There's been a couple thousand people that have contributed to the main project. I don't know how that's managed to happen, but there's a lot, but a lot of participation from people.</p><p>And I think that project makes it easier for people to participate for. Sometimes it's quite often their first open-source project that they've contributed to. I didn't do anything intentionally. I don't have to feel like I have the secrets. At all there. But one thing that I have seen work effectively for me and other people that are helping maintain the project is we've had universities reach out to us.</p><p>We've had small groups reach out to us. And so when they're like, Hey, we have this idea. We want to participate in, help, get involved in open source project. Can we help contribute to and inquire about this? And we'll be like, all right, well, cool. We're, we're gonna end up working with like three to five people.</p><p>We can work on like a project. Maybe there's some ideas we've had for a while. It's sitting in the backlog. We haven't got to go through and review those things yet, or work on some new things. Your gut, some features when we do it in that sort of way, that's made it easier for us to kind of wrap our head around it.</p><p>Cause we're not then. So just to saying like, I think it's really important to try to help the individuals that reach out to you and want to contribute. But if you're listening and you're like, I want to contribute, try to maybe find a few people that you'd want to contribute together with, and then you can approach a project and be like, Hey, we're a little more organized.</p><p>We've got three of us. Someone's going to be a point of contact. This is what we're hoping to accomplish. This is our. What can we work on? How can we help your project move forward? That makes it way easier for me as a project maintainer, to figure out how I'm gonna wrap my head around what the goal is.</p><p>And again, this is like a timebox to it. They're going to get something further collectively, and then they're going to work amongst themselves as well. So they're, you know, they're, they're able to help themselves. And that has been a helpful way for me to bring in people outside of the people that is individually.</p><p>[00:36:07] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> We're going to take one more question. Before we wrap up, John Manel is asking, how can we make our development environment mimic our production environment, especially if it's quite. </p><p>[00:36:18] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> If somebody says, Docker, I'm outta here, Docker, you can use Docker, but your battery will last </p><p>[00:36:23] <strong>Brittany Martin:</strong> for four hours. It's true. And I think we've always said that, you know, I've done episodes on this, where we talk about having something like the deployment, where it's just baked into the framework.</p><p>And I truly don't believe that we're anywhere near that. It is a really good question. I feel your frustration, John, like it's really difficult to solve a bug when it's only something that's going to be present in the ecosystem that you've built in production. And let's not joke around. You might have read is going Alaska, search a CDN.</p><p>There's just a lot of stuff. And to try to clone that locally as really </p><p>[00:36:53] <strong>Robby Russell:</strong> difficult, I got to take the position that I don't think rails should solve that. I feel like if you're building out a SAS, there's like patterns you can follow. And I don't feel like that should be baked into rails. We've had Capistrano.</p><p>We saw projects that we deployed with Capistrano. It works great for those projects. And, but we have a lot of ones that I'm like, I don't understand what happens when we push this stuff to a branch. Some magic happens, someone else made that stuff work and they don't understand the pipelines. That's okay.</p><p>I'm not answering your question, but I don't feel like that should be a rails thing because I don't think we should have a strong opinion about where it gets deployed, but it gets back to the point around the development environment. Those are trade offs that each of those organizations, especially larger organizations.</p><p>If you got an engineering team of 50 to a hundred people. We just wrapped up doing our biannual Ruby on rails survey, community survey, and the growing is like 11% or something. I don't remember the exact number. Our company had, 11% of teams are like 50 plus engineers right now. Or maybe it's like 14% or something like that.</p><p>That's a lot of people, a lot of systems are probably in place. And so it's not going to be like, oh, this is really great. When there was like three of us on a team and we could all get everything up and running in like five minutes on our machines. No. How do we connect all these differences? We have serverless stuff.</p><p>What is serverless even mean? But, um, so there's a lot of challenges there. I think that those are trade offs that each company is going to need to make in terms of infrastructure. And I don't know that developers should be always be the ones that are making long-term hosting solutions necessarily either kinda make decisions for the </p><p>organization.</p><p>[00:38:12] <strong>Andrew Mason:</strong> It's funny that Bernie said active deployment because in one of my first podcasts, in like 2018, maybe 2019, we had a guest who. Specifically named it active deployment. I'm pretty sure. So it's funny that we're still having this conversation, even though I feel like the ecosystem is getting better and better, there's more and more services to deploy your app.</p><p>Like hatch box, fly render. I mean, you can keep going and going and going and going. So I don't feel like deployments getting harder. I feel like developers are complicating their setups more than they need to. And I feel like that's part of the problem. </p><p>[00:38:45] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> Also, my dig at Docker was a joke. I don't love it. I use it every.</p><p>Because of some of the complicated infrastructure stuff. So </p><p>[00:38:53] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> Chris Oliver, any thoughts there, it's </p><p>[00:38:55] <strong>Chris Oliver:</strong> one of those things where, as a developer, you don't want to have to worry about the operation sides of things. You know, if you could get away without Docker and just have everything running and you have your dependencies and all that, that would be awesome.</p><p>But yeah. At some point somebody's going, gonna kind of come up with a, an alternative to Docker that can probably mimic that a bit better. They're still solving a lot of problems on Docker itself. And I think eventually we'll see it, it probably won't come out of the rails ecosystem itself. It's kind of more of a DevOpsy area to work in.</p><p>And so I feel like we're oftentimes just consumers of that activity that's going on instead of. Creating those things ourselves and the community. So part of me just feels like, you know, waiting for changes to happen and stuff like that. </p><p>[00:39:46] <strong>Andrew Culver:</strong> One thing I want to point out, it's not directly related to what you're saying, but I think it's really exciting.</p><p>And Chris didn't mention it because it isn't directly related. But I think when you look at hatch box, how many infrastructure companies can you think of all of those companies that are doing interesting infrastructure, things that are boots. The only ones I can think of are layer of L forge and you've got hatch box and that baby was grown in the rails ecosystem.</p><p>And I don't think he's done yet. So I think there are exciting things happening in infrastructure, and I think that they can happen in the rails ecosystem. And I think that can be a call to action to anybody that's listening to this. So </p><p>[00:40:26] <strong>Jemma Issroff:</strong> we have very many calls to action and that's a full cap. I just want to say thank you so much to all of our listeners, always, and especially the ones who are present today, watching this panel and thank you to everyone on the panel for being a part of it. .</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Fruit Gushers, Fruit Roll-Ups, Fruit By the Foot, breadsticks with cheese dip, and DunkAroos? The guys are bringing back the 90’s talking about things they used to (and secretly still love) to eat! Then things get really serious as the conversation takes a massive turn on the topic of mental issues caused by perfectionism and writing code. This has never been discussed on this podcast, so the guys decided it was time to share their own struggles.  You may even be able to relate to some of the things the guys talk about and you may say to yourself, this is me!  Although the guys are not professionals, they just wanted to be honest and real and shed some light on this since many people don’t like to talk about their struggles. After listening to this episode, it may help knowing that you are not alone. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more!

      <itunes:summary>So, what’s “sup” with the guys this week? Jason and Andrew just can’t make themselves cry like actors do, but when Andrew was interviewing with Podia he sobbed when he found out the templating language they were using.  Which brings us to our guest, Sebastien Auriault, who is very special to us and also won’t make us cry.  Sebastien is a Ruby on Rails Developer at Podia and has been working on a project there with Jason and Andrew. We brought Sebastien on so he can talk about his developer origin story, which will be beneficial for those of you who are looking to get jobs who are in junior positions right now. Sebastien shares all kinds of advice and helpful information if you’re looking for a job and don’t know where to start. Also, if you leave a review on iTunes, DM Jason and the guys will personally thank you on the next episode.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to Remote Ruby and thanks for joining us!  Are you still listening? After last week’s episode, Jason doesn’t know if they lost every listener or we all just had a good time together, and he’s not sure there was even an in-between!  Jason said it was so intense that at one point he didn’t know if he should just stop Andrew, but instead he had a real Frozen moment and just “Let it Go!” On today’s episode, Chris is back, and we have a return guest that brings so much fun energy to our lives and that is Jared White, Writer, Designer, Ruby Developer, and builder of Bridgetown. Today, we’ll be discussing all things Bridgetown v1 that’s coming out and it sounds quite fascinating. Jared tells us more about how he used Roda, which is a Ruby based web framework, and then he shares his journey of what it’s been like for Bridgetown now and what he sees happening in the future for Bridgetown.  Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more! </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Jason and Andrew are in the house today, and instead of Remote Ruby they’re doing Remote Twitter. They’re going to talk about all different topics that people have requested on Twitter.  The guys are super excited to dive into this especially since some of the things they may not know anything about, but they’re going to attempt every single thing that was sent to them. You won’t want to miss Jason as he busts out his theatrical skills with a dramatic reading of Haml(et), we hear a little bit of singing of “Tomorrow” from the musical Annie, and the story behind why Jason bought Andrew lobster.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Jason and Chris have ice, snow, and freezing temps where they live, and Andrew is complaining about being cold at 60 degrees in Arizona! Maybe he’ll warm up when he starts his new job at Podia with Jason this week.  Also, if you enjoy Flipper like the guys do, then you’re in for a treat with our guest.  Today, joining us is John Nunemaker, builder of Flipper, which is feature flags for Ruby, as well as the programmer and owner of Box Out Sports, which is a content management system for social media graphics. John goes in depth about Flipper, Box Out Sports, some Flipper rules stuff he’s working on, and the Ruby gem he recently wrote called “brow.”  And hopefully you’re not too “short on time” because John tells us more about the fascinating watch app he’s building and shares stories of the history behind some of the cool watches he’s found. Go ahead and download this episode now to learn more!</itunes:summary>

But before the banter begins, Andrew announces after two years he’s finally shipped his website that you have to check out!  Also, today joining us as our guest is Benjamin Wood, who is a Software Developer and owns a software consulting company called Hint that he co-founded.  He’s been doing things with Docker for several years which we learn more about, and he’ll explain more on the new service that GitHub created called Codespaces, which is heavily Docker based.  Some other discussions the guys have revolve around the state of VSCode in Ruby Extension, Vim, and the ongoing conversation that keeps coming up about the VSCode app on the iPad.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Jason either has a gout flare up or carpal tunnel, so he’s contemplating if he should get an ergonomic keyboard and an ergonomic mouse since one of them is the culprit of his pain. What should this boomer do? For now, we’ll just have to wait to see what happens and get into chatting with our guest.  Today, we have joining us Andreas Eriksson, who is an Elixir Consultant for Erlang Solutions. We brought him on so we can chat about Elixir, Phoenix LiveView, and other things, since we’ve all been fascinated with wanting to learn more about this stuff.  We also find out about Andreas experience going from Ruby to Elixir, and what attracted him to the Elixir language after writing Ruby code for more than ten years.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to Remote Ruby and thanks for joining us!  We are LIVE from Denver at RubyConf 2021 with a big podcast crossover episode. Today, we have Jemma Issroff who is one of the co-hosts of the Ruby on Rails podcast and is moderating this panel.  We have three other podcasts represented here across five panelists from Remote Ruby Podcast, The Code with Jason Podcast, and The Ruby on Rails Podcast. Joining us from those podcasts are Andrew Mason, Jason Charnes, Emily Giurleo, Nick Schwaderer, and Jason Swett. Today, we have discussions about the RubyConf talks, which ones everyone is most excited to go to, and what is so special about the Ruby community to each panelist.  Then the conversation shifts to finding out why they like to come to these conferences, why they like to do podcasts, which podcasts they are most proud of putting out, thoughts on the diversity of people they bring on their podcasts, and stories about why everyone loves Brittany Martin!  There are some questions from the live audience such as how they come up with interesting content for their podcasts, who their “Ruby Heroes” are, and how they avoid burnout from consistently producing episodes. This is a must listen to episode, so go ahead and download it now! </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>We get an update about Jason’s power outage that happened last week, Chris tell us about an exciting point his house is at right now, and Jason has a billion dollar business idea for Chris that has to do with Pringles and shingles, and sadly Andrew puts that idea in the “gutter.” So pop open a can of Pringles or hit the Taco Bell drive-thru because the boys are about to take a deep dive into callbacks, some gems called Miss Hannigan, Wisper, and Noticed, and find out more about Parcel and Rails Event Store. Also, the guys share stories about JQuery and what’s going on with Rails 7.</itunes:summary>

However, Chris and Andrew are in the house and we are super excited to have three guests with us. Today, we have joining us from Polywork, Joe Ferrairo, Chris Polk, and Dylan Ginsburg. Joe is  Engineering Lead, Chris is VP of Engineering, and Dylan is Lead iOS Engineer. They are here to talk more about Polywork and all the cool stuff they are doing to make it happen on the iOS side. We find out things that make a good Rails Developer and what type of person would be best to join the Polywork team.

On today’s episode, we find out more about Jason’s interesting project he’s working on with a Mockup Generator and how MiniMagick has been working very well for him doing the commands, but he’s looked into using Cloudinary as well. We also get a little lesson on the magic behind ImageMagick, and hear more about the Rails 7 upgrade, Turbolinks, and Turbo. The conversation takes the back roads to the end of the episode talking about Mailchimp being sold to Intuit, hope that MicroConf happens next year, and how Reddit plays a role in why Jason thinks he lives in St. Louis, even though he actually lives in Memphis. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Today, it’s just the three of us, we’re going to make it and we’re going to try, especially since Andrew needs his meds refilled and can’t seem to get them since he’s moved to Phoenix. But hey, we’re going to get Andrew’s mind off of that and talk about how it was a big week for JavaScript in Rails.  Jason starts us out by explaining a JavaScript tool he’s been building, using Vite, a problem he had, and a solution he found. Then, the guys chat more about esbuild for Rails, Tailwind CSS Rails gem, Importmap for Rails, and Sass being removed from Rails 7.  If you’re in the mood for some good ol’ laughs today, this is the episode to listen to! Also, find out why Andrew said, “Once you get it working it works!” ☺</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>ason and Chris chat about what was going on in their world with Jason having issues with specs, and it’s all around Stripe, and Chris was in a similar boat with his PR for Pay. This week’s guest is Kasper Timm Hansen from the Rails Core Team.  Today, he’s going to tell us what he’s doing and how he got into doing Ruby and Rails. Kasper’s been doing some pull requests reviews and other things on Twitter and we find out other things he’s been up to. He talks about feature flags, shaping things, and one of the things he likes to do in terms of modeling things in a Rails app. We also learn why Kasper enjoys Ruby more than Python, his focus on the naming of things, which is more problem sizing and not so much about problem solving, and how he feels open source has changed in the last five years. Also, Chris shares a story when he was in college and had a very clear moment knowing he was going to do Rails forever. </itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:01:42] Last week the guys discussed using Inertia, and Jason tell us he’s been doing more Inertia and messing with forms, “axios” is explained, and using validation. </p><p> </p><p>[00:10:18] Jason talks about showing  some people what he’s been doing with Inertia and someone asked him how he was going to handle flash. Jason tells us what he did, and Andrew shares some thoughts on this.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:12:27] At Podia, Jason said they have a MutationObserver and what it does. Andrew tells us about the Shop Talk Show Podcast- Episode 471, where Dave Rupert talked about how a MutationObserver can lead to a memory leak.   </p><p><br></p><p>[00:14:45] We find out that Jason decided to bite the bullet and keep going with Inertia on an app, wanting to use Tailwind UI and all that, what Webpacker 5 has, what it does, and Andrew explains why they had to add that.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:20:24] Jason tells us about how Webpacker 6 seems less in your face, like verbose as Webpacker 5, and he asks Andrew if that makes sense and if he’s wrong about that. Andrew explains that they took away a lot of the magic, and the magic is what made it work out of the box for an average use case, and it’s really easy to understand now.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:25:20] Jason pulls up the docs, he sees react is supported, you need to add relevant packages, so he added Babel preset react, but it didn’t configure anything. He asks Andrew if Babel just knows and Andrew helps him out. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:28:37] Jason brings up Webpacker and mentions Andrew’s “7 Part Series” on Webpacker 6, and he asks him some questions about it.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:31:32] Andrew informs us that RubyGems has a Guides tab and he explains what it does.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>[00:34:18] Andrew talks about a Tweet he got regarding a repo he made back in 2018, which had Rails 6, React, Webpacker, and Tailwind. Also, he highly recommends reading through some of the Webpack docs to help you understand Webpack since it can be super frustrating. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:43:20] Andrew has a really serious and bold statement he makes that he just had to get out of his system! ☺</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Jason Charnes</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://rubyradar.mailchimpsites.com/">Ruby Radar</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/therubyradar">Ruby Radar Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/471/">Shop Talk Show Podcast-Episode 471-Perf as a job, Riverside vs Streamyard, Frontend Being Consumed, and How Much to Bill Clients</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/482">MutationObserver opportunity for memory leak #482-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode#enabling-jit-mode">Tailwindcss-Enabling JIT mode</a></p><p><a href="https://dev.to/andrewmcodes/webpacker-6-upgrade-guide-3p6d">Webpacker 6: Upgrade Guide-Andrew Mason</a> </p><p><a href="https://github.com/rails/webpacker">Webpacker-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/rails/webpacker#react">Webpacker React-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/">RubyGems Guides</a></p><p><a href="http://spizzicorestaurant.com/pizza-debate/">To Pineapple or To Not: A Pizza Debate (Spizzico Italian Kitchen)</a></p>]]>

Also, he highly recommends reading through some of the Webpack docs to help you understand Webpack since it can be super frustrating. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:43:20] Andrew has a really serious and bold statement he makes that he just had to get out of his system! ☺</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Jason Charnes</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://rubyradar.mailchimpsites.com/">Ruby Radar</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/therubyradar">Ruby Radar Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/471/">Shop Talk Show Podcast-Episode 471-Perf as a job, Riverside vs Streamyard, Frontend Being Consumed, and How Much to Bill Clients</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/482">MutationObserver opportunity for memory leak #482-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode#enabling-jit-mode">Tailwindcss-Enabling JIT mode</a></p><p><a href="https://dev.to/andrewmcodes/webpacker-6-upgrade-guide-3p6d">Webpacker 6: Upgrade Guide-Andrew Mason</a> </p><p><a href="https://github.com/rails/webpacker">Webpacker-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/rails/webpacker#react">Webpacker React-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/">RubyGems Guides</a></p><p><a href="http://spizzicorestaurant.com/pizza-debate/">To Pineapple or To Not: A Pizza Debate (Spizzico Italian Kitchen)</a></p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Chris is still on vacation, but the good news is, Jason and Andrew are not! They are here today with so much to talk about. Jason has been doing more Inertia and he tells us what he’s been doing with it, and Andrew has some things to share about it. We learn about using axios, validation, and MutationObserver. The conversations then take a turn to Webpacker.  Andrew explains how it’s easier to understand, now that they took a lot of the “magic” away and why he highly recommends reading through the Webpack docs since it can be super frustrating.  They talk about using Babel and more about the “Guides” tab in RubyGems. Also, Andrew had to get something out of his system and makes a really serious and bold statement! ☺</itunes:summary>

He was recently talking about it on an episode of<br>“Startups For the Rest of Us.”</p><p>[00:02:21] The guys talk about feeling burnt out, Chris going on vacation in two weeks,<br>Andrew needing a massage or float therapy, and good books to read.</p><p>[00:08:48] Andrew tells us he is slowly working his way through meta programming<br>Ruby and starting to read how to take smarter notes.</p><p>[00:11:12] The topic here is about taking good notes. Learn about a cool app that<br>Andrew likes to use for quick capture called Draft. He also tells us about his Obsidian<br>database you can check out on notes.andrewm.codes. Chris tells us about writing blog<br>posts and using Notational Velocity that stores and retrieves notes.</p><p>[00:23:10] Andrew and Chris talk about integrations being the key to the game,<br>especially as no code gets more popular, and coming up with product ideas using no-<br>code apps, and they mention using Zapier, IFTTT, and Automate.</p><p>[00:26:28] Chris tells us one of his long-term goals for Jumpstart which has to do with<br>having the ability to send and receive web hooks with Zapier. He mentions to hit him up<br>if you are using Jumpstart Pro and want to integrate with Zapier.</p><p>[00:29:12] Andrew asks Chris if he saw the Tweet from Patrick Collison from Stripe<br>about 170% faster Ruby.</p><p>[00:35:38] Chris dates himself and has stories to tell that start off with flash drives being<br>popular and a portable apps community he was into. Andrew tells us he somehow<br>figured out the WIFI password every year in high school and got caught.

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to Remote Ruby and thanks for joining us! We start off with the guys talking
about taking time off, vacations, getting a massage, float therapy, and good books to
read. We also learn about taking smarter notes and different apps that you can use to
help you with that such as Drafts and Notational Velocity. Also, the guys explain more
about using Obsidian, which Andrew is a big user of, using Zapier, and integrations
being the key to the game as no code gets more popular. We end with Chris and
Andrew going nostalgic on us, going back to their high school days sharing unbelievable
hacking stories and exposing themselves as 10X black hats! Download this episode
now to hear these stories and much more!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Today, Jason and Chris are here since Andrew is on his cross country move to Phoenix, and let’s just say Andrew certainly had a crazy week before he left.  We do have a guest with us today, Jason Swett, who is a developer, speaker, author, host of “The Rails with Jason” podcast, and known for his writings online about Rails testing.  Jason tells us what he does, explains service objects, why he thinks they are so popular, and why he would recommend to somebody writing pure Ruby. Chris talks about the Name of Person gem and what it does.  We also find out about Jason’s new book, The Complete Guide to Rails Testing, that he recently released and a discount code for Remote Ruby listeners!  And if the testing stuff sounds interesting, Jason tells us where you can go to get a little guide to help get you started.</itunes:summary>

We learn what ViewComponents are, how Joel came up with the idea, and his latest experiment and vision for it, which is a big one. Joel tells us some ideas he has for Cuprite, and Andrew talks about how Percy is a nice tool to use.

Andrew fills us in about a virtual talk at a meetup he’s giving in June, which he will be advocating for junior dev’s since it’s so important to him. Other topics discussed are Turbo, putting Turbo into React Native, using Turbo to build a PWA, htmx, how awesome TypeScript is, and the importance of writing better Ruby. Also, who knew there were different versions of JSON?</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>On today’s episode, the guys start off telling us how they all had a very rough, eventful week that let’s just say, involved an architect, the police, and repos and data lost. Then, they dive right into Jason telling us how he completed his testing videos for his StimulusReflex course but has hit a weird spot with the app being a little incomplete. Chris talks about the OmniAuth 2.0 course being out now and how he saved and resurrected madmin. We also learn about the 12 in 12 project that was released this week, Andrew trying to clean up projects, tying up loose ends, and how his GitHub is a mess. Will Andrew delete his GitHub? Will Andrew still be a programmer? Will Andrew’s sanity stay intact?  Find out next week, same time, same podcast.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:00:41] Chris and Jason tell us what they’ve been working on with Hotwire and StimulusReflex. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:03:19] Tobias tells us all about himself and what he does at Makandra.    </p><p> </p><p>[00:05:04] Tobias explains to us the idea behind Rails LTS, why it was created, and what it does for people.

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:00:48] The guys catch up on what’s been going on this week. Chris tells us he’s been using Jumpstart in rebuilding Hatchbox this week. Andrew has been on PTO all week, so he’s been chilling, cleaning, and in the middle of refactoring. Jason tells us about a call he got from someone who had signed up for HopeGrid.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:07:22] Jonas tells us about himself and what Matestack is.</p><p> </p><p>[00:10:38] Find out how Matestack is different from View Component or a traditional kind of component type gem. </p><p> </p><p>[00:12:34] Jonas explains what the Component UI’s written in Ruby look like.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:15:09] Chris asks Jonas if the responses are rendered in the JavaScript or is it actually making an Ajax request to render. Jonas explains two of the three layers of Matestack.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:19:55] Andrew asks if Vue.js is required to use Matestack or if it’s an option.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:23:15] Andrew makes a point to say that the docs are pretty comprehensive and Jonas has a really nice marketing site and it looks like he is trying to monetize this in a way he hasn’t seen a lot of people monetize open source before so he talks about it.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:28:33] Jonas tells us why someone should use Matestack and all about testing.</p><p>[00:37:22] Chris asks Jonas if he has a roadmap of things that he would like to have done that people can poke around through to see if they can find something to contribute and get involved.

      <itunes:summary>Chris and Andrew are here today! Chris starts off talking about going down the rabbit hole with their discussion last week about the Rails engines doc for Webpacker, and he finds out it is rough. We find out a problem Chris ran into with JavaScript and CSS to display graphs, installing Action Active Mailbox and a cool feature of Rails, which is ActiveModel. The discussion takes a turn into “Remote Ruby Therapy” for Andrew since he realizes this week that he is completely burned out and he’s taking a week off for self-care.  He talks about “burnout,” using an app called “Blinkist” that has been helpful, and the six things he wants to do make his life better, which includes to get some “good smelly stuff!”</itunes:summary>

Andrew talks about wanting to upgrade a Rails App and how he came across Ernesto’s FastRuby that had great content, which is why he asked him to be on the show today. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:12:39] We learn about FastRuby.io from Ernesto. He also talks about the kinds of things you need to think about before you upgrade Rails and what to do if your Test Suite isn’t that great. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:17:51] Ernesto tells us his dream gem.  Chris talks about a Chrome extension that would help write system tests based on what you wrote in the browser, and Andrew mentions the name of that gem which is “Heaven’s Door.”</p><p> </p><p>[00:21:08] We learn besides having a good Test Suite, the next thing you need before upgrading Rails is to have a continuous integration working, and Ernesto explains this.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:22:21] Andrew talks about Dual Booting Rails and he’s interested in it but needs to explore it more because it sounds complicated. He asks Ernesto to explain some common issues he runs across. </p><p>[00:24:12] Chris wonders if Ernesto encourages people, once they get up to Rails 6, to continue Dual Booting against Rails Master.  Ernesto talks about an article they have that talks about how to stay up to date so that this painful Rails upgrade process doesn’t happen again. Andrew gives advice to strongly version your gems in your gem file which he promises will make your life easier! ☺</p><p>[00:27:18] Jason is interested in the idea of running a build against a master Rails and he’s curious how to temper that. Chris talks about fiddling with the Appraisal Gem.</p><p>[00:30:51] Ernesto talks about how he recently started maintaining a gem called RubyCritic, and he explains what it does. </p><p>[00:34:09] Chris asks Ernesto how much he sees Ruby related things needing to be fixed when you’re upgrading apps versus gems and rails configuration things. He mentions Rails LTS, which is long time support for Rails.</p><p>[00:36:59] Ernesto tells us a new service they are working on called, State Updated Service, which is a Rails service to keep your application up to date. </p><p>[00:41:59] Ernesto gives a list of resources that people can look at to upgrade their Rails App.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Jason Charnes</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p>Chris Oliver</p><p><strong>Guest:</strong></p><p>Ernesto Tagwerker</p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/etagwerker?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ernesto Tagwerker Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/etagwerker">Ernesto Tagwerker GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ombulabs.com/">OmbuLabs</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OmbuLabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">OmbuLabs Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/fastrubyio">FastRuby.io Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJoF7sPVdM">Ernesto Tagwerker-Open Source: When Nights and Weekends Are Not Enough-Southeast Ruby 2017- YouTube</a></p><p><a href="https://www.fastruby.io/">Fast Ruby- The Complete Guide to Upgrade Rails e-book</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/amatsuda/heavens_door">Heaven’s Door</a></p><p><a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/upgrades/how-to-stay-up-to-date.html">How to Stay Up to date with Your Rails Application</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal">Appraisal-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic">RubyCritic-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://railslts.com/">Rails LTS</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/fastruby/next_rails">Ten Years of Rails Upgrades-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="http://railsdiff.org/">RailsDiff</a></p><p><a href="https://railsbump.org/">RailsBump</a><br><a href="https://www.fastruby.io/stay-up-to-date">Fast Ruby - Stay Up To Date</a></p><p><br>If you'd like to sponsor future episodes, please email chris@gorails.com</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:00:25] What have the guys been up to? Jason tells us he’s been working on his editor project with Reflex and Cable Ready, Chris has been working on Stimulus Reflex, and Andrew’s project is trying to truncate a table that has 225 million records in it! Yikes! Fingers crossed for Andrew! </p><p><br></p><p>[00:07:20] Will tells us all about himself and how he got into Rails. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:09:02] Will gives us a synopsis of his E-book, <em>Break </em>Into<em> Tech With Twitter, </em>that was released a few weeks ago. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:10:21] Andrew asks Will, as a newer developer, what it’s like transitioning from JavaScript into Ruby on Rails.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:12:40] Chris wonders if going from JavaScript with all the call backs into Ruby if it was hard for Will to wrap his head around the way the language operates differently.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:15:12] Jason asks Will if his experience with JavaScript was front end or backend.

Let’s just say Andrew gives 1 A choice and 3 B choices. ☺ Jason and Chris explain what they do, and Andrew voices his opinion as well.  </p><p>[00:40:00] Andrew tells Jason he needs to teach him how to come to terms with this issue and it will probably be like a karate kid kind of montage. ☺</p><p>[00:40:29] Andrew talks about Rails Best Practices, Flog, and Flay, and wonders when do you decide if I need to keep this dependency because it will provide value if I use it, or this is not providing me value and I should just get rid of it.   </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Jason Charnes</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p>Chris<strong> </strong>Oliver</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://courses.gorails.com/advanced-ruby-for-rails-devs">Advanced Ruby: Behind The Magic Course</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiqqC_fbP1c">“My Life is potato”- YouTube</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/hopsoft/stimulus_reflex/pull/309">Stimulus Reflex Print warning and exit if caching is disabled or npm/gem versions are mismatched #309-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/">Yarn Link</a></p><p><a href="https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/rubocoping-with-legacy-bring-your-ruby-code-up-to-standard">RuboCoping with legacy</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/.git-blame-ignore-revs">Discourse-ignore coding standards applied to plugins-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/usage/auto_correct.html#safe-auto-correct">RuboCop- Safe auto-correct</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/flyerhzm/rails_best_practices">Rails best practices-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/flog">Flog-GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://news.vuejs.org/">Vue.js v3.0.0</a> </p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>On today’s episode, Jason, Chris, and Andrew are trying to keep each other in balance.  Chris starts off by talking about using yarn link to help with an issue that came up. The guys also talk about Vue.js 3.0.0 just being released and Jason being on bug rotation this week at work and dealing with technical debt.  There is a chat about Rails best practices, Flog, and Flay, and whether or not it will provide value.  Andrew brings up a question about using RuboCop and installing it on legacy base, and realizes he needs Jason to teach him how to come to terms with this issue and it will probably be like a karate kid moment.  The question stands:  Will Andrew move to a farm or become the next Karate Kid? </itunes:summary>

Chris brings up his first Rails job out of college. </p><p>[00:15:28] Andrew tells us what his mentor taught him early in his career about having no idea about the circumstances or requirements surrounding the way certain things are done. He shares some great advice here. </p><p>[00:19:58] Chris talks about doing a few screencasts of downloading the earliest version of Rails he could find and trying to build something with it and then do Rails 2.3 or Rails 3.  Will he do it? Andrew is wondering if some of the assumptions he has about issues Chris is going to run into are going to be true or not. </p><p>[00:28:02] Andrew was trying to install a version of EventMachine, and he ran into an issue. He found a comment and got it to work. Listen to Andrew’s advice here as he stands on a soapbox. ☺</p><p>[00:33:56] Andrew talks about Dash, an API Documentation Browser, for macOS. </p><p>[00:39:36] Since Andrew is on this Rails 4 app, Chris wonders if he’s going to be upgrading it to Rails 5 and 6. </p><p>[00:42:38] Chris talks about his first job out of college and it was not the best experience.  Andrew talks about companies and having a problem where there is some code somewhere in your application or something works a certain way because one customer depends on it and having to live with that code to not make the customer mad.  </p><p>[00:51:12] We end the episode by Chris telling Andrew he has to go get tested for COVID since his sister has it. He has no symptoms, so he’s hopeful it will be negative.  </p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong><br>Chris Oliver<br>Andrew Mason</p><p><br><strong>Sponsor:</strong><br><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></p><p><br><strong>Links:</strong><br><a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash for macOS</a><br><a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine">EventMachine-GItHub</a></p>]]>

Jason also mentions that he’s been doing a lot of reflex and that they’ve expanded reflex down to four or five parts of their application. Chris wants to know if it’s still been working out without having to move to Anycable yet.</p><p>[00:33:00] Jason tells us his company, <a href="https://apply.workable.com/podia/j/6D4A20DE01/">Podia, is hiring if you’re interested or you want to solve all the problems he’s mentioned</a>, and Andrew has landed a new job and he tells us where.

They guys also talk about WebAuthn Gem, Two-factor Authentication, and Turbolinks.

In the last episode, COVID-19 was talked about, so the guys want to shift the focus to new and better things happening in the Gem world, like DHH’s Hey’s Gemfile and Basecamps Gemfile. Jason made an Avatar Component and how he uses formBuilder. They guys also talk about WebAuthn Gem, Two-factor Authentication, and Turbolinks. There are some newer Gems out there they discuss as well and some of their favorites. Jason brings back another question of the week to see if it will get answered.

Jason talks about using components at work. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:13:19] Chris wonders if Jason has dropped down into Cable Ready since he’s been using Stimulus Reflex a lot. Chris finds it far more effective than Stimulus Reflex for what he has to do. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:18:51] Jason brings up offline and using it with Trix and he feels like he’s having to break rules to get it to work with Trix.  Cursor positioning issues are talked about here. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:21:56] The guys chat about using halt so actions don’t re-render.

He wonders if you want to scroll back in history how do you keep track of it and render it? Andrew shares something with Chris he has in their code base that may help. </p><p>[00:37:35] Staying on the topic of Reflex, Jason mentions shipping out through Podia, a Stimulus Reflex testing library called, “Stimulus Reflex Testing” and he couldn’t find any test helpers or any testing story for reflex right now.  </p><p>[00:42:00] Jason mentions a problem he’s had with reflex creating a request, like a dummy request in order for it to re-render.

He explains what happens and what he tries to do to make it work out. </p><p>[00:46:47] Andrew explains why there is no amazing testing support in Reflex and he also has a few suggestions for Jason that he could try.  </p><p>[00:49:57] Andrew asks the guys if they’ve enabled the new design on GitHub yet and he tells them how to do it. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/development/ror/">Linode</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Jason Charnes</p><p>Chris Oliver</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/lifecycle#server-side-reflex-callbacks">Server-Side Reflex Callbacks</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/code_fund_ads/blob/410b23da766757a359fb846e7a10087cf3efa24c/app/javascript/src/turbolinks-persist-scroll.js#L27">Turbolinks persist scroll.js<strong>-</strong>GitHib</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/podia/stimulus_reflex_testing">Podia StimulusReflex testing-GitHib</a></p><p><a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html">Action Cable</a></p><p><a href="https://javascript.info/callbacks">JavaScript Callbacks</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/hopsoft/cable_ready">CableReady-GitHub</a></p>]]>

Andrew starts off talking about a Webpacker one called, “Webpacker, It-just-works, But How?’ by Justin Gordon. Also, “Tidy First?” by Kent Beck.  Matt mentions that DHH had an interesting one, which was more of a Q&amp;A, “Keynote Interview,” by David Heinemeier Hansson. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:10:50] Chris mentions everyone checking out DHH’s series on YouTube called, “Writing Software Well.” It convinced Chris to take a look at concerns more. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:17:10] Another great video from RailsConf 2020 that Andrew talks about is the Engines video by Vladimir Dementyev called, “Monoliths Between Microservices.”</p><p><br></p><p>[00:21:03] Matt liked a talk on “Bug Bounty” by Jason Meller, from Kolide which was a good mix of the UX and Dev side and evaluating security issues.  He also mentions something about “pseudo mode” you may be interested in. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:26:54] Andrew tells us three more talks he enjoyed: “Successfully Onboarding a Junior Engineer in Three Steps,” with Emily Giurleo, “Building a Performance Analytics Tool with Active Support,” with Christian Bruckmeyer, and “Encapsulating Views,” with Joel Hawksley.</p><p>[00:31:09] Andrew talks about not using validations and instead using a render method and Jason tells him that feature came out of Podia and explains. </p><p>[00:31:53] Jason brings up how they have an entire thread of “Rails WTF's” that came about from some Tweets from Advi.  Andrew chimes in with a shout-out to Betsy Haibel, who’s doing an amazing job of being one of the moderators, asking questions and helping people clear up things. </p><p>[00:38:18] Chris brings up “Spring” and some of its frustrations.  </p><p>[00:41:28] Chris brings up the topic of GitHub’s “no search and rails guides” and he explains what happened here.

He says it’s nice to have Bridgetown and explains why. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:23:45] Jared talks about the core team working on Jekyll right now, GitHub has been pretty steady for a long time, but it’s just been a really slow release cycle to get things changed. His take on it is, you either give up or you step it up! ☺</p><p><br></p><p>[00:28:00] Jared brings up a new project called, Redwood.js, which is headed up by Tom Preston- Werner, who is the guy who invented Jekyll as well as GitHub.  Jason looks at the Redwood site and how it’s organized and has a few comments to add about it. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:37:30] Andrew talks about why Gatsby is so popular because of their theming. Also, Gatsby released something called, “Recipes” and he explains it. He asks Jared since Bridgetown is pre-1.0 is there is any danger to running it in production and he wonders if this is something he could put in his Rails App.  Jared answers these questions. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:40:55] Andrew tells us his dream use of Bridgetown here. Jared tells us something they are cooking up with the liquid template engine that Bridgestone uses. </p><p>[00:44:47] Chris asks Jared, since these are static sites, is this something where you might go and make the call of having turbo links on by default because it wouldn’t hurt anything, and you’d be able to get quicker page views? Jared mentions swup.js. and explains. </p><p>[00:50:46] Andrew gives us some advice on what you should use if you are maintaining a gem where there is a JavaScript package and a Ruby Gem.  He also mentions a gem post install command in Stimulus Reflex.</p><p>[00:55:05] If you want to support, have questions, or comments, Jared mentions going to community.bridgetownrb.com which is a forum you can get started on. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/development/ror/">Linode</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Jason Charnes</p><p>Chris Oliver</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Guest:</strong></p><p>Jared White</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jaredcwhite?lang=en">Jared White Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/jaredcwhite">Jared White GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://www.bridgetownrb.com/">Bridgetownrb.com</a></p><p><a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a></p><p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyllrb</a></p><p><a href="https://redwoodjs.com/">Redwoodjs</a></p><p><a href="http://www.fullstackradio.com/138">Full Stack Radio-Tom Preston-Werner</a></p><p><a href="https://swup.js.org/">Swupjs</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/hopsoft/stimulus_reflex/blob/465acceac7b7f8666a89e15065f67248b8901f16/stimulus_reflex.gemspec#L11">Stimulus Reflex Gem Specification GitHub</a></p><p><a href="https://dev.to/andrewmcodes/build-and-deploy-a-static-site-with-ruby-bridgetown-tailwindcss-and-netlify-3934">Dev.to-Build and deploy a static site with Ruby, Bridgetown, Tailwind CSS, and Netlify</a></p><p><a href="https://community.bridgetownrb.com/">Bridgetown Community</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/">Gatsby Recipes</a></p>]]>

Let’s say it’s been mentally stimulating and exciting for Jason working on this project. </p><p>[00:34:57] Another thing Jason worked on is he migrated “field help off action text” and he paired up with Andrew to do this.  Chris wants to hear all about this. </p><p>[00:39:56] Andrew has been working on components…a lot of components. He talks about using Chris’s calendar gem.</p><p>[00:46:47] Listen here to find out why Andrew is now Team ERB ☺. </p><p>[00:52:35] The guys discuss their choice of password apps.  Andrew uses Google Authenticator, Chris uses Authy, and Jason uses 1Password.   </p><p><br></p><p>[00:53:47] Jason mentions in Ruby Weekly today, GitHub is sponsoring, Matz, the creator of Ruby.

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:03:35] Chris talks about “Active Admin,” which is the most popular Rails Admin Gem and how useful it is to use.  </p><p><br></p><p>[00:07:25] Andrew brings up “Lucky,” a Crystal database wrapper, and Chris gives his opinion about it. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:11:47] Chris and Andrew mention using GitLab, but both prefer GitHub until things get fixed. And with teams going free mostly, it will be nice for discussions and paid projects like Jumpstart or Tailwind UI. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:14:28] Chris shares some exciting news about getting a new GitHub sponsor! Cha-Ching! Let’s just say it was the highlight of his week!! ☺</p><p><br></p><p>[00:19:26] Optimism, which is a Gem to do form type things, is mentioned here. Also, Chris brings up a question on if anyone has done this on Stimulus Reflex, where someone takes an action, but it would broadcast the update to everybody. Is this easily doable? Andrew answers this. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:24:03]] Andrew talks about using Typescript and Chris talks about wanting to explore into CableReady. There is also talk with a breaking change in Stimulus Reflex that just recently happened. </p><p>[00:29:49] Chris asks Andrew if he has a source repo where he keeps his GitHub pull request templates.</p><p>[00:32:50] In talking about docs, Andrew recommends “Read the Docs” and Chris uses “GitBook” for Hatchbox docs and they discuss in depth about it.   </p><p>[00:41:09] Chris talks about how we need a new way of people maintaining things to get stuff done, like a changing of the guards.  But he hopes there will still be good maintainers as things go on. Andrew has been thinking about that a lot too and he shares his thoughts. </p><p>[00:43:10] Chris explains a Lambda and a Proc and the difference between them.  </p><p>[00:49:46] Andrew asks Chris when he is passing parameters to a method, does he name them, or does he just pass them all in? Andrew explains. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:57:07] Andrew and Chris talk about using Binstubs and Annotate. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/development/ror/">Linode</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Chris Oliver</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://luckyframework.org/">Lucky</a></p><p><a href="http://expo.stimulusreflex.com/demos/chat">Stimulus Reflex Chat</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme">Awesome READMEs</a></p><p><a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">GitBook</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/code_fund_ads/pull/1217">Update gems and run annotate</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Understanding-binstubs">binstubs</a></p><p><a href="https://activeadmin.info/">ActiveAdmin</a></p><p><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/optimism/versions/3.3.1">Optimism</a> </p><p><a href="https://github.com/hopsoft/cable_ready">CableReady</a></p><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740046/whats-the-difference-between-a-proc-and-a-lambda-in-ruby">Lambda and Proc<br></a><br></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:03:35] Chris talks about “Active Admin,” which is the most popular Rails Admin Gem and how useful it is to use.  </p><p><br></p><p>[00:07:25] Andrew brings up “Lucky,” a Crystal database wrapper, and Chris gives his opinion about it. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:11:47] Chris and Andrew mention using GitLab, but both prefer GitHub until things get fixed. And with teams going free mostly, it will be nice for discussions and paid projects like Jumpstart or Tailwind UI. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:14:28] Chris shares some exciting news about getting a new GitHub sponsor! Cha-Ching! Let’s just say it was the highlight of his week!! ☺</p><p><br></p><p>[00:19:26] Optimism, which is a Gem to do form type things, is mentioned here. Also, Chris brings up a question on if anyone has done this on Stimulus Reflex, where someone takes an action, but it would broadcast the update to everybody. Is this easily doable? Andrew answers this. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:24:03]] Andrew talks about using Typescript and Chris talks about wanting to explore into CableReady. There is also talk with a breaking change in Stimulus Reflex that just recently happened. </p><p>[00:29:49] Chris asks Andrew if he has a source repo where he keeps his GitHub pull request templates.</p><p>[00:32:50] In talking about docs, Andrew recommends “Read the Docs” and Chris uses “GitBook” for Hatchbox docs and they discuss in depth about it.   </p><p>[00:41:09] Chris talks about how we need a new way of people maintaining things to get stuff done, like a changing of the guards.  But he hopes there will still be good maintainers as things go on. Andrew has been thinking about that a lot too and he shares his thoughts. </p><p>[00:43:10] Chris explains a Lambda and a Proc and the difference between them.  </p><p>[00:49:46] Andrew asks Chris when he is passing parameters to a method, does he name them, or does he just pass them all in? Andrew explains. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:57:07] Andrew and Chris talk about using Binstubs and Annotate. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/development/ror/">Linode</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Chris Oliver</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://luckyframework.org/">Lucky</a></p><p><a href="http://expo.stimulusreflex.com/demos/chat">Stimulus Reflex Chat</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme">Awesome READMEs</a></p><p><a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">GitBook</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/code_fund_ads/pull/1217">Update gems and run annotate</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Understanding-binstubs">binstubs</a></p><p><a href="https://activeadmin.info/">ActiveAdmin</a></p><p><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/optimism/versions/3.3.1">Optimism</a> </p><p><a href="https://github.com/hopsoft/cable_ready">CableReady</a></p><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740046/whats-the-difference-between-a-proc-and-a-lambda-in-ruby">Lambda and Proc<br></a><br></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:02:43] Steve gives his background, jobs he’s had, and what he’s currently doing now. He also talks about how he stumbled upon Rails and how it was exactly what he was looking for because it allowed him so many resources. He did snag his own domain which is nice. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:08:25] Chris chimes because he can relate to everything Steve has been talking about with agency work.  He also talks about something that taught him the most which was spending time cloning stuff that already existed. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:12:04] Steve asks the guys questions about task models and reminder models. Andrew mentions a video he should watch on database designs for beginners by David Copeland. Chris gives some advice on design patterns and talks about his first Rails job.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:18:54] Steve has questions about users note and if there should be a note limit column on the user’s table with a default value.  Chris gives his advice on this. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:24:06] Jason jumps in with answering Steve’s questions about migrations and manipulating data within that migration since he’s had positive and negative experiences doing data migrations. Chris also shares some information.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:31:33 Steve asks about the database being locked up and what would need to be done so Chris and Jason give his advice on what to do. Jason mentions a concept called, “Database Transactions.”</p><p>[00:37:21] Steve wonders how often he should be updating his Gems, if at all. He knows there are security releases for Gems and Rails but is he supposed to be doing this every day? Andrew and Chris give him some info on this. </p><p>[00:44:05] Steve asks about what Webpacker does and Chris explains it more in depth. Chris also talks about Turbo Links and JavaScript. </p><p>[00:50:04] Steve has “Career” questions he poses to the guys. He wants to know how they got their foot in the door and how they got their breakthrough. Also, he wants to know what their thoughts are on the job market. There are some very interesting stories and awesome advice given by the guys that is definitely worth listening to.</p><p>[01:05:18] Nate drops in and has a bit of advice for Steve by telling him to not beat himself up if he bombs a few interviews.  It’s just the culture of tech hiring now, which is not great. Basically, it just takes time. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/development/ror/">Linode</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p><p>Chris Oliver</p><p>Andrew Mason</p><p>Jason Charnes</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Guest Panelist:</strong></p><p>Nate Hopkins (jumps in at the end with his knowledge bombs!)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Guest:</strong></p><p>Steve Polito</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://stevepolito.design/">Steve Polito</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stevepolitodsgn?lang=en">Steve Polito Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://rails.fm/">Rails.fm</a></p><p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a></p><p><a href="https://www.simplesitestatus.com/">Simple Site Status</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VsSXRPEBo0">Database Design for Beginners-David Copeland</a> </p><p><a href="https://www.poodr.com/">Practical Object-Oriented Design</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations">GitHub Migrations</a></p><p>Active Record Transactions</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ilyakatz/data-migrate">GitHub Data Migrate</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to">GitHub Dev.to</a></p>]]>

There are lots of prizes and they are pretty good, but you need to do something to participate so find out here ☺ </p><p><br></p><p>[00:12:46] Andrew brings up how View Component from GitHub went through changing their Gem name and doing upgrades and how they have collection support now. Also, Andrew got Storybook running with the latest changes. Jason is curious how Andrew got Storybook wired up with it. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:18:29] Andrew gives a great description of what Storybook is in case you don’t know.   </p><p><br></p><p>[00:22:57] Andrew brings up something nice that got added to View Component which is integrating the View Component Previews into Rails Conductor.  </p><p><br></p><p>[00:25:18] Dave Paola is mentioned by Andrew, who has met him through Twitter and Chris has chatted with him over email, and he is working on a bootstrap component library implemented in Vue Component. </p><p>[00:26:48] The guys all have a discussion on bootstrapping, things that work and don’t work. Also, “themes” are touched on with JavaScript. </p><p>[00:31:58] Chris mentions Caleb Porzio, who created Alpine JS, he will be doing a series of videos, on Laracasts, about creating Alpine JS from scratch, which is pretty sweet.</p><p>[00:35:39] Andrew mentions some really good Tailwind UI extensions for VS Code that have IntelliSense which is amazing! </p><p>[00:38:15] Jason’s been working on some Action Text stuff. Find out what he’s been up to. Chris also has some things to add as well about Action Text.  He goes into two methods for rendering with videos on YouTube. </p><p>[00:49:34] Jason talks about feeling stuck sometimes and having to rewrite problems that have been solved for many years like putting a table in an editor. Chris has some ideas for him. </p><p>[00:57:05] Jason has a question about Active Storage and Chris answers this. </p><p>[1:01:12] Andrew mentions the date for Rails Talks coming out in May to replace the conference that was cancelled.

        <![CDATA[<p>[00:01:47] Chris talks about how with gas prices being so low and no one being on the road, the Cannonball Run (NY-LA car race) people are talking about how now would be a good time to run the race. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:03:41] With RailsConf 2020 getting cancelled. Chris was asked to record what was going to be his presentation for RailsConf…for what is now being dubbed as RailsConf 2020.2 “Couch Edition,” which brings some of RailsConf 2020 right to the comfort of your couch. Online viewing starts on May 5th. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:04:23] Jason launched the HopeGrid App for churches. He worked on it for a week. He talks about with a deadline looming how your priorities change. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:05:43] This reminds Chris of how annoying multi-tenancy stuff can be. He talks about the project he was working on. Dealing with things like how to enforce security on the multi-tenancy stuff and keeping customer data separate.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:11:44] Chris cites an example using GitHub’s account types and how he wanted something similar for Jumpstart. Now he needs to work on notifications, like how Laravel has built in. He likes how Slack, email, SMS and database notifications are all separate.   </p><p><br></p><p>[00:14:44] Jason, who uses Postmark for transactional emails, has been struggling with it a bit. He sends two types of emails, invitational and need. His needs ones are making it through just fine, but the only 50% of his invitational ones are making it through. How did he fix it? Sometimes it just takes a simple “bush” fix.    </p><p> </p><p>[00:18:25] Chris talks about how he wonders when Rails 6.1 will be released since RailsConf 2020 got cancelled. The guys talk about Stimulus, Turbolinks, and Webpacker 5.</p><p><br></p><p>[00:22:20] Chris goes into why versioning is tough. Issues like supporting Stripe payments from up to 10 different models. He discusses how he made changes to Jumpstart to support multiple billable models. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:28:24] If you heard last week’s episode, Nate walked us through StimulusReflex and Chris had some time to play around with it. Hear his thoughts. Tease: “It kinda feels like magic”. </p><p><br></p><p>[00:34:31] Chris talk about the sorting feature he was working on with Jason that he added to Jumpstart. He talks about how StimulusReflex would make sorting more like a data table. Possible future screencast example for Chris? </p><p><br></p><p>[00:39:36] Hatchbox FTW!

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, we chat with Jonathan Reinink. According to his website, Jonathan is active in the open-source community, particularly within the PHP and Laravel space. We'd argue Jonathan is also very active in the CSS and JS open-source community, as well. Jonathan co-authored TailwindCSS and authored Inertia.js. We talk with Jonathan about how he helped get TailwindCSS off the ground and dig deep into Inertia.js. Inertia.js lets you quickly build modern single-page React, Vue and Svelte apps using classic server-side routing and controllers.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Buckle up! In this episode, Javan Makhmali and Sam Stephenson join Jason and Chris. Sam and Javan are employees at Basecamp and also part of the mastermind behind many JavaScript libraries to come out of Basecamp: Turbolinks, Trix, and Stimulus. They each share how they got started programming, a brief insight into how they work at Basecamp, the transition from CoffeeScript to ES6, Typescript, as well as (wait for it...) upcoming features in Stimulus (🙌) and considerations for Turbolinks 6 (no feature promises made 😉).

It was an absolute joy to chat with Javan and Sam. We very much enjoyed this episode and hope you will enjoy it, too. </itunes:summary>

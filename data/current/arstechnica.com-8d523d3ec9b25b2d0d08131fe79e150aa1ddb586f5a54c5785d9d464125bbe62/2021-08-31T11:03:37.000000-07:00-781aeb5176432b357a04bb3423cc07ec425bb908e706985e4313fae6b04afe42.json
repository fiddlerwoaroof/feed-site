The reversion is the product of the Trump administration's haste to get rid of Obama-era regulations, leading to action that produced rules running counter to the Environmental Protection Agency's own scientific findings. As a result, a judge has decided that the rules cannot remain in place for the time that will be needed for the Biden administration to formulate replacements.</p>\n<h2>Defining water</h2>\n<p>The long-running saga is the product of the Clean Water Act's remarkably vague protections. The act seeks to control pollution via a permitting process that applies to the “waters of the United States,&quot; but it doesn't define what constitutes said waters.</p>\n<p>While the process would clearly apply to a flowing river, it's less clear whether the act would regulate the pollution of a stream bed only filled seasonally or following heavy rains—even though the stream bed can flow directly into a river that is active year-round. Similar issues apply to items like man-made ponds that connect to other bodies via groundwater flow.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790905#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790905&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

Cases of influenza-like illnesses are off to a startlingly strong and early start this season. RSV—respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus—continues to skyrocket. A stew of SARS-CoV-2 variants is still simmering in the background. And the rabble of usual cold-season viruses, such as rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, is also making the rounds.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSV.jpg\"><img alt=\"RSV national trends.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSV-640x290.jpg\"></a><p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSV.jpg\" class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSV national trends.</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">CDC</a>)</p></div>\n<p>With the surge in infections, children's hospitals around the country have reported being at capacity or overwhelmed, as Ars has reported before. But another effect of the crush of viruses is a squeeze on the workforce. As <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/11/15/work-absences-childcare/\">The Washington Post first reported Tuesday</a>, the US broke its record last month for people missing work due to childcare problems—such as having children home sick and childcare facilities or schools shuttered due to staffing shortages and sickness.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/outpatient-visits.jpg\"><img alt=\"Outpatient respiratory illness visits.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/outpatient-visits-640x450.jpg\"></a><p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/outpatient-visits.jpg\" class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outpatient respiratory illness visits.</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm\">CDC</a>)</p></div>\n<p>In October, more than 100,000 employed Americans missed work for childcare-related problems, <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02096055\">according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. That is more missing workers than in any other month in recent records, including the entirety of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many childcare facilities and schools closed down for extended periods. At the height of pandemic-related shutdowns in 2020, the number of Americans missing work for childcare problems only reached the low 90,000s.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898421#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898421&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

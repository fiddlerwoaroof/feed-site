Layoffs began yesterday in the Amazon hardware <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services\">division</a> that makes products including Echo, Alexa, Fire, and Kindle devices.</p>\n<p>&quot;We notified impacted employees yesterday, and will continue to work closely with each individual to provide support, including assisting in finding new roles,&quot; Amazon Senior VP of Devices &amp; Services Dave Limp wrote to his department's staff today in a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/a-team-update-from-dave-limp\">memo posted publicly by Amazon</a>.

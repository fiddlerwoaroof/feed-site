Now the telescope is giving astronomers clues about the formation of a new star, with a <a href=\"https://esawebb.org/news/weic2219/?lang\">stunning image</a> of an hourglass-shaped dark cloud surrounding a protostar, an object known as L1527.</p>\n<p>As we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/stunning-new-webb-telescope-image-showcases-the-pillars-of-creation/\">reported previously</a>, the James Webb Space Telescope launched in December 2021 and, after a suspenseful sunshield and mirror deployment <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/nasa-completes-most-challenging-part-of-the-webb-telescopes-deployment/\">over several months</a>, began capturing stunning images. First, there was the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/webbs-first-light-reveals-a-plethora-of-galaxies-in-a-tiny-patch-of-sky/\">deep field image</a> of the Universe, released in July. This was followed by images of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/the-other-firsts-the-rest-of-the-first-five-webb-telescope-images/\">exoplanet atmospheres</a>, the Southern Ring Nebula, a cluster of interacting galaxies called Stephan's Quintet, and the Carina Nebula, a star-forming region about 7,600 light-years away.</p>\n<p>In August, we received <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/new-webb-images-of-jupiter-show-dazzling-auroras-and-two-small-moons/\">gorgeous images</a> of Jupiter, including the auroras at both poles that result from Jupiter's powerful magnetic field, as well as its thin rings and two of the gas giant's small moons. This was followed a month later by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/astounding-new-webb-image-reveals-tens-of-thousands-of-young-stars/\">a mosaic image</a> showing a panorama of star formation stretching across a staggering 340 light-years in the Tarantula Nebula—so named because of its long, dusty filaments. We also were treated to spectacular images of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/webb-telescope-captures-dazzling-views-of-neptune-and-its-moons/\">Neptune and its rings</a>, which have not been directly observed since Voyager 2 flew by the planet in 1989, and, as already mentioned, the Pillars of Creation.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898238#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898238&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

This kind of access differs from the carefully selected &quot;slices&quot; we sometimes play in preview events, as those are meant to show an unfinished game in its best light.</p>\n<p>But after going hands-on with <em>Far Cry 6</em> for nearly four hours, I was reminded why game studios are sometimes cagey about prerelease reveals.</p>\n<p>The demo I played was equal parts massive and unwieldy. I couldn't help but feel like hundreds of Ubisoft staffers' efforts to create a beautiful and convincing pseudo-Cuban adventure wound up squeezed into a single, tiny clown car of a package. The issues didn't end with game-breaking bugs and wonky AI, which may very well be resolved on, erm, October 7. At this point, I'm more concerned about uninspiring new loadout systems, a narrative tone that can't make up its mind, and an absolute yawn of a return to the Ubisoft open-world bloat of old.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790742#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790742&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

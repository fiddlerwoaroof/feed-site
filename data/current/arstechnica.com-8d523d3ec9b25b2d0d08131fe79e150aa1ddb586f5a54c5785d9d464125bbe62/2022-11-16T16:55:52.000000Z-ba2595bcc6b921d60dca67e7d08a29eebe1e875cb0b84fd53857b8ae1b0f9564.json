With the new iteration, players can remap inputs and save them as custom profiles and even replace physical buttons and add levers to the controller’s backside.</p>\n<p>Though these changes offer a certain level of accessibility, neither the announcement nor the <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/23/introducing-the-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-the-ultra-customizable-controller-for-playstation-5/\">accompanying blog post</a> suggests this was deliberate.

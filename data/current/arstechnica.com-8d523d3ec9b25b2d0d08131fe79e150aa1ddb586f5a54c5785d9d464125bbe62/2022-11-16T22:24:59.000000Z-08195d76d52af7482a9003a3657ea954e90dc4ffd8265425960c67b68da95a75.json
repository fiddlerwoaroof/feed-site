It will reportedly use tens of thousands of high-end Nvidia GPUs for applications like deep learning and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/twitter-pranksters-derail-gpt-3-bot-with-newly-discovered-prompt-injection-hack/\">large language models</a>. The companies aim to make it one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world.</p>\n\n<p>In turn, the new supercomputer will feature thousands of units of what is arguably the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/nvidias-flagship-ai-chip-reportedly-4-5x-faster-than-the-previous-champ/\">most powerful GPU</a> in the world, the Hopper H100, which Nvidia <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/hopper-time-nvidias-most-powerful-ai-chip-yet-ships-in-october/\">launched</a> in October. Nvidia will also provide its second most powerful GPU, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/nvidia-ditches-intel-cozies-up-to-amd-with-its-new-dgx-a100/\">A100</a>, and utilize its <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/infiniband/\">Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> networking platform, which can transfer data at 400 gigabits per second between servers, linking them together into a powerful cluster.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft will contribute its Azure cloud infrastructure and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nd-series\">ND-</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nc-series\">NC-series</a> virtual machines. Nvidia's <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/\">AI Enterprise platform</a> will tie the whole thing together. The companies will also collaborate on <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/\">DeepSpeed</a>, Microsoft's deep learning optimization software.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898351#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898351&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

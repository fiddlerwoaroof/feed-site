Like Thunderbolt 3 and 4, a fully enabled USB 4 port supports data-transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps and PCIe tunneling for support of external GPUs and other high-speed accessories. Some USB 4 ports only support the spec's minimum speed of 20Gbps, the same speed as USB 3.2 Gen 2, but Razer's ports do appear to be fully enabled 40Gbps ports.</p>\n<p>Razer isn't doing anything particularly special to boost its USB speeds. Rather, it's taking advantage of the USB 4 capabilities that are built into all Ryzen 6000 processors. As long as a laptop's manufacturer included the hardware necessary to support USB 4 speeds, any manufacturer can &quot;upgrade&quot; to USB 4 via a firmware update and a chipset driver that <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-usb4-chipset-driver-update-for-ryzen-6000\">AMD released over the summer</a>. PCWorld tested Ryzen 6000's USB 4 support <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/703578/usb4-support-amd-ryzen-6000-laptop.html\">on an Asus ZenBook</a> that also required a BIOS update before it supported the feature.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898209#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898209&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

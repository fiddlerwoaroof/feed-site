<p>We've tended to treat the RNA-based vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech as functionally equivalent. They take an identical approach to producing immunity and have a very similar set of ingredients. Clinical trial data suggested they had very similar efficacy—both in the area of 95 percent.</p>
<p>So it was a bit of a surprise to have a paper released yesterday indicating that the two produce an antibody response that's easy to distinguish, with Moderna inducing antibody levels that were more than double that seen among people who received the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. While it's important not to infer too much from a single study, this one was large enough that the results are likely to be reliable. If so, the results serve as a caution that we might not want to base too many of our expectations on relatively crude measures of antibody levels.</p>
<h2>The new study</h2>
<p>The work itself was remarkably simple. A Belgian medical center was vaccinating its staff and asked for volunteers willing to give blood samples. Samples were taken both prior to vaccination and six to 10 weeks after, with the levels of antibody specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein tested at both points. About 700 participants received the Moderna vaccine, while roughly 950 took the one from Pfizer/BioNTech.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791049#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791049&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>General Motors has lost confidence in battery supplier LG Chem after defective cells from the company caused a string of fires and sparked a massive recall of Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles and electric utility vehicles.</p>
<p>The automaker recalled more than 140,000 electric cars and crossovers—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/gm-recalls-every-chevy-bolt-ever-made-blames-lg-for-faulty-batteries/">every single one that the company has made</a>—when it discovered two simultaneously occurring defects in the LG-made batteries. GM suspects the defects are behind the 10 fires the company has identified so far.</p>
<p>LG Chem makes the battery packs for every Chevy Bolt, and while the problem was initially traced to one of LG's Korean plants, subsequent investigations revealed that other LG plants were pumping out bad cells, too.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790994#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790994&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Originally slated for an April 2020 release, the film was first postponed until November 2020 and then delayed again until April 2021. While some theaters remain closed around the world, MGM is sticking with its latest release dates: a world premiere at Royal Albert Hall in London on September 28, 2021, followed by a general release on September 30 in the UK and October 8 in the US.

<p>The latest legal decision in a years-long fight over how to implement the Clean Water Act has set rules back to where they were in the 1980s. The reversion is the product of the Trump administration's haste to get rid of Obama-era regulations, leading to action that produced rules running counter to the Environmental Protection Agency's own scientific findings. As a result, a judge has decided that the rules cannot remain in place for the time that will be needed for the Biden administration to formulate replacements.</p>
<h2>Defining water</h2>
<p>The long-running saga is the product of the Clean Water Act's remarkably vague protections. The act seeks to control pollution via a permitting process that applies to the “waters of the United States," but it doesn't define what constitutes said waters.</p>
<p>While the process would clearly apply to a flowing river, it's less clear whether the act would regulate the pollution of a stream bed only filled seasonally or following heavy rains—even though the stream bed can flow directly into a river that is active year-round. Similar issues apply to items like man-made ponds that connect to other bodies via groundwater flow.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790905#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790905&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Over 135 subreddits have gone dark this week in protest of Reddit's refusal to ban communities that spread misinformation about the COVID pandemic and vaccines.</p>
<p>Subreddits that went private include two with 10 million or more subscribers, namely r/Futurology and r/TIFU. The PokemonGo community is one of 15 other subreddits with at least 1 million subscribers that went private; another 15 subreddits with at least 500,000 subscribers also went private. They're all listed in a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N8theGr8/comments/pelle1/subs_going_dark/">r/VaxxHappened</a> which has been coordinating opposition to Reddit management's stance on pandemic misinformation. More subreddits are being added as they join the protest.</p>
<p>"Futurology has gone private to protest Reddit's inaction on COVID-19 misinformation," a message on that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futurology">subreddit</a> says. "Reddit won't enforce their policies against misinformation, brigading, and spamming. Misinformation subreddits such as NoNewNormal and r/conspiracy must be shut down.

<p>Nearly a decade ago, Theranos touted a revolutionary diagnostic device that could run myriad medical tests without having to draw blood through a needle. Today, the startup’s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, goes to court, where she’s facing 12 criminal counts for statements she made to investors and consumers about her company’s technology.</p>
<p>Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 after dropping out of Stanford University at the age of 19. Driven by her phobia of needles, Holmes wanted to create diagnostic tests that use blood from finger pricks rather than from needles. The idea caught on, attracting well-connected board members like Henry Kissinger and James Mattis, drawing over $400 million in investments from wealthy investors including Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch, and securing lucrative partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway. At its peak, Theranos was worth over $9 billion.</p>
<p>But Theranos’ myth started unwinding in 2015 when a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">Wall Street Journal investigation</a> revealed that the company had been performing most of its tests on traditional blood diagnostic machines rather than its own “Einstein” device. The company’s own employees doubted the machine’s accuracy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790858#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790858&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>South Korea will soon pass a law banning Apple's and Google's app store payment requirements. An amendment to South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act will stop app store owners from requiring developers to use in-house payment systems. The law also bans app store owners from unreasonably delaying the approval of apps or deleting them from the marketplace, which the country fears is used as a method of retaliation. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-apple-hit-in-south-korea-by-worlds-first-law-ending-their-dominance-over-app-store-payments-11630403335">The Wall Street Journal</a> reports, the law has passed South Korea's National Assembly (the country's Congress equivalent), and President Moon Jae-in is expected to sign the bill into law.</p>
<p>In the rest of the world, Apple and Google get a 30 percent cut of most app purchases, in-app sales, and subscriptions, and the companies don't allow developers to use alternative payment options. Once the bill passes in South Korea, app developers will be free to search for a payments provider that offers them the best deal. Google's and Apple's stores do provide some benefits, like user authentication for purchases, friction-free purchases thanks to stored payment information, and easy data hosting and distribution for digital goods. If developers don't need any of those things or are willing to roll their own solutions, standard credit card processors usually only take a 1-3 percent cut of sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes">The Verge</a> received statements from both Google and Apple. A Google spokesperson told the site, “Just as it costs developers money to build an app, it costs us money to build and maintain an operating system and app store. We’ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790836#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790836&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Roughly six weeks before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/far-cry-6-gameplay-reveal-ride-a-horse-pet-a-dog-set-lots-of-things-on-fire/"><em>Far Cry 6</em></a>'s upcoming launch on PC and consoles, Ubisoft elected to unlock the entirety of this first-person shooter's opening beats for a press-only, hands-on demo. This kind of access differs from the carefully selected "slices" we sometimes play in preview events, as those are meant to show an unfinished game in its best light.</p>
<p>But after going hands-on with <em>Far Cry 6</em> for nearly four hours, I was reminded why game studios are sometimes cagey about prerelease reveals.</p>
<p>The demo I played was equal parts massive and unwieldy. I couldn't help but feel like hundreds of Ubisoft staffers' efforts to create a beautiful and convincing pseudo-Cuban adventure wound up squeezed into a single, tiny clown car of a package. The issues didn't end with game-breaking bugs and wonky AI, which may very well be resolved on, erm, October 7. At this point, I'm more concerned about uninspiring new loadout systems, a narrative tone that can't make up its mind, and an absolute yawn of a return to the Ubisoft open-world bloat of old.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790742#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790742&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>These days, I'm just as excited about the electrification of vehicles like school buses and garbage trucks as I am about passenger cars. Replacing a hot and noisy gasoline or diesel powertrain with batteries and electric motors makes life better for the drivers (and riders, in the case of a bus), with less noise and vibration—benefits that extend to everyone else in the area, too.</p>
<p>Even better is that school districts around the country are in the process of electrifying their bus fleets. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/maryland-school-district-places-largest-ever-order-for-electric-buses/">Montgomery County, Maryland,</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/12/virginia-has-big-plans-for-electric-school-buses-in-2020/">the Commonwealth of Virginia</a> have both announced ambitious plans that also involve using the buses as vehicle-to-grid energy storage when they're not in use.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia, which is sandwiched between Montgomery County and Northern Virginia, is also finalizing its electrification roadmap. Unlike its suburban neighbors, its fleet of buses are the <a href="https://www.ncuaqmd.org/images/BusTypeDefinitions.pdf">smaller Type A buses</a>, but there's an ever-growing selection of these vehicles to choose from.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790821#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790821&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Publicly, NASA is still holding on to the possibility of a 2021 launch date for the debut flight of its Space Launch System rocket. This week, an agency spokesperson told Ars that "NASA is working toward a launch for the Artemis I mission by the end of this year."</p>
<p>However, a source said the best-case scenario for launching the Artemis 1 mission is spring of next year, with summer being the more realistic target for a test flight of the heavy lift rocket and Orion spacecraft. The space agency is already running about two months behind internal targets for testing and integrating the rocket at Kennedy Space Center, and the critical pre-flight tests remain ahead.</p>

<p>NASA's Kathryn Hambleton acknowledged that the space agency has seen schedule slips. "The agency continues to monitor the rise of COVID cases in the Kennedy area, which, combined with other factors such as weather and first time operations, is impacting our schedule of operations," she said. "Moving step by step, we are progressing toward launch while keeping our team as safe as possible."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790199#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790199&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap">
<figure class="intro-image intro-left"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-11.34.41-PM-800x450.jpg" alt="Windows 11 arrives on October 5, Android apps will come later"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-30-at-11.34.41-PM.jpg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="1080" data-width="1920">Enlarge</a> (credit: Microsoft)</p>  </figure><div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Windows 11 is no longer merely "coming this fall." Microsoft will begin releasing the new operating system to the public <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176111">on October 5</a>, starting with newer PCs (and PCs being sold in stores) and then rolling out to other supported systems over the next nine or so months. The company also says that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/microsofts-windows-subsystem-for-android-sounds-a-lot-like-chrome-os/">Amazon-powered Android app support</a> coming to Windows 11 won't be ready for public consumption at launch; Microsoft will offer "a preview [of Android apps in the Microsoft Store] for Windows Insiders over the coming months."</p>
<p>Like recent Windows 10 updates, Windows 11 will have a phased rollout through Windows Update—most PCs won't begin to see and automatically install the update on October 5. Microsoft says that new PCs will be the first to upgrade, followed by older compatible PCs, "based on intelligence models that consider hardware eligibility, reliability metrics, age of device and other factors." As with Windows 10 updates, you'll be able to download an ISO file to initiate the upgrade yourself (Microsoft also offers tools like the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/windows-10-update-assistant-3550dfb2-a015-7765-12ea-fba2ac36fb3f">Windows Update Assistant</a> to manually trigger upgrade installs; we assume the company will provide this system for Windows 11, too). All compatible PCs should be offered the update by mid-2022.</p>

<p>For PCs that don't meet Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/loosened-windows-11-requirements-cover-the-surface-studio-2-but-not-much-else/">stringent system requirements</a>—a recent 64-bit Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm processor; enabled Secure Boot support; and a TPM 2.0 module along with 4GB or more of RAM and 64GB or more of storage—Microsoft has been cagey. Neither today's announcement nor a post from last week explaining the security requirements mentions being able to install Windows 11 on unsupported PCs. But Microsoft told reporters that it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/youll-be-able-to-run-windows-11-on-older-pcs-if-you-install-the-update-manually/">won't disallow installation on incompatible systems</a> as long as you install the operating system manually, but the company can later assert its right to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/microsoft-may-withhold-security-updates-from-unsupported-windows-11-pcs/">withhold security and driver updates on those PCs</a> if it wants to.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790756#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790756&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Wind power doesn't make up the largest part of the United States' energy mix, but it grew over the last year, according to the <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/wind-technologies-market-report/">Wind Technologies Market Report</a>. The renewable energy source increased to more than 8 percent of the country's electricity supply—reaching 10 percent in a growing number of states—and saw a whopping $25 billion in investments in what will translate to 16.8 gigawatts of capacity, according to the report.</p>
<p>Released by the US Department of Energy, the sizeable report draws on a variety of data sources, including government data from the Energy Information Administration, trade data from the US International Trade Commission, and hourly pricing data from the various system operators. “The report itself covers the entire gamut of the US wind industry,” Mark Bolinger, a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and one of the authors of the report, told Ars.</p>
<h2>Bigger is sometimes better</h2>
<p>According to the report, the performance of wind power operations in the US has improved a great deal. We can measure this metric based on capacity factor, a ratio of the amount of energy a turbine actually produces compared to the amount it could have made if it ran at its peak constantly. For recently constructed wind power projects, the average capacity factor has now cleared 40 percent. The biggest gains in this area, however, are seen in the US's “wind belt,” a region that stretches from the Dakotas to Texas and receives a large amount of wind.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790689#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790689&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>65 mpg without hypermiling in the Lincoln Aviator hybrid</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Lincoln hits most of the right notes with the plug-in hybrid version of the Aviator.]]></description>

        <p>
          That subdued Aviator nameplate is much better than spelling out the model name across the front of the hood. I'm looking at you, F-L-E-X.                      [credit:
                        Eric Bangean                        ]
                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul><p>Temptation comes in different forms, especially behind the wheel. With a plug-in hybrid SUV, there are two competing urges. Sometimes, the move is to put it in Sport mode and scream down the highway to take full advantage of the hybrid powertrain. In the case of the Lincoln Aviator, the urge was to ignore the engine altogether, instead relying on electrons rather than hydrocarbons for propulsion. To Lincoln's credit, the Aviator made that an easy choice.</p>
<p>In revamping its SUV lineup, Lincoln has gone hard for big grilles and classic styling, both of which the Aviator has. It sports classic SUV contours, but the slope of the windshield and the tapering top, paired with the Aviator nameplate on the front quarter panels, give it a light art deco vibe. The mid-size, three-row Aviator plugs into Lincoln's lineup between the full-size Navigator and the compact <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/05/the-2019-lincoln-nautilus-how-does-american-luxury-stack-up/">Nautilus</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Aviator's comfortable interior doesn't show the same level of design elegance. The materials all feel high-quality—there are scads of leather and wood trim—but it's busy. A massive center console makes what should be a spacious front row feel slightly cramped. But the seats are excellent, and both front row occupants can sink into the Aviator's 30-way (!) adjustable seats. The second-row captain’s chairs are roomy and comfortable, but the third row is difficult to get into and is best suited for kids.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788660#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788660&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase sent an automated message to a large number of its customers on Friday, saying: "Your 2-step verification settings have been changed." Unfortunately, the message was sent in error—by Coinbase's count, 125,000 of those messages were sent (via email and SMS text) to customers whose 2FA settings had not changed.</p>
<p>According to Coinbase's own <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1431729517475758083">acknowledgment</a> Saturday, its system began sending the erroneous messages at 1:45 pm Pacific time on Friday and kept sending them until the error was mitigated at 3:07 pm.</p>
<p>In that Twitter thread, Coinbase acknowledges the mistaken 2FA messages' potential for confusion—confusion which retiree Don Pirtle <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/coinbase-sent-erroneous-account-security-notifications-to-125000-customers.html">told</a> CNBC led him to panic-sell more than $60,000 of cryptocurrency.

<p>The mantis shrimp boasts one of the most powerful, ultrafast punches in nature—it's on par with the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2182882-mantis-shrimps-punch-with-the-force-of-a-bullet-and-now-we-know-how/" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2182882-mantis-shrimps-punch-with-the-force-of-a-bullet-and-now-we-know-how/" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1630356902458jad" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1630356902458jad">force generated</a> by a .22 caliber bullet. This makes the creature an attractive object of study for scientists eager to learn more about the relevant biomechanics. Among other uses, it could lead to small robots capable of equally fast, powerful movements. Now, a team of Harvard University researchers has come up with a new biomechanical model for the mantis shrimp's mighty appendage, and it built a tiny robot to mimic that movement, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2026833118">a recent paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>
<p>“We are fascinated by so many remarkable behaviors we see in nature, in particular when these behaviors meet or exceed what can be achieved by human-made devices,” <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/08/robot-mimics-powerful-punch-mantis-shrimp">said senior author Robert Wood,</a> a roboticist at Harvard University's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). “The speed and force of mantis shrimp strikes, for example, are a consequence of a complex underlying mechanism. By constructing a robotic model of a mantis shrimp striking appendage, we are able to study these mechanisms in unprecedented detail.”</p>
<p>Wood's research group made headlines several years ago when it constructed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboBee">RoboBee</a>, a tiny robot capable of partially untethered flight. The ultimate goal of that initiative is to build a swarm of tiny interconnected robots capable of sustained untethered flight—a significant technological challenge, given the insect-sized scale, which changes the various forces at play. In 2019, Wood's group <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1322-0">announced its achievement</a> of the lightest insect-scale robot so far to have achieved sustained, untethered flight—an improved version called the RoboBee X-Wing. (Kenny Breuer, writing in Nature, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01964-3">described it</a> as "a tour de force of system design and engineering.")</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788373#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788373&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A county judge in Ohio has ordered a hospital in Cincinnati to administer ivermectin to an intensive care patient, a move raises questions about the role of the courts in the medical system.</p>
<p>“It is absurd that this order was issued,” <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/arthur-l-caplan">Arthur Caplan</a>, professor of bioethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, told Ars. “If I were these doctors, I simply wouldn’t do it.”</p>
<p>The order was spurred by a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051020-j-smith-ivermectin-complaint">lawsuit</a> filed by Julie Smith, whose 51-year-old husband, Jeffrey, is being treated in West Chester Hospital for COVID-19. The lawsuit was first reported by the <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/08/30/judge-orders-cinci-hospital-to-treat-covid-19-patient-with-ivermectin-despite-cdc-warnings/">Ohio Capital Journal</a>. Jeffrey has been in the hospital since July 15, and as his condition declined, his wife Julie began investigating alternative treatments.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790673#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790673&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T today said that only 60 percent of its network in Louisiana is working as Hurricane Ida pummels the state. T-Mobile is reporting similarly extensive outages, while Verizon says it has minimized outages with backup generators. AT&amp;T and T-Mobile both said they have deployed additional generators but the carriers apparently didn't deploy enough to handle the widespread power outages.</p>
<p>"Our Louisiana wireless network is operating at 60 percent of normal and we have significant outages in New Orleans and Baton Rouge due to power outages, flooding and storm damage," AT&amp;T said in a <a href="https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/storm_ida.html">network-status update</a>. "We had key network facilities go offline overnight, and while some have already been restored, some facilities remain down and are inaccessible due to flooding and storm damage."</p>
<p>AT&amp;T said it has "mobilized additional disaster recovery equipment in the region to assist in the recovery and will work around the clock until service is restored." AT&amp;T said its wireless network in Alabama is operating normally and that it's "seen only a very small wireless impact in Mississippi."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790650#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790650&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Friday, the CDC released <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e2.htm?s_cid=mm7035e2_w">a report</a> that traced the spread of the delta variant through a California elementary school. It's tempting to make this into a story of gross irresponsibility—a teacher was unvaccinated and read to the class while unmasked. But beyond that, it provides a number of warnings about how our public health system remains under stress as we close in on two years since the start of the pandemic. It also reemphasizes how the delta variant ensures that small errors can easily explode into big problems.</p>
<h2>One bad apple</h2>
<p>The school in question was a small one, with only a bit over 200 students and 24 staff. It is an elementary school, meaning that its student population is also younger than the cutoff for approved vaccine use. The school did a number of things right, though. Class sizes were kept small, and individual classes were kept in separate rooms, with doors and windows kept open and air filtration equipment installed. There was also a standing policy requiring mask use in place.</p>
<p>But not everything was ideal. The CDC notes that two of the 24 staff members were unvaccinated. While the vaccinated can clearly transmit the delta variant, they are likely to be less infectious, and in a worst case they'd be infectious for a shorter period of time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790651#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790651&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Archaeologists working in Pompeii recently unearthed the tomb and partially mummified remains of a man who died a few decades before the eruption. The man, Marcus Venerius Secundio, according to his epitaph, had once been enslaved, but by the end of his life he’d obtained enough wealth and status to sponsor four days of theater performances in Pompeii.</p>
<h2>Rags to riches in Imperial Rome</h2>
<p>Archaeologists rediscovered Marcus Venerius Secundio’s tomb in the ancient cemetery, or necropolis, of Porta Sarno in the eastern part of Pompeii, where tourists aren’t allowed. His tomb was large and imposing, with a colorfully painted facade depicting green plants on a blue background; traces of the paint still cling to the stone even after 2,000 years. It was also sealed so well that its occupant’s remains had partially mummified, preserving some soft tissue and a few tufts of white hair, along with some scraps of fabric.</p>
<p>Because Pompeii is both amazingly well-preserved and extensively studied, archaeologists were able to match the name inscribed over the tomb’s entrance to a name on wax tablets in the house of a banker named Lucius Caecilius Jucundus, across the city from the necropolis. The banker’s tablets recorded Marcus as a “public slave” who worked as a custodian in the Temple of Venus, which once stood at the western end of town (that’s almost certainly where the second part of his name, Venerius, comes from). But at some point he became a libertus, or freedman, and began to build a new life for himself.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790463#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790463&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

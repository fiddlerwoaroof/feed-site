<p>Respiratory illnesses are raging this fall, slamming children particularly hard. Cases of influenza-like illnesses are off to a startlingly strong and early start this season. RSV—respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus—continues to skyrocket. A stew of SARS-CoV-2 variants is still simmering in the background. And the rabble of usual cold-season viruses, such as rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, is also making the rounds.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSV.jpg"><img alt="RSV national trends." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSV-640x290.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSV-1280x581.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSV.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">RSV national trends.</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">CDC</a>)</p></div>
<p>With the surge in infections, children's hospitals around the country have reported being at capacity or overwhelmed, as Ars has reported before. But another effect of the crush of viruses is a squeeze on the workforce. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/11/15/work-absences-childcare/">The Washington Post first reported Tuesday</a>, the US broke its record last month for people missing work due to childcare problems—such as having children home sick and childcare facilities or schools shuttered due to staffing shortages and sickness.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/outpatient-visits.jpg"><img alt="Outpatient respiratory illness visits." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/outpatient-visits-640x450.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/outpatient-visits-1280x899.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/outpatient-visits.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Outpatient respiratory illness visits.</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm">CDC</a>)</p></div>
<p>In October, more than 100,000 employed Americans missed work for childcare-related problems, <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02096055">according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. That is more missing workers than in any other month in recent records, including the entirety of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many childcare facilities and schools closed down for extended periods. At the height of pandemic-related shutdowns in 2020, the number of Americans missing work for childcare problems only reached the low 90,000s.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898421#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A few weeks ago, some early adopters of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rtx-4090-review-nvidias-biggest-gpu-is-easily-its-best/">Nvidia's new flagship RTX 4090 GPU</a> began reporting that the cards' power connectors were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/nvidia-is-investigating-reports-of-melting-geforce-rtx-4090-power-connectors/">overheating and melting their plastic casing</a>, sometimes causing damage to the outrageously fast and expensive GPUs.</p>
<p>For Nvidia's part, the company is still looking into the failures. "We continue to investigate the reports, however we don't have further details to share yet," according to an Nvidia rep <a href="https://twitter.com/kitgurupress/status/1591116997613748224?s=20&amp;t=6LcQhXlOptJ0Bh6HurrNrg">talking to KitGuru</a> earlier this week. But the YouTubers at the Gamers Nexus channel have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig2px7ofKhQ">conducting their own in-depth research</a>, and in short, they believe that the problems are mostly being caused by improperly seated power connectors. "Foreign-object debris" inside the connector can also cause problems, but Gamers Nexus believes this kind of damage is much rarer.</p>
<p>The failure that Gamers Nexus was able to re-create in its labs involved connecting the 12VHPWR power connector to an RTX 4090 without inserting it fully and then bending the cable to one side, making the connection even worse. After just a few minutes of testing, the loose connection's high power resistance generated heat above 250° Celsius, causing smoke and visible bubbling as the connector melted in its socket.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898349#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898349&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Wednesday, Nvidia <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai">announced</a> a collaboration with Microsoft to build a "massive" cloud computer focused on AI. It will reportedly use tens of thousands of high-end Nvidia GPUs for applications like deep learning and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/twitter-pranksters-derail-gpt-3-bot-with-newly-discovered-prompt-injection-hack/">large language models</a>. The companies aim to make it one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world.</p>

<p>In turn, the new supercomputer will feature thousands of units of what is arguably the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/nvidias-flagship-ai-chip-reportedly-4-5x-faster-than-the-previous-champ/">most powerful GPU</a> in the world, the Hopper H100, which Nvidia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/hopper-time-nvidias-most-powerful-ai-chip-yet-ships-in-october/">launched</a> in October. Nvidia will also provide its second most powerful GPU, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/nvidia-ditches-intel-cozies-up-to-amd-with-its-new-dgx-a100/">A100</a>, and utilize its <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/infiniband/">Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> networking platform, which can transfer data at 400 gigabits per second between servers, linking them together into a powerful cluster.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft will contribute its Azure cloud infrastructure and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nd-series">ND-</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nc-series">NC-series</a> virtual machines. Nvidia's <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">AI Enterprise platform</a> will tie the whole thing together. The companies will also collaborate on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/">DeepSpeed</a>, Microsoft's deep learning optimization software.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898351#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898351&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon has started a round of layoffs that reportedly could cut about 10,000 jobs. Layoffs began yesterday in the Amazon hardware <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services">division</a> that makes products including Echo, Alexa, Fire, and Kindle devices.</p>
<p>"We notified impacted employees yesterday, and will continue to work closely with each individual to provide support, including assisting in finding new roles," Amazon Senior VP of Devices &amp; Services Dave Limp wrote to his department's staff today in a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/a-team-update-from-dave-limp">memo posted publicly by Amazon</a>. Limp wrote that Amazon "continue[s] to face an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment... After a deep set of reviews, we recently decided to consolidate some teams and programs."</p>
<p>"It pains me to have to deliver this news as we know we will lose talented Amazonians from the Devices &amp; Services org as a result... While I know this news is tough to digest, I do want to emphasize that the Devices &amp; Services organization remains an important area of investment for Amazon," the memo said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898348#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898348&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Just last month, the James Webb Telescope <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/stunning-new-webb-telescope-image-showcases-the-pillars-of-creation/">gifted us</a> a spectacular new image of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation" data-uri="91c249a6b70d72a0c9db41150540c6a5">Pillars of Creation</a>—arguably the most famous image taken by Webb's predecessor, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" data-uri="73049d21685b2574059367b1a8a07280">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, in 1995. Now the telescope is giving astronomers clues about the formation of a new star, with a <a href="https://esawebb.org/news/weic2219/?lang">stunning image</a> of an hourglass-shaped dark cloud surrounding a protostar, an object known as L1527.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/stunning-new-webb-telescope-image-showcases-the-pillars-of-creation/">reported previously</a>, the James Webb Space Telescope launched in December 2021 and, after a suspenseful sunshield and mirror deployment <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/nasa-completes-most-challenging-part-of-the-webb-telescopes-deployment/" data-uri="8012d6c2f5f8f0560ba5f1b4b6705097">over several months</a>, began capturing stunning images. First, there was the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/webbs-first-light-reveals-a-plethora-of-galaxies-in-a-tiny-patch-of-sky/" data-uri="8e5ea4b93de4cb1a7a887de0e7ebdb18">deep field image</a> of the Universe, released in July. This was followed by images of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/the-other-firsts-the-rest-of-the-first-five-webb-telescope-images/" data-uri="6dcb3b5ef857b6da0ef2d93c0e95ef3b">exoplanet atmospheres</a>, the Southern Ring Nebula, a cluster of interacting galaxies called Stephan's Quintet, and the Carina Nebula, a star-forming region about 7,600 light-years away.</p>
<p>In August, we received <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/new-webb-images-of-jupiter-show-dazzling-auroras-and-two-small-moons/" data-uri="892b7229f7dbf4d0db05029b1300109f">gorgeous images</a> of Jupiter, including the auroras at both poles that result from Jupiter's powerful magnetic field, as well as its thin rings and two of the gas giant's small moons. This was followed a month later by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/astounding-new-webb-image-reveals-tens-of-thousands-of-young-stars/" data-uri="a24624c9774d4b6afd50eeac4c3a8bd1">a mosaic image</a> showing a panorama of star formation stretching across a staggering 340 light-years in the Tarantula Nebula—so named because of its long, dusty filaments. We also were treated to spectacular images of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/webb-telescope-captures-dazzling-views-of-neptune-and-its-moons/" data-uri="7bf3cadf7ca0e5b27d22aa28535725f0">Neptune and its rings</a>, which have not been directly observed since Voyager 2 flew by the planet in 1989, and, as already mentioned, the Pillars of Creation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898238#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898238&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Formula 1 cars take to the track for the first time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/smaller-more-slippery-more-sustainable-cars-f1s-plan-for-2026/">in 2026</a>, they'll do so powered by carbon-neutral synthetic fuels, part of the sport's "net zero by 2030" plan. It's a laudable goal, but, I confess, one I've sometimes questioned. After all, most of the carbon emitted during the course of an F1 weekend comes from the same sources as any other popular sport—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/mercedes-f1-team-cut-its-freight-emissions-by-89-with-biofuel-switch/">the teams</a> and fans traveling to and from the event. But after speaking with Pat Symonds, Formula 1's chief technical officer, I may have been missing the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>"In essence, yes, you're quite right. The total carbon footprint of the sport—of scope 1, 2—is just over a quarter million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, and the cars on the circuit represent 0.7 percent of that," Symonds explained to me. "So yes, your premise is true. But we try and take a much wider view. And what I think we have in developing a sustainable fuel and putting it in our race cars is an enormous multiplier effect. The 2 billion vehicles that are out there could use this fuel, and then the 400,000 people driving to [the US Grand Prix] isn't a problem," he said.</p>
<p>Formula 1 has changed quite a bit in the years since Liberty Media bought it at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/09/formula-1-to-be-bought-by-us-based-liberty-media-group/">the end of 2016</a> with bigger ideas than simply sucking revenue out. Instead of pretending the Internet never happened, you can now watch races via F1's own streaming service, a service that has markedly improved over the past couple of years. In the US, a move to ESPN saw the sport <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/formula-1-on-espn-sees-massive-improvement-indycar-thrilled-in-phoenix/">go commercial-free</a> during the actual races. And, of course, there's the whole <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/netflixs-formula-1-drive-to-survive-finds-pressure-at-the-core-of-f1/">Drive to Survive</a></em> phenomena, which has boosted audiences worldwide—but particularly in North America, which next year will host grands prix in Austin, Texas; Miami; and Las Vegas.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898301#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898301&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Privacy-focused search site DuckDuckGo has added yet another way to prevent more of your data from going to advertisers, opening its <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/p/9d8b46eb-36a3-4e9c-854d-5e629abe993e/">App Tracking Protection for Android</a> to beta testers.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo is positioning App Tracking Protection as something like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/how-apples-new-app-tracking-transparency-policy-works/">Apple's App Tracking Transparency</a> for iOS devices, but "even more powerful." Enabling the service in the DuckDuckGo app for Android (under the "More from DuckDuckGo" section) installs a local VPN service on your phone, which can then start automatically blocking trackers on DDG's <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-blocklists/tree/main/web">public blocklist</a>. DuckDuckGo says this happens "without sending app data to DuckDuckGo or other remote servers."</p>

<p>A measles outbreak in Ohio has swiftly expanded, spreading to seven childcare facilities and one school, all with unvaccinated children, according to local health officials. The outbreak highlights the risk of the highly contagious but vaccine-preventable disease mushrooming amid slipping vaccination rates.</p>
<p>On November 9, the health departments of the city of Columbus and Franklin County, which encompasses Columbus, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/measles-outbreak-erupts-among-unvaccinated-children-in-ohio-daycare/">announced an outbreak</a> at one childcare facility, which had sickened four unvaccinated children. Officials reportedly expected that more cases would follow.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday morning, there have been 18 confirmed cases from seven childcare facilities and one school. All of the cases are in unvaccinated children, and at least 15 cases are in children under the age of 4. At least six have required hospitalization, Kelli Newman, spokesperson for Columbus Public Health, told Ars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898258#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898258&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

(credit: Razer)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Owners of the latest Ryzen 6000-based version of Razer's 14-inch Blade laptop are getting a significant update soon: The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23458088/razer-2022-blade-14-gaming-laptop-amd-usb-c-4-thunderbolt-software-update">confirmed to The Verge</a> that a BIOS update for the laptop would add USB 4 support to its USB-C ports, doubling the transfer speeds from 20Gbps to 40Gbps and adding support for high-bandwidth, Thunderbolt-compatible external accessories like external GPU docks.</p>
<p>USB 4 is kind-of-sort-of feature compatible with Thunderbolt, the spec that Intel <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/thunderbolt-3-becomes-usb4-as-intels-interconnect-goes-royalty-free/">made royalty-free in 2019</a>. Like Thunderbolt 3 and 4, a fully enabled USB 4 port supports data-transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps and PCIe tunneling for support of external GPUs and other high-speed accessories. Some USB 4 ports only support the spec's minimum speed of 20Gbps, the same speed as USB 3.2 Gen 2, but Razer's ports do appear to be fully enabled 40Gbps ports.</p>
<p>Razer isn't doing anything particularly special to boost its USB speeds. Rather, it's taking advantage of the USB 4 capabilities that are built into all Ryzen 6000 processors. As long as a laptop's manufacturer included the hardware necessary to support USB 4 speeds, any manufacturer can "upgrade" to USB 4 via a firmware update and a chipset driver that <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-usb4-chipset-driver-update-for-ryzen-6000">AMD released over the summer</a>. PCWorld tested Ryzen 6000's USB 4 support <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/703578/usb4-support-amd-ryzen-6000-laptop.html">on an Asus ZenBook</a> that also required a BIOS update before it supported the feature.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898209#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898209&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On opening night of August's Gamescom conference, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/sony-enters-the-high-end-custom-controller-arena-with-the-dualsense-edge/">PlayStation announced</a> its new PlayStation 5 controller, the DualSense Edge. With the new iteration, players can remap inputs and save them as custom profiles and even replace physical buttons and add levers to the controller’s backside.</p>
<p>Though these changes offer a certain level of accessibility, neither the announcement nor the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/23/introducing-the-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-the-ultra-customizable-controller-for-playstation-5/">accompanying blog post</a> suggests this was deliberate. Rather, the DualSense Edge is a “high-performance, ultra customizable” gamepad ostensibly aimed at competitive gamers. At its heart, the Edge remains the same-old DualSense, and, as such, its accessibility improvements feel incidental rather than intended.</p>
<p>That has been something of a disappointment to gaming accessibility advocates and players who rely on non-standard controls. In the wake of Microsoft’s success with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/xbox-adaptive-controller-a-bold-answer-to-the-tricky-world-of-accessible-gaming/">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>, Sony’s lack of similarly accessible control options for the PlayStation 5 is starting to stick out like a sore thumb(stick).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898244#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898244&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, a paper was released that describes some confusing results from the National Ignition Facility, which uses a lot of very energetic lasers focused on a small target to begin a fusion reaction. Over the past few years, the facility has passed some key milestones, including ignition of fusion and creating what's termed a burning plasma.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have analyzed the properties of the plasma as it experiences these high-energy states. And to their surprise, they found that burning plasmas appear to behave differently from those that have experienced ignition. At the moment, there's no obvious explanation for the difference.</p>
<h2>Ignition vs. burning</h2>
<p>In the experiments, the material being used for fusion is a mix of tritium and deuterium, two heavier isotopes of hydrogen. These combine to produce a helium atom, leaving a spare neutron that's emitted; the energy of the fusion reaction is released in the form of a gamma ray.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898219#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898219&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dawn breaks in San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. The city is still asleep, but the early risers are greeted by a beautiful symphony: Hummingbirds, corn-eaters, <em>yigüirros</em> (clay-colored thrushes), yellow-breasted grosbeaks, blue tanagers, house wrens, warblers and other birds announce that a new day has arrived.</p>
<p>Soon the incessant noise of vehicles and their horns, construction, street vendors, and more take over, shaping the soundscape of the frenetic routine of hundreds of thousands of people who travel and live in this city. Then, the birds’ songs will slip into the background.</p>
<p>“The act of birdsong has two main functions in males: It is to attract females and also to defend their territory from other males,” says Luis Andrés Sandoval Vargas, an ornithologist at the University of Costa Rica. For females in the tropics, he adds, the primary role of their song is to defend territory. Thus, in order to communicate in cities, to keep their territory safe and find mates, birds must find ways to counteract the effects of anthropogenic noise—that is, the noise produced by humans.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898208#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898208&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Today, Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, the company's flagship chip that will be coming to many Android phones over the next few months. Besides the usual newer, better, hopefully faster cores, a big piece of news is the addition of Wi-Fi 7 support so you can get better home wireless—provided you invest in a new router.</p>
<p>Qualcomm has some claims for this new chip. The company says the CPU "improves performance up to 35 percent" and has "up to 40 percent more power efficiency." The GPU supposedly "delivers up to 25 percent faster performance, with up to 45 percent better power efficiency." Take both of these claims with a grain of salt, since Qualcomm last year promised a <a href="https://youtu.be/3H6tfcZLHfg?t=6773">20 percent CPU improvement</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review-the-slab-phone-retirement-plan/4/">never manifested</a> in shipping products. Even if Qualcomm hits these performance promises, it would still be about a year behind the iPhone. The company is trying to do something about its uncompetitive performance with the (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/arm-sues-qualcomm-over-its-1-4-billion-nuvia-acquisition/">now legally encumbered</a>) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/qualcomm-closes-nuvia-deal-promises-in-house-laptop-cpus-by-2h-2022/">Nuvia acquisition</a>, but those chips aren't ready yet.</p>
<p>Let's start with the basics. This is a 4 nm chip with an unusual layout containing four different CPU cores, all designed by Arm. The prime core is a 3.2 GHz Arm Cortex X3—that's all good and expected, and from here, Arm's recommended layout is three Cortex A710 CPUs for "medium" duty and four A510 CPUs for low-power background processing. Qualcomm isn't following the recommended layout, though, and after the Cortex X3 it has two different cores doing "medium" duty: a pair of Cortex-A715 CPUs and a pair of last-generation Cortex-A710 CPUs. After that, there are only three—not the expected four—Cortex A510 CPUs doing background duty.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1897640#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1897640&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Earlier this month, a programmer and hobbyist named Allison Parrish debuted a <a href="https://posts.decontextualize.com/pocket-sp/">compact hack</a> of the 1996 Nintendo <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Pocket">Game Boy Pocket</a> handheld game console. Taking inspiration from the later Game Boy Advance SP, she fabricated a custom plastic shell with a hinge so the older monochrome Game Boy can fold shut. She calls it the Game Boy Pocket SP.</p>

<p>In Parrish's extensive write-up of the mod, she explains that her hack began as something of a joke. The Game Boy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/04/how-to-make-your-old-game-boy-as-good-as-or-better-than-new/">modding community</a> is popular right now, and one currently trending mod involves transplanting the circuitry of a folding Game Boy Advance SP (from 2003) into a <a href="https://www.boxypixel.com/collections/game-boy-advance-sp/products/game-boy-advance-sp-unhinged">non-folding custom shell</a>. So she thought, "If y'all can take the hinge out of an SP, why can't I add a hinge to a Game Boy that never had one?"</p>
<p>Parrish, who is an assistant arts professor at NYU, built her complex folding mod over the summer using tools at her university department's <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">ITP/IMA shop</a> and the NYU Makerspace. Its unique clamshell design comes courtesy of a Game Boy Pocket motherboard she cut in half, along with custom-design flex PCBs (printed circuit boards) that route signals between the two folding halves. To pull it all together, Parrish designed a <a href="https://github.com/aparrish/pocket-sp/">3D-printed plastic shell</a> using FreeCAD.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898074#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898074&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In 1991, a group of hikers found the mummified remains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi">Ötzi the Iceman</a> emerging from a melting glacier. The popular interpretation—given the extraordinary preservation of the body—is that Ötzi fled from the valley after being attacked and froze to death in the gully where his mummified remains were found. His body and the tools he brought with him were quickly buried beneath the ice and remained frozen under a moving glacier for the next 5,300 years. The gully served as a kind of time capsule, protecting the remains from damage by the glacier.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09596836221126133">new paper</a> published in the journal The Holocene challenges that interpretation, suggesting that the Ötzi died elsewhere on the mountain and that normal environmental changes gradually moved his remains down into the gully. Further, for the first 1,500 years after his death, Ötzi's remains likely thawed and refroze at least once and quite possibly several times. That means it's much more likely that another ice mummy will be discovered, since no extraordinary circumstances are required to explain Ötzi's preservation.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have spent the last 30 years studying the wealth of information about Copper Age life that Ötzi brought with him into the present. Studies have examined his genome, skeleton, last meals, tattoos, and the microbes that lived in his gut. For instance, in 2016, scientists <a href="http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1038/srep31279">used DNA sequencing</a> to identify how Ötzi's clothing was made and found that most of it was made from domesticated cattle, goats, and sheep, although his hat was made from brown bear hide and his quiver from a wild roe deer.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1897727#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1897727&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Scandal has reached a full boil at America's Frontline Doctors—the right-wing pseudo-medical group notorious for peddling bogus COVID-19 treatments and fear-mongering over vaccines and other safe, effective health measures.</p>
<p>The scandal has split the group—aka AFLDS—into warring factions, with its prominent founder, Simone Gold, accused of a slew of wrongdoing, including using the charity group's funds to buy a $3.6 million mansion for herself and her boyfriend. She's also accused of staging a hostile coup of the organization in the weeks since her release from federal prison for her role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, which the group has <a href="https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/about-us/press-releases/aflds-statement">defended</a>.</p>
<p>The coup has left employees locked out of email accounts and other resources, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.407550/gov.uscourts.flmd.407550.1.0.pdf">a lawsuit</a> filed by AFLDS against Gold on November 4. The lawsuit also claims Gold seized control of the group's bank accounts, which reportedly contain at least $7.3 million. For now, it appears Gold also has control over the AFLDS website, which has been pumping out fawning and indignant press releases on her behalf. It's in an extraordinarily sordid state, even for the ignoble group.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898062#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898062&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

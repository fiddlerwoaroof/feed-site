(credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://posts.decontextualize.com/pocket-sp/\">Allison Parrish</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Earlier this month, a programmer and hobbyist named Allison Parrish debuted a <a href=\"https://posts.decontextualize.com/pocket-sp/\">compact hack</a> of the 1996 Nintendo <a href=\"https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Pocket\">Game Boy Pocket</a> handheld game console. Taking inspiration from the later Game Boy Advance SP, she fabricated a custom plastic shell with a hinge so the older monochrome Game Boy can fold shut. She calls it the Game Boy Pocket SP.</p>\n\n<p>In Parrish's extensive write-up of the mod, she explains that her hack began as something of a joke. The Game Boy <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/04/how-to-make-your-old-game-boy-as-good-as-or-better-than-new/\">modding community</a> is popular right now, and one currently trending mod involves transplanting the circuitry of a folding Game Boy Advance SP (from 2003) into a <a href=\"https://www.boxypixel.com/collections/game-boy-advance-sp/products/game-boy-advance-sp-unhinged\">non-folding custom shell</a>. So she thought, &quot;If y'all can take the hinge out of an SP, why can't I add a hinge to a Game Boy that never had one?&quot;</p>\n<p>Parrish, who is an assistant arts professor at NYU, built her complex folding mod over the summer using tools at her university department's <a href=\"https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp\">ITP/IMA shop</a> and the NYU Makerspace. Its unique clamshell design comes courtesy of a Game Boy Pocket motherboard she cut in half, along with custom-design flex PCBs (printed circuit boards) that route signals between the two folding halves. To pull it all together, Parrish designed a <a href=\"https://github.com/aparrish/pocket-sp/\">3D-printed plastic shell</a> using FreeCAD.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898074#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898074&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

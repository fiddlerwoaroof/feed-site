She's also accused of staging a hostile coup of the organization in the weeks since her release from federal prison for her role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, which the group has <a href=\"https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/about-us/press-releases/aflds-statement\">defended</a>.</p>\n<p>The coup has left employees locked out of email accounts and other resources, according to <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.407550/gov.uscourts.flmd.407550.1.0.pdf\">a lawsuit</a> filed by AFLDS against Gold on November 4. The lawsuit also claims Gold seized control of the group's bank accounts, which reportedly contain at least $7.3 million. For now, it appears Gold also has control over the AFLDS website, which has been pumping out fawning and indignant press releases on her behalf. It's in an extraordinarily sordid state, even for the ignoble group.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898062#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898062&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

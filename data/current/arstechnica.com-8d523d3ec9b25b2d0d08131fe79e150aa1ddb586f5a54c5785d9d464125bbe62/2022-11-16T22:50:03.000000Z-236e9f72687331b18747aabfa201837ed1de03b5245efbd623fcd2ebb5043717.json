But the YouTubers at the Gamers Nexus channel have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig2px7ofKhQ\">conducting their own in-depth research</a>, and in short, they believe that the problems are mostly being caused by improperly seated power connectors. &quot;Foreign-object debris&quot; inside the connector can also cause problems, but Gamers Nexus believes this kind of damage is much rarer.</p>\n<p>The failure that Gamers Nexus was able to re-create in its labs involved connecting the 12VHPWR power connector to an RTX 4090 without inserting it fully and then bending the cable to one side, making the connection even worse. After just a few minutes of testing, the loose connection's high power resistance generated heat above 250Â° Celsius, causing smoke and visible bubbling as the connector melted in its socket.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898349#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1898349&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"

  "content":"<p> <b>Misty Moon</b></p><p>The moon peeks through my window,<br>sweet and flirty-shy,<br>swinging like an angel<br>in a warm and humid sky,<br>halo all around it<br>like a temple-presence deep,<br>the mist of holy ages<br>and dreams that never sleep.</p><p>Bear you any message,<br>O moon in cloudy-shadowed skies?<br>Yea, O mortal hero:<br>What waxes, wanes and dies.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Argos</b></p><p>A puppy he was, two decades past;<br>hardly had he known his master's gentle hand.<br>He had passed his hunting years, his solar days,<br>long ago by a dog's count, and was old and tired,<br>and, no master to care for him in his age, abandoned,<br>weak and tick-infested, as untended, unloved dogs are.</p><p>He lay by the door and endured the time till death.</p><p>But once a scent familiar tickled his nose;<br>once a stranger who was not a stranger passed by.<br></p><p>Two paired eyes met and knew each other,<br>dog and man, both no more like themselves,<br>both changed by years, as years only can change.</p><p>The ears dropped. </p><p>The tail wagged a thump.</p><p>The legs struggled to raise the old body,<br>but soon gave up, for lack of a pup's strength.</p><p>Then Argos passed into darkness, one last sigh,<br>fulfilling his faithful fate with a dog's faith.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Starry Sky</b></p><p>The world that shines<br>within my eye<br>is bright;<br>it gleams and glows<br>like flakes of snow<br>to sight<br>in twinkled stars,<br>those angel-hearts,<br>tonight.<br><br></p>"

I think MacIntyre has more resources for addressing the issue than Manent's summary suggests, but the MacIntyreans who are criticizing it are often glossing over the important (and, I think, deliberate) ways in which MacIntyre certainly is an 'Aristotelianism of the opposition' in contrast to what we find in Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas.</p><p>* Alice MacLachlan, <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/rec/MACFDA-3\">Fiduciary Duties and the Ethics of Public Apology</a> (PDF)</p><p>* Daniel McCarthy, <a href=\"https://chroniclesmagazine.org/featured/remembering-michael-oakeshott/\">Remembering Michael Oakeshott</a></p><p>* James Mumford, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/are-human-rights-merely-matter-perception-opinion-1753923\">Are Human Rights Merely a Matter of Perception?</a></p><p>* Ed Lamb, <a href=\"https://antigonejournal.com/2022/11/civil-disobedience-socrates-crito/\">Civil Disobedience: A Puzzle in Plato's Crito</a>, at &quot;Antigone&quot;</p><p>* James Franklin, <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/rec/FRARLP\">Resurrecting logical probability</a> (PDF)</p><p>* Oliver D. Crisp, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/scottish-journal-of-theology/article/infant-baptism-and-the-disposition-to-saving-faith/924A23BEC21F97B81C5071E8DA65F290\">Infant baptism and the disposition to saving faith</a>, on the Reformed theology of infant baptism; this was a very interesting paper.</p><p>* Huaping Lu-Adler, <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/rec/LUAKOL-3\">Kant on Language and the (Self-)Development of Reason</a> (PDF)</p><p>* Jonas Faria Costa, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy/article/on-gregariousness/61DE330CB037355D41BA2939BA029766\">On Gregariousness</a>, looks at human sociality in contexts in which we are not directly interacting, like at a coffee shop to which one might go to be around people, but in which one mostly does one's own thing. As the author notes, this is not considered very often, and most accounts of human sociality don't really shed any light on it.</p><p>* Jonathan Simon and Colin Marshall, <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0004.029/--mendelssohn-kant-and-the-mereotopology-of-immortality?rgn=main;view=fulltext\">Mendelssohn, Kant, and the Mereotopology of Immortality</a></p><p>* Giulia Martina, <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/rec/MARHWT\">How we talk about smells</a> (PDF)</p>"

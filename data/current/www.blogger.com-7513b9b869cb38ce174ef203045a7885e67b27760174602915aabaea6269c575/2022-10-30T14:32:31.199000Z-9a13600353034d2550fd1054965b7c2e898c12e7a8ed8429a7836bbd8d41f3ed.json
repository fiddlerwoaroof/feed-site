  "content":"<p></p><blockquote><p><b>Hymn in Contemplation of Sudden Death<br>by Dorothy Sayers </b></p><p>Lord , if this night my journey end, <br>I thank Thee first for many a friend, <br>The sturdy and unquestioned piers <br>That run beneath my bridge of years. </p><p> And next, for all the love I gave <br>To things and men this side the grave, <br>Wisely or not, since I can prove <br>There always is much good in love. </p><p> Next, for the power thou gavest me <br>To view the whole world mirthfully, <br>For laughter, paraclete of pain, <br>Like April suns across the rain. </p><p> Also that, being not too wise <br>To do things foolish in men's eyes, <br>I gained experience by this, <br>And saw life somewhat as it is. </p><p> Next, for the joy of labour done <br>And burdens shouldered in the sun; <br>Nor less, for shame of labour lost, <br>And meekness born of a barren boast. </p><p> For every fair and useless thing <br>That bids men pause from labouring <br>To look and find the larkspur blue <br>And marigolds of a different hue; </p><p> For eyes to see and ears to hear, <br>For tongue to speak and thews to bear, <br>For hands to handle, feet to go, <br>For life, I give Thee thanks also. </p><p> For all things merry, quaint and strange, <br>For sound and silence, strength, and change, <br>And last, for death, which only gives <br>Value to every thing that lives; </p><p>For these, good Lord that madest me, <br>I praise Thy name; since, verily, <br>I of my joy have had no dearth <br>Though this night were my last on earth.</p></blockquote><p></p>"

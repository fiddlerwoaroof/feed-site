  "content":"<p> <b>Knowing</b></p><p>The world flows in, I ball it up,<br>I bounce it here and there;<br>I play with it like string and cup<br>and toss it in the air.</p><p>The world flows in, I shape it so,<br>I build with it like clay,<br>and then I outward let it flow,<br>returned to light of day.</p><p><br></p><p><b>The Words of Ameny</b></p><p>The collected words, the gathered verses,<br>the heart-searching utterances <br>of the priest of Elephantopolis,<br>Ameny son of Ankhu:<br></p><p>The realm is destroyed and none care;<br>none weep the end, nor do any speak it.<br>None are free from evildoing, no, not one;<br>all do it and all suffer it.<br>Some are learned enough to understand it;<br>none are roused enough to speak against it.<br>Everyone only loves their own utterances;<br>crooked of heart, all honest speech is abandoned.<br>Each mouth says only, &quot;I want.&quot;<br>What past ages built is torn and ruined;<br>rebuke is answered with knife in the belly.<br></p><p>May Thoth, the god-appeaser, vindicate me;<br>may Khonsu, who reckons Truth, favor me;<br>may Irdes in the holy place defend me!<br>As for men, their hearts are selfish;<br>as for men, their hearts are unsteady.</p><p>The brother is unveiled as an enemy;<br>to find an honest man, one must find a stranger.<br>Every face is set against every face.<br>Evil roams the land; no end can be found to it.<br>Where is found recover for the sick?<br>Where is found wind for the sail?<br>Where is found homecoming after long journey?<br>Where is found the land where men are living gods?<br>Seek out the answer, even if you weep;<br>life is transitory, but the wise seek what endures.</p>"

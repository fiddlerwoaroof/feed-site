  "content":"<p><b>Cathedral of Immerath</b></p><p>Sorrow, mortal children, cast the dust of time upon your head;<br>all your fairest works are crumbled; soon they will be dead;<br>this soldier-building, wounded once by guns of blood and death,<br>was left unheeded, unregarded, rasping in its breath;<br>unloved and lonely veteran, it kept the watch of years<br>where its ancestors broke the ground; it fought the things of fear.<br>But God and holy Lambert's way no longer find respect,<br>for Mammon is this age's god, and all things does direct.<br>So strip the village! Strip the church! And strip the very earth!<br>Those things a people will destroy will measure their unworth.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Now</b></p><p>The future is out of reach; the present now<br>is running swiftly past; hope is now<br>as memory, however cut and shaped, is now,<br>and both are running swiftly past; so now<br>be patient with the day; for only now<br>are you and I here, and we know no fate but now,<br>when we are as we are before God's eternal now.</p>"

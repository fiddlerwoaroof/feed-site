E.g.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n<pre>TransferTest {\n  a.transfer(b,50);\n  a.shouldEqual(50);\n  b.shouldEqual(150); // never reached?\n}</pre>\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<footer><cite><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshuamck/status/1572232484884217864\">Josh McK</a></cite></footer>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tMost standard assertion libraries work by throwing exceptions when an assertion fails. Once you throw an exception, remaining code doesn't execute. This means that you only get the first assertion message. Further assertions are not evaluated.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tJosh McKinney <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshuamck/status/1572528796125003777\">later gave more details about a particular scenario</a>. Although in the general case I don't consider the short-circuiting nature of assertions to be a problem, I grant that there are cases where proper assertion composition would be useful.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tLucas DiCioccio's suggestion seems worthy of investigation.\n\t</p>\n\t<h3 id=\"54fc71d7459d4251a79dc16f58bd79b3\">\n\t\tOngoing exploration <a href=\"#54fc71d7459d4251a79dc16f58bd79b3\" title=\"permalink\">#</a>\n\t</h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/1572282314402721805\">I asked</a> Lucas DiCioccio whether he'd done any work with his idea, and the day after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucasdicioccio/status/1572639255582867456\">he replied</a> with a <a href=\"https://www.haskell.org\">Haskell</a> proof of concept.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI found the idea so interesting that I also wanted to carry out a few proofs of concept myself, perhaps within a more realistic setting.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs I'm writing this, I've reached some preliminary conclusions, but I'm also aware that they may not hold in more general cases. I'm posting what I have so far, but you should expect this exploration to evolve over time. If I find out more, I'll update this post with more articles.\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>An initial proof of concept of applicative assertions in C#</li>\n\t\t<li>Error-accumulating composable assertions in C#</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<p>\n\t\tA preliminary summary is in order. Based on the first two articles, applicative assertions look like overkill. I think, however, that it's because of the degenerate nature of the example. Some assertions are essentially one-stop verifications: Evaluate a predicate, and throw an exception if the result is <em>false</em>. These assertions return <a href=\"/2018/01/15/unit-isomorphisms\">unit or void</a>. Examples from <a href=\"https://xunit.net/\">xUnit</a> include <code>Assert.Equal</code>, <code>Assert.True</code>, <code>Assert.False</code>, <code>Assert.All</code>, and <code>Assert.DoesNotContain</code>.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThese are the kinds of assertions that the initial two articles explore.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThere are other kinds of assertions that return a value in case of success. xUnit.net examples include <code>Assert.Throws</code>, <code>Assert.Single</code>, <code>Assert.IsAssignableFrom</code>, and some overloads of <code>Assert.Contains</code>. <code>Assert.Single</code>, for example, verifies that a collection contains only a single element. While it throws an exception if the collection is either empty or has more than one element, in the success case it returns the single value. This can be useful if you want to add more assertions based on that value.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI haven't experimented with this yet, but as far as can tell, you'll run into the following problem: If you make such an assertion return an <a href=\"/2018/10/01/applicative-functors\">applicative functor</a>, you'll need some way to handle the success case. Combining it with another assertion-producing function, such as <code>a -&gt; Asserted e b</code> (pseudocode) is possible with <a href=\"/2018/03/22/functors\">functor</a> mapping, but will leave you with a nested functor.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tYou'll probably want to flatten the nested functor, which is exactly what <a href=\"/2022/03/28/monads\">monads</a> do. Monads, on the other hand, short circuit, so you don't want to make your applicative assertion type a monad. Instead, you'll need to use an isomorphic monad container (<a href=\"/2022/05/09/an-either-monad\">Either</a> should do) to move in and out of. Doable, but is the complexity warranted?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI realise that the above musings are abstract, and that I really should show rather than tell. I'll add some more content here if I ever collect something worthy of an article. if you ask me now, though, I consider that a bit of a toss-up.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe first two examples also suffer from being written in C#, which doesn't have good syntactic support for applicative functors. Perhaps I'll add some articles that use <a href=\"https://fsharp.org/\">F#</a> or Haskell.\n\t</p>\n\t<h3 id=\"676b3bf45f0841bc9a51d3510d917a6a\">\n\t\tConclusion <a href=\"#676b3bf45f0841bc9a51d3510d917a6a\" title=\"permalink\">#</a>\n\t</h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThere's the occasional need for composable assertions. You can achieve that with an applicative functor, but the question is whether it's warranted. Could you make something simpler based on the <a href=\"/2022/04/19/the-list-monad\">list monad</a>?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs I'm writing this, I don't consider that question settled. Even so, you may want to read on.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Next:</strong> An initial proof of concept of applicative assertions in C#.\n\t</p>\n</div><hr>\n   \t\tThis blog is totally free, but if you like it, please consider <a href=\"https://blog.ploeh.dk/support\">supporting it</a>."

  "content":"<p>A famous postliberal has summed up some of the main views of both right- (classical) liberals and progressive liberals in this bracing passage, drawn from his most magisterial work. Observing the rampant decay and corruption of his late-imperial political order, he stated that those who celebrate  immorality as a positive good “are utterly unconcerned about the utter corruption of their country.” In this passage, our author summarizes the views of his society’s elites by adopting their own words and positions, ones that celebrate the regnant depravity:</p><blockquote><p>“So long as our country lasts,” they say, “so long as it <a href=\"https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2020/03/60593/\">enjoys</a> <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/articles/a-vision-for-prosperity/\">material</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W3Seg0JE1PM\">prosperity</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/articles/unrivaled-why-america-will-remain-the-worlds-sole-superpower/\">the</a> <a href=\"https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/leadership/why-america-must-lead.html\">glory</a> of victorious <a href=\"https://time.com/6152096/us-support-ukraine-china-priority/\">war</a>, or better, the security of peace, why should we worry? What concerns us is that we should get <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/our-politics-should-prioritise-economic-growth-over-redistribution\">richer</a> all the time, to have enough extravagant spending every day. . . . It is all right if the poor serve the rich, so long as [they] get enough to eat and enjoy a lazy life under their patronage . . . ; if no one <a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/yes-taxation-theft\">imposes</a> <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/mandatory-voting-bad-unconstitutional-idea\">disagreeable</a> <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/01/09/young-americans-are-right-to-fear-a-renewed-draft/\">duties</a>, or forbids <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/01/04/the-broader-meaning-of-the-trad-cons-new-war-on-porn/\">perverted</a> delights; if rulers are interested not in the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2022/09/14/i-have-my-own-life-the-case-for-legalizing-sex-work/\">morality</a> but the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan\">docility</a> of their subjects; if other nations are under rulers who are regarded not as directors of conduct but as controllers of material things and providers of material satisfactions, and are treated with <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/09/15/european-parliament-ups-pressure-action-hungary\">servile</a> <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2022/09/24/europe-italy-eu-vonderleyen\">fear</a> instead of sincere respect.

Having just finished reading sizable selections of the work with a bright group of undergraduate students at Notre Dame, it was this passage that caused perhaps the most intense buzzing in our class, with students immediately perceiving the uncanny similarity between contemporary defenders of Rome’s corrupt regime, and liberal (often Christian liberal) defenders of much the same in contemporary America.  </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Postliberal Order is a reader-supported publication.

Observing the rampant decay and corruption of his late-imperial political order, he stated that those who celebrate  immorality as a positive good &#8220;are utterly unconcerned about the utter corruption of their country.&#8221; In this passage, our author summarizes the views of his society&#8217;s elites by adopting their own words and positions, ones that celebrate the regnant depravity:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;So long as our country lasts,&#8221; they say, &#8220;so long as it <a href="https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2020/03/60593/">enjoys</a> <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/a-vision-for-prosperity/">material</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/W3Seg0JE1PM">prosperity</a>, and <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/unrivaled-why-america-will-remain-the-worlds-sole-superpower/">the</a> <a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/leadership/why-america-must-lead.html">glory</a> of victorious <a href="https://time.com/6152096/us-support-ukraine-china-priority/">war</a>, or better, the security of peace, why should we worry?

Having just finished reading sizable selections of the work with a bright group of undergraduate students at Notre Dame, it was this passage that caused perhaps the most intense buzzing in our class, with students immediately perceiving the uncanny similarity between contemporary defenders of Rome&#8217;s corrupt regime, and liberal (often Christian liberal) defenders of much the same in contemporary America.  </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg" width="230" height="219" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:219,&quot;width&quot;:230,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:22068,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b592c8-50fb-40d9-a36a-83dfaa2c1d69_230x219.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Postliberal Order is a reader-supported publication.

He argued that at the heart of our liberal disorder is a Pelagian lie about marriage which has been disintegrative of the common good, and has left us socially and politically bankrupt. Since society is a family of families, then, we need to establish the conditions for the possibility of a society built upon sacramental marriage. We certainly agree, and we&#8217;re very pleased to publish Professor Hahn&#8217;s full argument here at </em>Postliberal Order. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset image2-full-screen"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_5760,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;full&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:352,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125541,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-fullscreen" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff30b5cd-a6b2-4105-85c3-10509bf17251_640x352.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There could hardly be a less controversial statement in the setting of our conference than this: <em>the family is the cornerstone of a flourishing society</em>. What we mean by &#8220;family&#8221; matters, of course. A society takes its form from the families that make it up, like a fundamental element takes its properties from its distinctive atoms. Our solidarity-starved civilization, for instance, takes its form from families that have been too often fractured beyond recognition.</p><p>A healthy and enduring society, on the other hand, takes its form from a particular kind of family culture&#8212;one where men and women make and keep lifelong covenants which create not just thriving nuclear households, but complex networks of extended families across place and time. If the microscopic structure of our current society is mostly isolated atoms scarcely bonded to others, the structure of a Christian culture, a sacramental society, is a matrix of atoms&#8212;a family of families&#8212;whose intricate interdependency gives society strength and resilience.</p><p>Thus there is no relationship on which society depends more than the bond between husband and wife. This is the first bond, primordial covenant&#8212;the first society&#8212;without which all others <em>disintegrate</em>.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><em><strong>Postliberal Order</strong></em> is a reader-supported publication.

Such a perspective may seem alien to the theologian. But on the assumptions that (1) law has real structure, reflecting the real and divinely created order of things rather than being merely an arbitrary human creation, and (2) agency in all its forms is part of that structure; then (3) it seems not implausible that the juridical order established by God to regulate the relationships among Himself, the temporal power, and the spiritual power may also embody principles of agency. At a minimum, I hope that the lawyer&#8217;s perspective may clear up the distinctions between and among different models of agency that have been implicitly invoked in these debates, as I will shortly explain, and as Gladden Pappin further explains in his contribution here as well.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg" width="709" height="399" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:399,&quot;width&quot;:709,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:88361,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f665603-102d-457d-9a14-ef936edfb490_709x399.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>The church of Saint-Germain-l&#8217;Auxerrois pictured, on the right, adjacent to the district town hall of Paris&#8217;s first arrondissement.</em></figcaption></figure></div>

Yeah, right!</em> When we answer that the goals of good government are abundance, peace and justice&#8212;to be found in good family policy and common good jurisprudence&#8212;a subsequent reply is sometimes heard: <em>That&#8217;s it? That seems so normal?</em></p><p>The expectation created by postliberalism&#8217;s critics is that, by seeking policies from outside liberalism, postliberals must be secretly committed to some kind of dark, neo-medieval revival. With their mundane policy suggestions, are postliberals indicating that their real goals are unattainable? Far from it. The reality is that normal governance is seemingly so far removed from Western politics that we have forgotten how normal and familiar it should be.</p><p>So let&#8217;s consider the latest form of this observation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/opinion/condition-of-liberalism.html">from Ross Douthat at the </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/opinion/condition-of-liberalism.html">New York Times</a></em>:</p><blockquote><p>The most thoughtful forms of postliberalism, meanwhile, tend to offer sweeping <em>philosophical</em> critiques that cash out in <em>policies</em> that are actually relatively familiar&#8212;the recent postliberal conference at the Franciscan University of Steubenville, for instance, was dismissed by Jonah Goldberg as a gathering of &#8220;pro-life New Dealers,&#8221; and the organizer, Sohrab Ahmari, then quite reasonably embraced the label. Could such a politics overthrow <em>neo</em>liberalism or defeat <em>secular</em> liberalism?</p></blockquote><p>Douthat seems to think that &#8220;familiar&#8221; policies can float free in the world&#8212;that a good policy can fly without too much worry about its surroundings. Everyone knows this is false. Midcentury feminists, for example, critiqued traditional society in order to bring about a world radically free from classical expectations around marriage and family&#8212;a world now all too familiar to us in its pedestrian forms of hookup culture and divorce. Unlike them, postliberals use philosophical critique of liberalism in order to restore the context necessary for good policies to thrive&#8212;and for politics to return to normalcy.</p><p>Adopting policies <em>for the right reasons and on the right grounds</em> matters just as much as the raw &#8220;content&#8221; of the policies. Law is a teacher, and the justification for the policy is often what does the teaching. From the preludes presented in Plato&#8217;s <em>Laws</em>, to the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution, to the &#8220;whereas&#8221; clauses prefacing U.S. legislation, the moral or intellectual infrastructure of policy situates it within a larger whole. Joining theory and practice for the common good is precisely what&#8217;s needed to create the best conditions for having a normal political life.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg" width="1200" height="674.6059544658494" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:642,&quot;width&quot;:1142,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:350868,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-large" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd117dad7-072e-429b-b6ff-1872293d563d_1142x642.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Ross&#8217;s comment drew a <a href="https://twitter.com/SohrabAhmari/status/1583490353612496897">reply from Sohrab Ahmari</a>, who organized the conference in question:</p><blockquote><p>@DouthatNYT makes a point I&#8217;ve heard going back to the early French debates&#8212;that our [the post-liberals&#8217;] philosophical or theological claims are dramatic, but that (at its best) the movement cashes out as a reasonable and sometimes-familiar policy mix, e.g., pro-union, etc.</p><p>But it&#8217;s telling that that eminently reasonable policy mix&#8212;pro-family, pro-labor&#8212;is so familiar, yet so hard to attain under liberalism, especially in its neoliberal iteration.

Catholicism has always envisioned a hierarchy of orders in which the spiritual lies above the temporal power, yet with these powers united or correlated as parts of an integral whole. This vision inspires everything from the Church&#8217;s universal concern for the poor&#8212;everywhere&#8212;to its attention to the common good in jurisprudence and the economy, to its participation in global institutions, to its sacramental life.</p><p>The liberal vision is predicated upon the inversion of this ordering principle, reducing the scope of the temporal while essentially spiritualizing the Church and making it dependent on and subject to the favors of princes, who are the sole agents of all coercive and convening power. The liberal inversion of the relationship between two distinct orders had the effect of an unhappy separation which has led to great political suffering and spiritual decline.</p><p>That&#8217;s how we view the matter, but not everyone agrees. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm8FGGq7838">In his inaugural lecture</a> for the Catholic University of America&#8217;s Institute for Human Ecology, the distinguished scholar of Catholic social teaching, Russell Hittinger, asserts in conclusory fashion that &#8220;separation&#8221; is the operative Catholic principle and best term for understanding the Church&#8217;s relationship to civil governments. To claim the &#8220;separationism&#8221; that we would consider a first-order principle of liberalism is actually the first-order principle of Catholicism is indeed bold. But is it true?</p><p>Hittinger roots his argument principally in Christ&#8217;s words that his kingdom is not of this world, and he claims the authority of St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas and Pope Leo XIII. But we think he fails to demonstrate that any of these authorities support his thesis.</p><p>Hittinger is wrong because he has integralism exactly backwards. Integralism does not fuse the Church and the state. The Church affirms that there are two powers, not one. We therefore conclude that his argument has not been made&#8212;that his thesis is fundamentally misguided, out of touch with Catholic theology, jurisprudence, and the realities of being the leaven that pervades the world.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg" width="1200" height="675.2221125370188" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:570,&quot;width&quot;:1013,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:249014,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-large" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde439dce-3608-4884-87bd-0303b52dc727_1013x570.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h2><strong>I. Pope Leo XIII, Separationist?</strong></h2><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Rm8FGGq7838?t=892">Professor Hittinger states</a>, as his main claim, that, &#8220;The proper term for the relationship between the kingdom here below and the temporal state is <em>separate</em> or <em>separated</em>.&#8221; By separate or separated here, Hittinger means to evoke not U.S. constitutional discussions but the sense of the holy or sacred&#8212;that what is sacred has been set apart to a particular use, in this case a divine use. So far, so eschatological: our Lord asked, &#8220;Think you that I came to give peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but separation&#8221; (Luke 12:51).</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Hittinger&#8217;s argument relies, to a surprising degree, on the connotations of the words <em>separate/separated </em>and, to a lesser extent, <em>integral</em>. &#8220;If we start with the notion of integral as a first premise,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we&#8217;re almost bound to make mistakes.&#8221; (We will return to this point later.) Admittedly, from a rhetorical standpoint it does seem strange to us to pick the very word which liberal writers have often (though not exclusively) used to describe the relationship between church and state. Likewise, it is an unusual move to triangulate the discussion first around the words rather than first around the underlying realities&#8212;the Church and temporal power&#8212;that they describe.</p><p>Be that as it may, Hittinger leans in on this point and describes himself as a &#8220;separationist,&#8221; which he describes not as a slogan but &#8220;a principle learned from St. Thomas and St. Augustine, who learned it by studying the New Testament.&#8221; In the second part of this essay we will assess whether &#8220;separationism&#8221; can be said to be a first-order principle in St. Augustine&#8217;s treatment of the Church&#8217;s relation to temporal power in his <em>City of God</em>, as Hittinger claims. But we must first treat what Hittinger treats first, and at greatest length: Pope Leo XIII. </p><p>Founding his thesis on an extended reflection on Leo XIII&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10011890_sapientiae-christianae.html">Sapientiae christianae</a> </em>(1890), Hittinger begins by calling to mind the fluctuation of political things that was evident throughout the nineteenth century and certainly in the tumultuous years overseen by Pope Leo.</p><p>In this context, Hittinger introduces an overall thesis:</p><blockquote><p>For his part, Leo XIII insisted, &#8220;It cannot be doubted under safeguard of the faith that the governance of souls [<em>regimen animorum</em>] was committed to the Church alone, in such wise that powers of the political order have no share whatsoever in it.&#8221; To have no share whatever is precisely what I mean by separation. In making sense of Church and the world, including the political powers, separation is a first-order term because it describes what&#8217;s essential to the kingdom. Being set apart, having a supernatural end, as well as supernatural capacities for achieving that end.</p></blockquote><p>Hittinger here quotes <em>Sapientiae christianae</em> sec. 27 to articulate what Hittinger calls separation: the <em>regimen animorum </em>belongs exclusively to the Church, which has &#8220;supernatural capacities&#8221; through which it can lead men to this end. With this argument, Hittinger claims that we can neatly place the temporal power, with its need for coercion and punishment, on one side, and we can place the Church, with its baptized members, on the other.</p><p>Yet a key element of Leonine thought appears to have slipped by Hittinger. In the same encyclical, Pope Leo does not limit the Church&#8217;s care of souls to those of the baptized; the Church has the <em>regimen animorum </em>as such. The members of the ecclesia are, as the word indicates, &#8220;called forth&#8221; from the world&#8212;but the body to which they are called invites them to baptism because of its universal concern for all souls. Because the <em>regimen animorum </em>belongs exclusively to the Church, Leo makes clear that <em>its power is intended to suffuse public life</em>. The Church uniquely guides the life of the soul. Even if it primarily chooses to exercise coercive power over its baptized members, its care of the soul includes all spiritual matters&#8212;e.g., any matrimonial claims that come before its courts. As the Code of Canon Law states: &#8220;It belongs to the Church . . . to render judgment concerning any human affairs insofar as . . . the salvation of souls requires it&#8221; (747.2).</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Pope Leo does not limit the Church&#8217;s care of souls to those of the baptized; the Church has the <em>regimen animorum </em>as such.</p></div><p>Observe how Leo&#8217;s own argument, immediately following the text quoted by Hittinger, <em>diverges</em> from Hittinger&#8217;s. The separateness of the Church, as it were, does not hold it back from the temporal world but is the very basis on which it &#8220;pervades&#8221; public life.</p><blockquote><p>The Church alike and the State, doubtless, both possess individual sovereignty (<em>suum habet utraque principatum</em>); hence, in the carrying out of public affairs, neither obeys the other within the limits to which each is restricted by its constitution. It does not hence follow, however, that Church and State are in any manner severed (<em>nulla ratione disiunctas esse sequitur</em>), and still less antagonistic. . . . From God has the duty been assigned to the Church not only to interpose resistance, if at any time the State rule should run counter to religion, but, further, to make a strong endeavor that the power of the Gospel may pervade the law and institutions of the nations (<em>studioseque conari, ut in leges et instituta populorum virtus pervadat Evangelii</em>).</p></blockquote><p>Pervading &#8220;the law and institutions of the nations&#8221; does not sound like &#8220;separationism.&#8221; Indeed, in a 2007 contribution to a work on Catholic social teaching, Hittinger himself called Pope Leo an &#8220;antiseparationist.&#8221;&#185; It is certainly true that the Church is a kingdom which has <em>principatus</em> or sovereignty over itself; due to its supernatural capacities, it has a certain proper function <em>separated</em>, because sacred, from temporal oversight. Leo acknowledges this when he affirms the sovereignty of the Church and the civil commonwealth, but Leo rejects any inference that they are to be <em>disjunctae</em> or disjointed.</p><p>The immediate context of <em>Sapientiae christianae </em>confirms this view. Leo&#8217;s <em>Immortale Dei </em>of 1885 lays out his precise understanding of the Church&#8217;s universal scope and jurisdiction. Here too, instead of quoting Leo&#8217;s words that God &#8220;who is the author of these two powers, has marked out the course of each in right correlation to the other&#8221; (sec. 13), Hittinger makes Leo&#8217;s exclusive concern appear to be laissez-faire.</p><p>If Hittinger follows Leo XIII as closely as he claims, then we would expect him to, at a minimum, take the Church&#8217;s supernatural &#8220;separated&#8221; nature to entail not &#8220;separationism&#8221; but a holy obligation, on the basis of its care of all souls, to pervade civil institutions with the power of the Gospel. This is, indeed, what Hittinger has argued for in the past&#8212;and we are puzzled as to why he has shifted from &#8220;antiseparationism&#8221; to &#8220;separationism&#8221; at this late stage of his career. But we believe that while he is wrong now, he was correct in 2007: the Leonine &#8220;concord,&#8221; on the basis of mutual, ordered relations between two distinct powers, each with sovereignty, is what we mean by integralism. Perhaps it is possible for Hittinger to be a separationist and an antiseparationist at the same time, and in the same way. But we think he owes us an explanation for what looks like a dramatic reversal in his interpretation of Leonine teaching, moving away from the obvious to the more obscure, spiritualized, and detached interpretation.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Pervading &#8220;the law and institutions of the nations&#8221; does not sound like &#8220;separationism.&#8221; In a 2007 essay, Hittinger himself called Pope Leo an &#8220;antiseparationist.&#8221;</p></div><p>This more obvious interpretation of Leo&#8217;s thought is not held only by integralists. In a 1953 article for <em>Theological Studies </em>entitled &#8220;<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/004056395301400201">Leo XIII: Separation of Church and State</a>,&#8221; even John Courtney Murray, SJ, admitted that Leo envisioned close cooperation of Church and state, on the basis of the Church&#8217;s competencies as well as the natural virtue of religion. &#8220;If sheer repetition of the word means anything,&#8221; wrote Murray, &#8220;one must say that Leo XIII&#8217;s overwhelming emphasis was on <em>concordia</em>&#8212;harmony between the two powers, harmony between the two societies. The word strikes literally the keynote of his pontificate&#8221; (p. 209). For Pope Leo, and the tradition he safeguards, <em>concordia</em> is the first-order principle for relating the two powers. Perhaps <em>concordia </em>would have been a better prompt for Hittinger, as well&#8212;who previously cited this same 1953 article of Murray&#8217;s in his own work.&#178;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg" width="1200" height="782.2222222222222" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:392421,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-large" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae8fa849-4b11-4ab5-8fdb-4273a6061a35_1080x704.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>From &#8220;Separate&#8221; to &#8220;Contrary&#8221;</strong></h3><p>If Hittinger is to explain that the Church is separate unto itself in its mission, he must explain its nature. What character and institutions does the Church have to ensure its separateness in a way which has the proximity to heal and elevate souls, families, nations? Instead, at this juncture, Hittinger takes a fateful turn. &#8220;Separate,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;can mean <em>contradictory</em> or it can mean <em>contrary</em>.&#8221; Insofar as this world exhibits a &#8220;reign of sin and death,&#8221; it is, as Hittinger argues, contradictory to the nature of the Church. It is certainly true that the Church, while full of sinners, stands contrary to sin&#8212;&#8220;a sign which shall be contradicted&#8221; (Luke 2:34)&#8212;and so opposed to the Pauline sense of &#8220;the world&#8221; and &#8220;the way of all flesh.&#8221; Unfortunately, Hittinger means something more than St. Paul did. He means that the Church stands as a contradiction to political life itself, arguing that &#8220;political life,&#8221; even when not &#8220;sinful or death-dealing,&#8221; is &#8220;contrary to, other than the kingdom.&#8221; For Hittinger, Church and political life have no common point of reference or field of view.</p><p>Here we have a grave problem. For while the tradition, which Leo continued, held direct ecclesiastical involvement in partisan squabbles or capital punishment to be <em>contradictory </em>to the Church&#8217;s nature, it is written into the very language of the tradition that terms like <em>society</em>, <em>polity</em>, <em>government</em>, <em>rule</em> and <em>power </em>apply analogically to Church and state precisely because &#8220;two there are&#8221; (<em>Duo sunt</em>). Indeed, the very Leonine lines on which Hittinger bases his argument testify to this: the Church is said to have the <em>regimen animorum </em>or rule over <em>all</em> souls; both Church and state are said to have <em>principatus</em> or principate/sovereignty in themselves. (For more on the problems with Hittinger&#8217;s analysis of the <em>contrary </em>and <em>contradictory </em>elements of political and ecclesiastical life, see Urban Hannon&#8217;s <a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/2022/10/10/correlation-not-contrariety-a-response-to-russell-hittinger/">outstanding discussion at the </a><em><a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/2022/10/10/correlation-not-contrariety-a-response-to-russell-hittinger/">Lamp</a></em>.)</p><p>While Leo accepts that the Church has a <em>regimen animorum </em>separate unto itself (if we are to grant Hittinger&#8217;s term narrowly), it is precisely the nature of this <em>regimen </em>that forbids Leo&#8212;or the tradition&#8212;from ever claiming that &#8220;political life&#8221; is &#8220;contrary to, other than the kingdom.&#8221; If the Church does not have a <em>regimen</em>, if it lacks the ability to govern itself, then it can hardly claim juridical independence from the state. But the essence of the Church&#8217;s being a perfect society is that it is juridically perfect, as well, because it is united to Christ the King, who is the very principle of perfection itself.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>It is written into the very language of the tradition that terms like <em>society</em>, <em>polity</em>, <em>government</em>, <em>rule</em> and <em>power </em>apply analogically to Church and state precisely because &#8220;two there are.&#8221;</p></div><p>For Pope Leo, and the whole tradition he safeguards, the temporal and spiritual powers are polities that, with particular ends, reflect the order of creation. To point out only the most obvious respect, both have legal codes ordering the public life of Church and state toward their respective, related ends. Hittinger ambiguously evades this question by stating that &#8220;the kingdom [i.e., the Church] . . . is not an association that&#8217;s sociologically familiar in the usual sense.&#8221; But he fails to say whether the Church, in spite of being a unique body, has features similar to other kingdoms&#8212;such as public structure, rule, law and coercion. The Church does not cease being human for having been divinely instituted.</p><p>The more Hittinger attempts to draw the contrast, the more the nature of each power becomes confused and vague. &#8220;Politics,&#8221; he says, &#8220;has its foundational principles in morals under natural law, custom, and various species of human law.&#8221; Are these morals encouraged by law, or are they presupposed by law? We do not learn. &#8220;In sharp distinction,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;no person can direct another to the kingdom without presupposing grace.&#8221; Can temporal things be arranged in such a way as to facilitate the life of grace, and can the Church use human means to foster the life of grace? Again, we are not told&#8212;but we are led to believe that the answer is &#8220;No.&#8221;</p><p>Hittinger only describes the Church as having &#8220;supernatural capacities&#8221; for achieving its &#8220;supernatural end.&#8221; But the Church&#8217;s supernatural capacities are not constrained&#8212;the supernatural graces flow in many directions, and the sacraments through which those graces flow also require order and jurisdiction. By conjuring a kind of ultraseparationism, we believe that Hittinger sadly loses his ability to account for the Church&#8217;s actions in the world. The Church becomes a kind of narrow club for the baptized, careful neither to speak to mankind as a whole nor to govern itself in any recognizable way.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><em>Postliberal Order</em> is a reader-supported publication.

In an unguarded moment, Hittinger knocks &#8220;nearly fifteen hundred years&#8221; of Church history for exhibiting what he calls a &#8220;comedy of jurisdictions&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;overlapping interests of civil and ecclesial powers&#8221; that produced constant tensions. Declaring himself in favor of &#8220;separationism,&#8221; however, does nothing to solve classic questions such as whether the state can tax clergy, whether clergy can appeal to the pope against civil sovereigns, or even whether the Church can juridically intervene on behalf of the weak and unfortunate, as St. Augustine did nearly every day of his episcopal career. Indeed, the Church cannot even settle these questions with the temporal power if it is not also understood as an actual, identifiable power on earth as it is in heaven. Finally, the Church&#8217;s constant view was also that its temporal sovereignty, however limited, provided a bulwark against its succumbing to the pressures of other powers&#8212;or to the pressures of the age. All these questions receive elision or glib dismissal by Hittinger.</p><h2><strong>II. St. Augustine on What Integrates Orders</strong></h2><p>Having treated Hittinger&#8217;s counterintuitive interpretation of his Leonine authority, we must now turn to his two other stated authorities, namely Augustine and Aquinas. Hittinger asserts: &#8220;I&#8217;m a separationist. It&#8217;s not a slogan. It&#8217;s a principle learned from St. Thomas and St. Augustine.&#8221; Hittinger advances these authorities, but demonstrates nothing of their thought in support of his specious claim that they, too, are now to be considered separationists.</p><p>One of the first signs that Hittinger is tilting at windmills is his phrase &#8220;pagan integralism.&#8221; It is certainly true, as Fustel de Coulanges shows in his work <em>The Ancient City</em>, that pagan, polytheistic religion pervaded ancient society and political life. But no Christian could ever call the mere pervasiveness of religion &#8220;integralism.&#8221; The problem with paganism is the grave sin of idolatry; the problem with paganism is that it does not integrate, but is actually <em>disintegrative</em> of the good of souls and cities. One could say that<strong>, </strong>as with all false religion, the problem with paganism is that it separates us from God precisely because it fails to unite. After all, gnosticism separates body and soul, Arianism separates humanity and divinity, and liberalism separates human means and divine ends. The problem with paganism is not that it pervades, but that it cannot unite us to our final end. </p><div class="pullquote"><p>The problem with paganism is that it does not integrate, but is actually <em>disintegrative</em> of the good of souls and cities.</p></div><p>This is precisely Augustine&#8217;s argument in his famous masterpiece <em>The City of God</em>, where he presents his vision of &#8220;two cities&#8221; running through history&#8212;one which is &#8220;fugitive,&#8221; fleeing from God, and one which is &#8220;pilgrim,&#8221; an obedient city united to God by the medicinal and elevating graces of Christ. It is the burden of the entire first half of Augustine&#8217;s <em>City of God</em> not to demonstrate that Christianity offers &#8220;separationism&#8221; to the world, but rather that the Church offers the world the &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; of true religion. </p><p>Nevertheless, Hittinger claims that his &#8220;separationism&#8221; is based on a sermon Augustine preached after the sack of Rome, reworked as the first book of <em>The City of God</em>. By beginning with the faulty premise that &#8220;integralism&#8221; is pagan, Hittinger sets himself up for a misreading of Augustine. Hittinger states:</p><blockquote><p>Just when Christians had some political grip on imperial power, Rome itself was shattered. Augustine understood almost right away that this complaint suggests that at least some of his flock had not understood the difference between Christianity and pagan integralism.</p></blockquote><p>Here we see the faulty premise about &#8220;pagan integralism&#8221; at work, misleading us about Augustine&#8217;s argument. The prompt about &#8220;separationism&#8221; requires him to interpret Augustine&#8217;s aim in writing <em>The</em> <em>City of God</em> as a work of pulling &#8220;converts&#8221; away from pagan ideas about the pervasiveness of religion, and correcting their pagan expectation that Christianity would somehow magically make polities happy. But this is a badly distortive and anachronistic lens.</p><p>Augustine opens his famous work by acknowledging that he is writing at the request of a Roman proconsul in North Africa named Marcellinus. This in itself is significant for relating the Church to temporal power since we see here the regular kind of converse and concord between the spiritual authority of a bishop in North Africa, and his temporal counterpart. The very occasion for writing <em>The City of God</em> can be seen as an instance of the temporal power asking the spiritual power for counsel. Hittinger seems to think Augustine is writing to separate Christianity and Rome, but Augustine&#8217;s pastoral and apologetic concern is principally with those graces which would really help Rome face suffering, and rightly order them to the eternal happiness and glory of the one true God.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg" width="1200" height="547.2527472527472" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:664,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:296749,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-large" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45869571-24f9-4529-b80a-5c75c56e8066_1558x710.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Hittinger highlights especially Augustine&#8217;s reflections on how the Visigoths spared the Catholic Church, which was unheard-of in the custom of war (pagan victors always destroyed the civic shrines to demonstrate total dominance). Professor Hittinger neglects to say that &#8220;those basilicas and shrines&#8221; were built by Emperor Constantine in the heart of Rome, just as he neglects to say that Augustine later praises the temporal power for building these basilicas, praising Constantine specifically for not worshipping demons, but &#8220;only the true God&#8221; (5.25). Hittinger roots his separationism, bizarrely, in the very fact that the Catholic Church is at the heart of Rome. One would think this alone would incline him more toward his 2007 commitment to antiseparationism than to his apparent reversal in 2022.</p><p>Augustine raises up a vision of the Church providing not only eternal and spiritual benefits, but material and temporal benefits for all souls, &#8220;both Christian and pagan&#8221; (1.1). From the high altar, where the graces flow from the side of Christ who was once pierced by a Roman spear, Augustine marvels that Romans were now being saved from the cruel savagery of their enemies. Christ sets the Church apart, not for the purpose of separation, but for the salvation of many souls.</p><p>Instead of separation, Augustine is most interested in how Romans suffer: &#8220;What matters is the nature of the sufferer, not the nature of the sufferings&#8221; (1.8). If Hittinger would have pressed a little further into book 1, he would have found a powerful correction to his faulty premise since Augustine goes on to treat three paragons of Roman virtue in order to show how Roman virtue apart from true religion holds up in the face of suffering. The three he treats&#8212;Lucretia, Marcus Regulus and Cato&#8212;are a mixed bag of heroes. Each faced tremendous suffering, and each was praised for their fortitude as heroes who faced suffering with honor. Two died by their own hand (Lucretia and Cato) and Augustine asks, What sort of virtue ends in suicide? But one of these figures is actually an example of the very problem with Hittinger&#8217;s premise regarding &#8220;pagan integralism.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Marcus Regulus was a general who had become famous for his victories over the Carthaginians in the first Punic War. He was a Roman hero. In a subsequent war he was captured and was made to swear an oath to his god that he would return to Carthage if he failed to secure a favorable peace treaty with Rome. Regulus swore an oath to his god, went to Rome, advised the Senate to reject the treaty, and then returned to Carthage to honor his oath and face his death. Perhaps surprisingly, Augustine praises Marcus Regulus as Rome&#8217;s best man, yet he also shows why Rome &#8220;best man&#8221; is bested by Christian martyrs who know &#8220;the excellence of humility.&#8221; </p><p>Regulus was a Roman hero because he united morality and religion. When Augustine praises him, he is really just praising the natural law, acknowledging that religion and morality go together as part of justice. He even praises Regulus&#8217;s worship as &#8220;genuine&#8221; because he regards this as the virtue of natural religion. But if Hittinger had drawn us further in his chosen text, he would have found that the one thing Augustine does not do is think that pagan religion &#8220;integrates&#8221; or rightly orders or unites the Roman soul to God.</p><p>Augustine concludes, as any integralist would, that the problem with Roman virtues is not that they are natural, but that they are united to a false religion, and so the virtues are neither integrated into a whole which can face temporal suffering, nor do they unite us to the highest good, our final end and the cause of our eternal happiness. Contra Hittinger, Augustine favors &#8220;Catholic integralism&#8221; and opposes &#8220;pagan disintegralism.&#8221; He insists not on separation, but on the right kind of unity for the soul and the city&#8212;<em>concordia</em>&#8212;since only true religion unites us to God, and this brings temporal and eternal benefits at every level, for the soul, the family, the polity, in union with the city of God, i.e. the Catholic Church, on pilgrimage in this present life.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Augustine concludes, as any integralist would, that the problem with Roman virtues is not that they are natural, but that they are united to a false religion.</p></div><p>We must conclude that Hittinger&#8217;s claim to Augustine&#8217;s authority, even constrained to his treatment of the first book of <em>The City of God</em>, utterly fails. His view that &#8220;separationism&#8221; has been learned from St Augustine is nowhere demonstrated, and we have shown in some detail how the very text he cites stands firmly against his faulty premises and assertions. There is more to say about Augustine&#8217;s first-order principles, but it&#8217;s a matter of certainty that &#8220;separationism&#8221; is not one of them.</p><p>St. Augustine concludes book one this way: &#8220;While the City of God is on pilgrimage in this world, she has in her midst some who are united with her in her participation in the sacraments, but who will not join with her in the eternal destiny of the saints&#8221; (1.35). While there will be an eschatological separation at the end of time, Augustine envisions not &#8220;separationism&#8221; but the Church as a pervasive presence ordered, structurally and in every way, to the salvation of souls.</p><h2><strong>III. Grace Elevates and Perfects</strong></h2><p>Having excluded the possibility that separationism could be Leonine or Augustinian, we are left with the question of whether it is fundamentally Thomistic, or fundamentally something else.</p><p>Hittinger rests his claim to authority on the Angelic Doctor&#8217;s gloss on John 18 (&#8220;My kingdom is not of this world&#8221;) namely that the kingdom &#8220;does not have its origin in earthly causes and human choice.&#8221; This is undoubtedly true: the Church is a divine gift, born from above. But once again, Hittinger claims something more than he demonstrates. He claims that Aquinas&#8217;s embrace of &#8220;My kingdom is not of this world&#8221; is of &#8220;supreme importance&#8221; for his thesis about separationism.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a reason why we associate Aquinas not with separations but with distinctions that help us to see reality. Aquinas sees reality as a whole because it is all caused by God, and he arrives at a true understanding of the whole precisely through making the correct distinctions. Nothing that exists can be &#8220;contrary&#8221; to God, but everything must be understood in relation to him.&nbsp;</p><p>Aquinas recognizes &#8220;the real distinction&#8221; between Creator and creation, but even this is understood as the relationship between the uncreated cause and the created effects. His understanding of the human person, similarly, is that we are created in God&#8217;s &#8220;image and likeness.&#8221; The human person is a &#8220;microcosm&#8221; which unites heaven and earth in the hylomorphic union of body and soul, and it&#8217;s our very nature as rational and political animals that we &#8220;image&#8221; in creation God&#8217;s government of the universe&#8212;we are analogical creatures. Against Hittinger&#8217;s principle of separationism, Aquinas gives us the principle of analogy (<em>analogia entis</em>) at every level of his thought, from a consideration of how we can know God from the things which have been made (Romans 1:20) to how grace does not destroy nature but perfects it (<em>gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit</em>) to how the Church is like a household or a city. Indeed, the analogical nature of Aquinas&#8217;s thought is so profoundly Catholic that in his own opposition to Catholicism, the Protestant theologian Karl Barth would call the Thomistic &#8220;principle of analogy&#8221; an invention of the Antichrist, indeed the very &#8220;paganization&#8221; of Christianity which Hittinger charges against integralists.&nbsp;</p><p>Like many classical Christian thinkers, Aquinas thought analogically about the natural and supernatural orders, and also about temporal and spiritual jurisdictions within the earthly city. If we consider Aquinas&#8217;s glosses on the New Testament, we could point out comments on Ephesians 2:19&#8212;&#8220;now then you are not strangers and foreigners: but you are citizens of the saints, and the domesticals of God&#8221;&#8212;which analogizes between the Church, the common good of the family, and the political common good. Indeed, Aquinas writes not only that there is an analogy, but that the Church &#8220;contains within it something of the city and something of the home.&#8221;&#179; There is no hint of separationism, only the principle that grace perfects and elevates nature.&nbsp;For the same reason, Aquinas says that God is always the foundation of every spiritual edifice, but that the Church &#8220;is instrumentally constructed&#8221; through men.&#8308;</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Against Hittinger&#8217;s principle of separationism, Aquinas gives us the principle of analogy at every level of his thought, from a consideration of how we can God from the things which have been made, to how the Church is like a household or a city.</p></div><p>Aquinas consistently echoes the parallel between ecclesiastical and civil structures that was commonplace in the tradition in a similar way. &#8220;A congregation of men is twofold,&#8221; he writes in his <em>Sentences</em> commentary, &#8220;namely economic, as those who are of one family; and political, as those who are of people; the Church is similar to a political congregation, because that people is called the Church.&#8221;&#8309; Elsewhere, in his commentary on Psalm 45, Aquinas spoke of the city of God as realizing the perfections of the polity (its unity or liberty, for example) on a higher level.&#8310;</p><p>These are but a few examples that show why separationism is actually foreign to St. Thomas. There is a deeper, metaphysical reason for this&#8212;a reason which liberalism denies. Like Augustine, Aquinas affirmed a metaphysical hierarchy of goods that reached upwards from the primacy of God as uncaused cause to God as final end. The human person was a &#8220;microcosm,&#8221; God&#8217;s chosen crown of creation, made to rule creation in the divine image and likeness, intrinsically ordered to the common good&#8212;in the family and the polity, all the way up through the Church, to God. This is right order, and the integrative key to the whole is right worship.&nbsp;</p><p>For Aquinas, as for Augustine, nothing that exists can be contrary to God. There is no principle of separation in uniting humanity to divinity in creation, nor still in the hypostatic union. What we find in Aquinas is hierarchy and order, reality understood not principally through contraries but distinctions that discern the true unity and order of reality as such. Far from a &#8220;separationism,&#8221; Thomas teaches that the sovereign who orders human laws must contemplate natural law as a determination of God&#8217;s eternal law, and that it is most fitting that the sovereign contemplate the divine law, which is to say the law of divine revelation, in ruling for the common good of the whole. Consider St. Thomas&#8217;s counsel to the king of Cyprus in <em>De regno</em> as a fitting summary:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>It pertains to the king&#8217;s office to promote the good life of the multitude in such a way as to make it suitable for the attainment of heavenly happiness. . . . He should command those things which lead to the happiness of Heaven and, as far as possible, forbid the contrary.</p></blockquote><p>Presumably Professor Hittinger considers such counsel to be &#8220;historically contingent,&#8221; but at some point, he will have to deal with the consistent way in which the Church thinks in terms of <em>concordia</em> more than <em>contrariness</em>. Hittinger has done so in the past, in his work on natural law, on subsidiarity and on the three necessary societies. But now he has been prompted to move in what looks like a new direction, one which at times seems to suggest that politics is something utterly separated from the rest of reality&#8212;sometimes it&#8217;s the thing which &#8220;outlasts,&#8221; but usually the implication of his view of politics shares more in common with the protestant view that the state is a consequence of the Fall, that it has a purely negative, coercive function.&nbsp;</p><p>Aquinas&#8217;s own Aristotelian habit of recognizing that we are political by nature, and that politics as such is not a result of the fall, as some of our separated brethren believe, but instead corresponds to God&#8217;s governance of creation seems absent from Hittinger&#8217;s present trajectory. We think Hittinger&#8217;s forgetfulness of the entire tradition of Catholic teaching in the relation of spiritual and temporal authority here may be explained by the fact that his fundamental principle of &#8220;separationism&#8221; is not Catholic at all.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Concluding that separationism is not a Catholic principle at all leaves us in a quandary. Whence does separationism come? We do not think that Professor Hittinger is a committed Barthian. So where can we turn?</p><div class="pullquote"><p>We think Hittinger&#8217;s forgetfulness of the entire tradition of Catholic teaching in the relation of spiritual and temporal authority here may be explained by the fact that his fundamental principle of &#8220;separationism&#8221; is not Catholic at all.</p></div><p>There is one possible, quite contested source. We recall Lord Acton&#8217;s famous claim that Aquinas can be considered &#8220;the first Whig,&#8221; which is to say the first liberal, and liberalism absolutely follows a principle of separationism. Indeed, to the untutored ear, the very term &#8220;separationism&#8221; sounds so much more strikingly similar to Jeffersonian principles of separation of church and state than it does to Catholicism that it&#8217;s amazing that anyone would find the claim plausible. While we appreciate that Professor Hittinger thinks Americanism is a &#8220;phantom heresy,&#8221; it certainly rhymes with the principle he defends. After all, what does Hittinger think the temporal order can learn from the Church? How to get to heaven? How to rule with humility before God? How to crush the foul altars and worship the one true God? No, Hittinger has a very modest lesson which the temporal power hasn&#8217;t even learned from the GOP in its sixty years of repeating it: &#8220;limited government.&#8221; If the principle of separationism results in counsel as thin as this, who can be blamed for considering the Church to be no seat of wisdom at all?</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Hittinger has a very modest lesson which the temporal power hasn&#8217;t even learned from the GOP in its sixty years of repeating it: &#8220;limited government.&#8221;</p></div><p>In conclusion, we must say No to Professor Hittinger. The works of the Church in this world are many. It invites all mankind to accept the truths of the Gospel and to join Christ&#8217;s body. It supplies them with everything they need to reach the spiritual destiny to which the Lord has called them. Outside its walls, it speaks with the voice of justice and acts with the hand of mercy; its members succor the poor and the weak, and it strives to speak for those, like the unborn, who cannot speak for themselves. The Lord also left it with a structure of governance, hierarchy and order suited to this task. And he left the Church fully equipped, on this basis, to deal with the secular powers&#8212;retreating in defense or stepping forward in confident cooperation, as the times and circumstances proposed it. For all these reasons, the Church has always spoken of concord and harmony as its goals&#8212;preserving and extending the people of God that the Lord has called forth from the world. Whatever words we use to describe this complex reality, let us make sure that we do not deny any parts of it, nor &#8220;separate&#8221; it so far from the world it has been called to serve and to guide.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ol><li><p>Russell Hittinger, &#8220;Pope Leo XIII (1810&#8211;1903),&#8221; in John Witte and Frank Alexander, eds., The Teachings of Modern Roman Catholicism on Law, Politics,* and Human Nature (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007), 62.</p></li><li><p>Hittinger, &#8220;Pope Leo XIII,&#8221; 44.</p></li><li><p><em>Super Epistolam B.

Paul</strong></p><p><em>This article is a lightly edited version of a speech given to the conference &#8220;Restoring a Nation: The Common Good in the American Tradition&#8221; at Franciscan University of Steubenville, Steubenville, Ohio, October 7&#8211;8, 2022.</em></p><p>A popular typology of post&#8211;World War II welfare capitalism exists in the academic literature on political economy. Different national models are defined by the different character and combination of three universal social institutions: the state, the market, and the family. These institutions together form a &#8220;welfare regime&#8221; or, more stylistically, a &#8220;world of welfare capitalism.&#8221; As this popular approach goes, three distinct types exist: the social democratic regime typically represented by Sweden, the conservative regime whose exemplar is Germany and the liberal regime of which the United States is the archetype.</p><p>As a liberal country, the United States has a characteristically &#8220;residual&#8221; welfare state oriented towards the poor. This is so much the case that, among Americans, &#8220;welfare&#8221; is understood not as the aggregate well-being of society&#8212;the sum of social goods that is the common good of a people&#8212;but instead a collection of means-tested government transfer payments such as Medicaid, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In a liberal regime the middle class is not supposed to receive &#8220;welfare&#8221; from the state but should instead secure its well-being privately by means of the market and the family. Thus fundamental elements of social welfare such as health care, childcare, pensions and income in lieu of work should all derive from ones own labor remunerated through the labor market or from one&#8217;s familial attachment to such a worker. The state is meant to step in only at moments of market or family failure, and then to step away as soon as possible.</p><p>We are familiar with the importance of the market in a liberal welfare regime. The state calls the abstract and capacious &#8220;market&#8221; into existence through property and contract law, incorporation and central banking, transportation infrastructure and tax (dis)incentives. Labor markets are particularly important. Work has long been the shared normative fulcrum of the American political economy and <a href="https://compactmag.com/article/the-republic-of-work-isn-t-working">remains so today</a>. One might recall the defining feature of &#8220;welfare reform&#8221; in the 1990s being its strong work incentives.</p><p>We tend to pay far less attention to the family and how much a liberal welfare regime depends on its successful functioning. Even though the family produces less welfare in a postindustrial than an industrial economy, and less welfare in an industrial economy than an agricultural one, even in twenty-first-century America the family remains a fundamental site of the production of welfare services like childcare and education, meal preparation, cleaning, shopping, maintenance and repair, transportation and entertainment. It is also, of course, the preeminent site of welfare consumption for those we call &#8220;dependents&#8221;&#8212;members of society who do not, cannot and/or should not seek their material succor from the market.</p><p>While the liberal state mainly finds the family already in existence and treats it as a spontaneous association of the private sphere, this laissez-faire approach hides a powerful implicit familism. To keep members of society out of poverty and off &#8220;welfare,&#8221; the family is expected to generate welfare even as the state takes little initiative in actively cultivating the ability of the family to perform this central function. The family is also expected to generate essential public goods, as mundane as the funding of Social Security and as profound as the moral education and continuation of the community itself.</p><p>Perhaps once we could reasonably assume that the family would uncomplicatedly reproduce itself, that &#8220;private&#8221; and &#8220;local&#8221; institutions such as churches, neighborhoods and voluntary societies, would perform what support was required to ensure that the family would persist, that it would both produce welfare in the present and the continuation of the society itself into the future. Today, however, the liberal laissez-faire approach to the family is falling woefully short. The evidence has become overwhelming, not only at the bottom of society among those for whom the residual welfare state exists, but throughout all of society. The American family is not merely challenged to produce its customary degree of welfare. It is increasingly beleaguered simply in the process of reproducing itself.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Postliberal Order is a reader-supported publication.

Russia had a brief recession but is already <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/manufacturing-pmi">beginning to recover</a>. Meanwhile, skyrocketing energy prices caused by the war and the sanctions have massively <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/russia-more-than-triples-current-account-surplus-to-167-billion">increased Russia&#8217;s overall wealth</a>. At the same time, Europe faces complete collapse. European reliance on Russian natural gas and other basic inputs, such as fertilizer, has been brutally exposed. Europe now faces permanently higher energy prices and possibly even <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/europe-s-descent-into-deindustrialisation">deindustrialization</a>.</p><p>Many in the West assumed that waging hybrid war on Russia would turn it into an isolated pariah state. Once again, however, the opposite has happened. In the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, China and Russia immediately announced new trade deals. As if that was not enough, a variety of new countries&#8212;including previous Western ally and key oil producer Saudi Arabia&#8212;have <a href="https://unherd.com/thepost/the-new-brics-alliance-is-a-mortal-threat-to-the-west/">lined up to join</a> the Russian- and Chinese-led BRICS alliance. Soon after, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/dollar-dominance-russia-china-rouble-yuan-brics-reserve-currency-imf-2022-6">the BRICS announced</a> that they would be pursuing a new multipolar reserve currency to unseat the U.S. dollar.</p><p>In the twentieth century we learned that large-scale wars restructure the global economy. The First World War spelled the end of the British Empire&#8217;s influence over world trade. The Second World War allowed the United States to ascend to the position previously occupied by Britain. Yet what the Russian intervention in Ukraine is teaching us is that a full-scale global war is not required to achieve these shifts&#8212;a hybrid war waged against a geopolitical rival is more than enough.</p><p>The likely long-term consequence of the Russo-Ukrainian war of 2022 will be the demolition of Europe and the emergence of a rival BRICS+ bloc that will likely be more economically powerful than the United States. There is also a chance that the United States will not weather the demise of Europe well. In the 1930s the European economy collapsed and dragged America down with it, into the depths of the Great Depression. That could easily happen again. Only time will tell.</p><p>But even in this worst-case scenario, the United States will remain a serious global power&#8212;although it will no longer be a unipolar hegemon and it will be unlikely to possess the global reserve currency. If America plays its cards right, it can still wield enormous influence in the new world order that is emerging. It may even be able to help Europe rebuild and form a serious Western economic bloc that can counterbalance the new BRICS+ alliance.</p><p>But there is an elephant in the room. One that threatens to stampede over even this suboptimal outcome. That elephant is called: Taiwan.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><em>Postliberal Order</em> is a reader-supported publication.

I spoke at the Italian Conservatism Conference. There was this huge victory as you mentioned of the conservative coalition led by Giorgia Meloni.<br><br>The Italian people have spoken, and they have elected a solidly conservative government. For decades, left-liberals have had this psyop that history is only moving in one direction, that it&#8217;s only producing more and more liberalism, and when there were conservative governments, we have one here in Hungary, with these conservative governments in central Europe, they could sort of dismiss that and say Hungary has its unique way, but the heart of Europe is not going to go this direction. Italy was a founding member of the European Union, it&#8217;s the third largest economy in Europe. For Italy to swing to the right, the importance of that absolutely cannot be overestimated. <br><br>The liberal ruling classes really didn&#8217;t want people to notice what was going on there. There&#8217;s been a discontented silent majority for a while, that&#8217;s been divided among a number of different conservative parties. But Italy was really hit hard by the migrant crisis in recent years. It&#8217;s really stagnated economically. Salaries haven&#8217;t gone up in about thirty years, something like that. So, there were a lot of elements there to be put together into a conservative victory and that&#8217;s now come about.</p></blockquote><p>Watch this space for further commentary on the Italian election.

The Hungarian Constitution adopted in 2011, however, underlines that &#8220;the life of the fetus shall be protected from the moment of conception.&#8221; In the current interpretation, this means that it is the duty of the Hungarian state to protect fetal life, by providing medical and social protection to the pregnant mother and the fetus.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg" width="1280" height="721" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:721,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:199609,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F818e0ba5-2014-409e-8165-3d8179619c61_1280x721.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><em><strong>&#8220;Let&#8217;s Protect the Children!&#8221; reads a poster prior to Hungary&#8217;s child protection referendum.</strong></em></h3><p>It is important to note that the national law governing abortions was not changed. Act LXXIX of 1992 on the protection of fetal life allows abortions in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy for women who describe it as causing a &#8220;personal crisis,&#8221; and in the case of rape. Abortion in this period is also permissible for less severe health reasons. A pregnancy may be terminated at any point if it threatens the life of the mother, or if the fetus develops a medical condition incompatible with life post-birth. An amendment concerning fetal viability has been issued to an already existing ministerial decree issued by the Minister of Welfare in 1992 to facilitate the execution of Act LXXIX of 1992 on the protection of fetal life. The long-standing decree addresses various technical requirements, the tasks of health care institutions, administrative and bureaucratic issues. It includes the questionnaire I refer to in the next sentence.</p><p>The most recent amendment by the interior minister, S&#225;ndor Pint&#233;r, adds a line to the questionnaire that pregnant women need to fill out before this tragic procedure can proceed.

This includes evidence of a fetal heartbeat&#8212;but the heartbeat standard is merely one of several medical findings that demonstrate viability, not the sole one.</p><p><em><strong>GJP: Amnesty International called this new rule &#8220;a worrying step backwards.&#8221; How does Hungary deal with the lobbying efforts of foreign NGOs like Amnesty International and Planned Parenthood, which use Brussels and the UN to achieve goals contrary to the goods of countries?

They use various tools to manipulate international organizations and, in the case of national governments like Hungary, they use outright coercion to achieve goals quite different from our own. It&#8217;s now commonplace to observe this nexus of loosely allied, dynamic networks that cooperate instinctively around issues that they care about, by launching simultaneous influence campaigns in the global and national press, in international organizations, through special interest groups, on the internet and even in the courtroom. This is not a conspiracy theory, this is an observable conspiracy in practice, and it threatens the cornerstone of a democratic society: popular legitimacy.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The <em>Postliberal Order</em> is a reader-supported publication.

So, we&#8217;ve had to deal with their meddling on every major issue from media law, to migration, to the response to the COVID pandemic. Their work is aimed at undermining the ability of elected officials to wield legitimate political power on behalf of the citizens that elected them. A highly visible aspect of this strategy is unceasing attempts to outsource national, local competences to the federal level, to Brussels, often in direct contradiction to the treaties that govern the European Union. We have also encountered a number of political attacks from EU institutions. In my assessment, our country is a particular target for them not because we are especially vulnerable but because their tactics demonstrably fail in Hungary, where the citizens have elected conservative governments for the last twelve years&#8212;each time empowering them with a two-thirds supermajority in Parliament. Hungary remains a country where elections matter more than the aspirations of progressive influence groups. Our democracy threatens their otherwise unchecked power.</p><p>It&#8217;s true that in recent years, an immune response has developed on the right&#8212;and this frustrates our progressive brothers. It especially frustrates them to see increasing cooperation between conservatives on the international stage. This is what threatens the globalist postmodern Left, which has deployed essentially identical tactics in all Western societies to undermine the dearest values and principles of nations. A highly visible example of this international cooperation of the national forces is CPAC, which came to Europe for the first time, when CPAC Hungary was held in May of this year.</p><p><em><strong>GJP: At CPAC Dallas, Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#225;n stated, &#8220;In the last ten years the number of marriages has doubled and the number of abortions has halved in Hungary. It&#8217;s not a bad start.&#8221; What are the methods for making continued progress on this issue?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Mikl&#243;s Sz&#225;nth&#243;: </strong></em>Family policy has been a central element of the conservative government&#8217;s work since 2010 and it forms one of the pillars of the governing philosophy of Fidesz, together with the idea of the &#8220;workfare state.&#8221; It comes with an earnest realization that raising children in the twenty-first century comes with an ever-growing financial burden for young parents&#8212;but first and foremost, that having children is the most precious gift God can give. Hungary has worked systematically towards alleviating those burdens, by implementing step-by-step changes to taxation, benefits and other family policy support. These include wide-ranging tax exemptions. For instance mothers with four children do not pay income tax. They also include housing aids, loans at a discount rate guaranteed by the state, and investment schemes that grow at a guaranteed or accelerated rate.</p><p>The financial aspect to the family policy approach is not the only one, perhaps not even the most important one. Hungarian decision-makers understand that a family-friendly atmosphere, a country that remains safe for children and young parents, is crucial. In today&#8217;s Hungary starting a family commands respect in society&#8212;it is becoming more and more cool to raise children. Hungarians understand that, despite all the difficulties, they enter the happiest phase of their lives when they decide to become parents, and they feel the support of not just their friends and families, but the country as a whole. This approach is in line with the expectations of the society: a national referendum this April showed that an overwhelming majority of Hungarians want children to be protected from all the harmful influences of the postmodern globalist Left&#8212;including gender propaganda&#8212;that are out there causing real harm to persons, families and thus also nations. This ranks among the greatest achievements of this conservative decade.</p><p><em><strong>GJP: I wonder if you might further elaborate on that point. In the West we are seeing an over-the-top effort, especially by liberal corporations as well as schools, to propagandize children with information designed to confuse them. Clearly Hungary is being confronted with the same effort, but you&#8217;ve been ahead of the international curve in responding to the threat. What exactly have you done, and what are you doing now to prevent it?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Mikl&#243;s Sz&#225;nth&#243;: </strong></em>We had the advantage of being forewarned. We saw the first frightening consequences of this &#8220;LGBTQIAP+&#8221; ideology in the West before the liberal networks started work on sensitizing Hungarian society in earnest. As a result, we had the opportunity to strengthen our defenses, before they could strike. By the time the Hungarian Constitution was amended to state that &#8220;The mother shall be a woman, the father shall be a man,&#8221; our conservative movement was already aware of the obvious attempt by the postmodern Left and their liberal allies to subvert the family and traditional gender roles in North America. Moreover, the European Parliament adopted a resolution a year ago, declaring that men also have the right to be pregnant. So the Hungarian legislation in 2020 served as a preemptive strike against the gender lobby, but also prompted them to become more active. </p><p>In 2021, the National Assembly adopted the Child Protection Law, which reduced the quasi-NGOs&#8217; ability to reach children, and had the effect of drawing them into open battle before they were quite ready to unfurl their true banners. This, in turn, led to their catastrophic defeat this spring at the above-mentioned Child Protection Referendum. We must remain vigilant, but as of now our kids are safe because we&#8217;ve made common sense and the natural order to be the rule, rather than the exception in Hungary.</p><p><em><strong>GJP: Hungary has become famous for its pro-family policies. What is roughly the current state of the family support policies and what are the main challenges that they face in the current economic crisis?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Mikl&#243;s Sz&#225;nth&#243;: </strong></em>Various types of financial support for families have more than doubled in a little over a decade of conservative pro-family policies: the goal of the whole strategy is of course to boost demography, to let every wanted children to be born and to establish an environment in which women are able to find a healthy balance between family and job&#8212;e.g. nearly doubling the capacity of nursery schools served this latter one. </p><p>In 2022, Hungary will spend over 8.5 billion dollars on supporting families and children, if we include the cost of a massive tax rebate that families received early this year to help them kickstart their normal life after the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This is more than 5 percent of the GDP, the highest ratio allocated for family-support in the EU. The government has pledged to maintain the family policy initiatives despite difficult times ahead for all of Europe. Prime Minister Orb&#225;n has recently expressed his determination to preserve the pillars of Hungarian common good measures: full employment, affordable energy for households, energy security, solidarity with the elderly, maintaining a close bond with Hungarians living outside our borders, and naturally: support for the families.</p><p><em><strong>GJP: What impact does the reversal of </strong></em><strong>Roe v. Wade</strong><em><strong> in the United States have on the pro-life cause in Hungary?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Mikl&#243;s Sz&#225;nth&#243;: </strong>Roe</em> has stirred up passions in the United States, but not so much in Europe and especially Hungary. What we experience here is serious demographic problems. And that is actually a step up, because a decade ago we were in a profound demographic crisis&#8212;compared to the 1.21 fertility rate of 2010 we reached at least nearly 1.6 in 2020, despite the pandemic. What moved the needle in the right direction is slowly making the atmosphere ever more pro-family. That is why young men and women decide to set out on the greatest adventure of their lifetime&#8212;raising kids&#8212;because they feel the support and care of all of society, the entire nation. The state&#8217;s pledge to take some of the financial burden off of the shoulders of aspiring moms and dads also helps.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Errors of Will]]></title><description><![CDATA[Kevin Roberts invites a conversation about theological error in the public square.]]></description><link>https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/errors-of-will</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/errors-of-will</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Chad Pecknold]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 21:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_256,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62788117-41d1-4727-8ed6-3908168bf923_708x708.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his recent plenary address at the third National Conservatism conference in Miami, Florida, the new president of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, took aim at &#8220;integralists.&#8221; While praising their zeal, and their battle against the global wokism of the Left, he soon inveighed against them: &#8220;They think the only solution to wokism is to subordinate the state to an institutional church.

While the definition does stand against &#8220;the liberal separation of politics from the end of human life,&#8221; this in no way entails a fusion of &#8220;church and state.&#8221; Indeed, the definition continues to distinguish &#8220;two powers&#8221; &#8212; two utterly distinct institutions and jurisdictions which are nevertheless related as to the source and end of their distinct powers. Each is caused by God, each have God as their end, and each in different respects &#8212; i.e. they are always distinguished and never &#8220;fused&#8221; into one another. </p><p>Perhaps Mr Roberts was confused by the use of the word &#8220;subordinate.&#8221; But even a cursory glance at the definition would make clear that it does not and cannot mean a dictatorial or hierocratic conception of the spiritual authority &#8220;taking over&#8221; the temporal authority. That sort of &#8220;fusionism&#8221; is actually much closer to the way liberalism has worked as a &#8220;spiritual authority&#8221; to separate political communities from God (though that is a subject for another essay).</p><p>&#8220;Subordinate&#8221; means that the temporal power is lower because ordered to the end of temporal peace and justice, and the spiritual authority is higher because ordered to the perfecting principle of Christ, whose graces are communicated perfectly in and through the Catholic Church. As a definition, it doesn&#8217;t make any grand claims about how such a recognition of hierarchy would cash out in different political communities. In fact, the definition is quite modest. It only recognizes some principles of order, leaving open a wide range of possibilities for rightly relating distinct higher and lower powers in a variety of historical contexts and conditions.</p><p>What should be clear by now is that this definition of integralism never speaks of &#8220;a fusion&#8221; of two powers, nor does it envision a hierocratic rule of priests, nor does it even insist on a single course of political action. </p><p><em><strong>The Truth About Free Will</strong></em></p><p>While Mr. Roberts&#8217; failure to understand this widely available definition is to be lamented, I found it refreshing that he turned to make a theological argument in public. This itself is not something to scorn but to celebrate. Theological truth and error are constantly at work in our public disputes, and so it is better to make our theological premises explicit. Mr. Roberts missed his target by misunderstanding a definition, but his second theological charge was more interesting: his unnamed integralists denied <em>free will</em>. </p><p>He made clear a contrast between  a protestant nation which safeguards &#8220;free will&#8221; for all, and those who would deny that freedom is a first-order good. In support of his own view that America&#8217;s protestantism is good for Catholicism and America alike, he appealed to papal authority on the freedom of the will, invoking Pope St. John Paul II&#8217;s affirmation of the &#8220;legitimate autonomy&#8221; of the temporal power, and his emphasis upon freedom. Though in the very sentences he cites, the pope speaks of both &#8220;freedom and obedience.&#8221; Why would freedom be paired with obedience in Catholic teaching? This is a question that Mr. Roberts does not ask, but since the implication is that &#8220;integralists&#8221; are in error about the free choice of the will, and Mr. Roberts claims to better represent Catholic teaching, it&#8217;s necessary for me to don my <em>missio canonica </em>as a theologian, and examine what the Church actually does teach about the freedom and obedience of the will, and whether integralists or fusionists are manifestly at odds with it.</p><p>Behind Pope St. John Paul&#8217;s pairing of &#8220;freedom and obedience&#8221; stands Fr. Servais Pinckaer&#8217;s famous distinction between the &#8220;freedom of indifference&#8221; and the &#8220;freedom for excellence.&#8221; The pope was in the habit of holding together freedom and obedience precisely because he understood the proper teaching on the free choice of the will: our freedom is not in the power to choose itself (indifferent to what is being chosen) but rather our freedom is to be found in the will&#8217;s conformity to what is true and good, which is to say in conformity with God as our final end. </p><p>These distinctions should be familiar to Catholics. They are, in fact, very ancient ones which go back to Saul being knocked off his horse on the way to Damascus. One of the most famous articulations of the Church&#8217;s teaching on the nature of our freedom is found in St. Augustine&#8217;s <em>De libero arbitrio voluntatis</em>, on the free choice of the will. It is a philosophical dialogue with Augustine&#8217;s friend Evodius who is asking whether we could ever say that God is the cause of the evils that we choose. He puts his question in a variety of different ways, but it was essentially this: If God created us with the power of choice, then isn&#8217;t God ultimately culpable for our inclination to sin? Augustine answers that evil is nothing other than the absurd turning away from Goodness (<em>privatio Boni</em>) which occurs in the lower appetites of the will, not in the higher parts of the rational soul which is restless only for God. Our will is &#8220;subordinate&#8221; to the intellect, but the trouble with our will is that it can disorder our intellectual desire for the good, and so make the intellect &#8220;the slave of cupidity.&#8221;</p><p>Mr. Roberts mentioned the consequences of original sin, and Augustine teaches that the will is weakened after the Fall, and so requires help. For the will to be free, it requires help not only from the intellect (which is required before the Fall) but also supernatural assistance. The idea that the freedom of the soul is precisely in the choosing power is not unknown in history. It was the view held by none of other than Augustine&#8217;s opponent, Pelagius, who taught that the excellence of our nature was in our capacity to choose. &#8220;The glory of the reasonable soul is located precisely&#8230;in it freedom to follow either path [good or evil].&#8221; (<em>Letter to Demetrias</em>, 3) As Augustine showed, Pelagius believed what made us free was precisely our power to choose. Indeed, this power to choose is what Pelagius called &#8220;grace.&#8221; So when bishops inquired as to whether he believed that God&#8217;s grace was necessary, Pelagius would say yes, but what he meant was the grace of our choosing capacity. God gave us the capacity to choose, and so gave us the power &#8220;to will and to do&#8221; according to that capacity. Augustine responded that this was really a rejection of divine assistance at the level of human will and action. Pelagius had made the choosing capacity the very glory of the soul, and the condition for virtue, whereas Augustine located the freedom of the soul only in willing and doing what is right and just. For Augustine, freedom is not in our choosing power, but is found only in those acts which arise from a recognition of right order, and proper use of the will. </p><p>Which brings me to the question that Mr. Roberts raised. It is indeed bad if his unnamed integralists have fallen into an error about free will. But what exactly is the error he has in mind? Pelagius thought Augustine had denied the freedom of the will because he stressed obedience to God, since God does not command what is impossible, but only what is right and just. This raises a question for me as a theologian. Is it integralists who have fallen into an error about the will, or is it the new fusionists?</p><p><em><strong>Free Will at the Origins of Fusionism </strong></em></p><p>In 1962 Frank Meyer wrote his famous essay in <em>National Review</em> on &#8220;The Twisted View of Liberty.&#8221; In that essay, he proposed a fusion not of church and state, but a fusion of &#8220;the traditionalist&#8221; and &#8220;libertarian&#8221; views. The traditionalist view was that God has established a moral order and we must conform ourselves to it; the libertarian view was that a choice is only free if it is freely chosen, &#8220;uncoerced.&#8221; That would surely exclude regarding Saul&#8217;s conversion on the way to Damascus as a movement towards freedom, but fits very well with the view of Pelagius. You would think these views were as incompatible as Augustine and Pelagius, but not for the secular minded Meyer. He thought these two views could be fused. As Meyer put it, &#8220;fusing&#8221; the traditionalist and libertarian positions &#8220;recognizes at one and the same time the transcendent goal of human existence and the primacy of the freedom of the person. &#8230; [I]t maintains that the duty of men is to seek virtue; but it insists that men cannot in actuality do so unless they are free from the physical coercion of an unlimited state.&#8221; What Meyer actually does is fuse two competing views of freedom, and calls them harmonious, and this &#8220;fusion&#8221; has plagued conservatism ever since. </p><p>The immediate response to Meyer came from the by-then-marginalized figure of L. Brent Bozell who argued essentially what I am arguing, that this is an utterly incoherent and errant fusionism that will have very bad effects on our country and on our faith. Bozell took the Augustinian view that freedom was hierarchically directed towards virtue, and the human will needed assistance, the help of law and custom, and yes true religion. For Bozell, freedom only has value in relation to ends, so the <em>freedom</em> of the will needs help, and it is the place of custom, law and true religion to provide an order in which it is easier for people to choose truly good ends. Bozell gave the example of divorce laws in Spain where they were still restrictive vs. the United States where they were becoming lax. In one order, legal limits on divorce actually aided human beings to choose the common good over private preference, whereas the other regarded that one could only be virtuous if you were truly free to get divorced without any impediment from government. In which scenario, he asked, is the will more free?</p><p>I do not know if this is what Kevin Roberts meant in his appeal to free will. I suspect the very ambiguity is writ into the Meyerian fusionism which has plagued conservatism for so many decades, and which still seems at work in the desire to construct &#8220;a new fusionism.&#8221; The appeal emphasis upon the freedom of the will has deep roots not in the teaching of the Catholic Church but rather in the modern conservative movement itself. </p><p>Is he more with Frank Meyer, or more with Bozell? Is he more with Pelagius or Augustine? One is at odds with Catholic teaching, one is at war with it, and the fusion of both views sits at the heart of the incoherence of the old fusionist movement, and possibly the new fusion re-emerging around these disputes. At the end of his plenary address, Mr. Roberts invited us to talk as friends about the way we must go. I would welcome that conversation, but as fellow Americans and fellow Catholics who want only to know what is true and good, public <em>ad hominem</em> aimed at things not yet understand is no way forward.</p><p>The libertarian appeal to the individual as a sovereign chooser is fundamentally liberal, and while one could argue it is fundamentally American, it cannot be argued that it is fundamentally Catholic. Which leaves Mr. Roberts in a difficult theological position with respect to the charges he has leveled against unnamed persons. Either he can affirm the Catholic teaching summed up in Pope St John Paul II&#8217;s phrase &#8220;freedom and obedience&#8221; as being in accord with the Augustinian and Thomistic tradition, or he can make that unnatural fusion that Mr. Meyer made long ago at the beginning of the conservative movement which has lost so much for us in the intervening years.</p><p>Roberts&#8217; said that he was patriotic for his &#8220;protestant country&#8221; suggesting that protestantism was good for his Catholicism. This was similar to a sentiment expressed at NatCon&#8217;s panel on Catholic Political Thought. As Professor Mary Imparato reported in these pages,</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;In his plenary address, Heritage president <a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/kevin-roberts-phd">Kevin Roberts</a> said integralists&#8217; zeal had led them into the error of seeking a fusion of church and state. Roberts, a <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahhopeweaver/status/1553107844941103106?s=21&amp;t=7QSCu2gIzIY_0xp154g5LA">self-described West Coast Straussian</a> (but we&#8217;ll leave discussion of that error for another day), claimed that integralist positions undermine free will, which is essential on our path of salvation. He did extend an olive branch however, requesting that these conversations continue as among family members and not as among enemies. <a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-3-2022/presenters/daniel-burns/">Daniel Burns</a> took an alternate approach to integralism, arguing from what he claimed was a realist standpoint. Because the American voting public is largely Protestant or ex-Protestant, for religion to have any impact on public life, he said that religion would have to be some version of the Christianity that Alexis de Tocqueville saw: &#8220;low-church Protestant and reconciled to Mammon.&#8221; While eschewing secularism, Burns said that we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that the United States is now and &#8220;in some sense ought to remain&#8221; Protestant.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>My only quibble with Professor Imparato&#8217;s reporting here is that, in truth, Professor Burns does not have an alternate approach to Mr. Roberts, but the same one. Just as Professor Burns spoke in defense of protestantism as America&#8217;s proper civic religion, and just as he spoke in favor of a Catholic political posture that&#8217;s reconciled to protestantism and mammon alike, so did Mr Roberts signal that it&#8217;s precisely America&#8217;s protestantism that&#8217;s good for Catholicism. Now I am believer in friendly ecumenism, and cooperation between Christians, but this is something different than that. Roberts spoke against &#8220;Big Church&#8221; in the same tones as he spoke against &#8220;Big Tech,&#8221; &#8220;Big Pharma,&#8221; and &#8220;Big Government.&#8221; I fear that this tendency to speak against &#8220;Big Church&#8221; is deeply protestant, and I fear most of all that it is a form of anti-Catholic hatred of self.</p><p>I am as frustrated and saddened as anyone, indeed, more aggrieved than most, that the Church in her lower parts, i.e. in her members, has been so vicious and sinful, now, in recent decades, and throughout history. But what saddens me saddens me even more is the false theological conclusions this produces in some. Early on his plenary address, Roberts insinuated that the integralists must be dismissed because of the priest abuse crisis, saying &#8220;Integralists, heal thyselves&#8221; in light of such sin and disorder in the lower parts of the Church. It grieves me that so many American Catholics, left and right, have taken the liberal, and frankly anti-Catholic view that this means the Catholic Church &#8212; &#8220;Big Church,&#8221; as Mr. Roberts put it &#8212; is somehow defective, that it is not the divinely instituted ark of the very purifying principle for souls and cities alike. Mr. Roberts aim was not admirable here, ascribing the ugly sins of the &#8220;massive child abusive scandal&#8221; to the &#8220;leading lights&#8221; of integralism was the sort of vulgar <em>ad hominem</em> one expects from anonymous anti-Catholic accounts on Twitter, not from respectable Catholic leaders on podiums. But it also revealed a deeply problematic &#8220;Americanism&#8221; which has plagued Catholic thinkers in this country for a very long time, and for which we are seeking a cure.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What I Saw at NatCon]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mary Imparato reports on the elephant in the room at the recent Burke Foundation conference on national conservatism]]></description><link>https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/what-i-saw-at-natcon</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/what-i-saw-at-natcon</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Guest Author]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 14:16:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0db1c69e-480e-407d-befe-5e2850332dc5_640x360.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Mary Imparato is assistant professor and chair of the Politics Department at Belmont Abbey College.

This year&#8217;s was the largest and most successful NatCon since the conferences began in 2019, with nine hundred attendees, and speeches from marquee conservative politicians like Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio. I wanted to experience firsthand how well national conservatism represented the New Right, and inquire after the contours of a &#8220;new fusionism&#8221; that seems not so unlike the old one. I wanted to know: to what extent does national conservatism adopt the critiques of liberalism popularized by the <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300240023/why-liberalism-failed/">prominent postliberals</a> represented here at <em><a href="http://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe">Postliberal Order</a></em>, and further, is there any room in this big tent for Catholic integralists? Based on my experience at NatCon3, the answer to the former is &#8220;somewhat&#8221;&#8212;but the answer to the latter is that the most coherent Catholic postliberal political thinkers weren&#8217;t even there, and their absence tells the whole story.</p><p>What follows are some reflections on national conservatism&#8217;s self-definition, the place of the postliberal critique and integralism

class="paywall-jump"></div><p><strong>Where Have All the Neocons Gone?</strong></p><p>&#8203;According to Christopher DeMuth, the chair of the NatCon3 conference committee, the definition of national conservatism or the New Right (synonymous terms for him) goes beyond &#8220;anti-woke.&#8221; In his opening address, he recounted that the movement began in earnest in 2019 and, though they <a href="https://compactmag.com/article/here-comes-fusionism-2-0">lost some comrades</a> along the way, they are essentially committed to defending American freedom. DeMuth noted that the movement (which Peter Thiel compared to Star Wars&#8217; &#8220;ragtag Rebel Alliance&#8221;) is united by a shared perception of the many worrying symptoms in diseased American life, even though the various New Right constituencies may differ as to prescriptions.</p><p>In crafting its self-definition, the New Right has very clearly identified the opposition: the neo-Marxist woke Left which seeks to indoctrinate and/or mutilate children, exploit racial divisions, enforce groupthink in universities, the media and throughout the government, control the populace with public health panics, drugs and porn, and which ruthlessly pursues its political opponents unimpeded by the rule of law. Further, the New Right is self-consciously distinct from the Old Right fusionism between social conservatives and the free-market-&#252;ber-alles libertarians, with their faith in the invisible hand and penchant for creative destruction. The new fusionism appears to be a blend of social conservatism, America First nationalism, and economic populism, with a healthy dose of &#8220;biblical Christianity&#8221; thrown in.</p><p>One does wonder where that leaves the neocons. Sure, there were numerous laments over the seven thousand American lives and trillions of dollars lost in the forever wars of the last twenty years, but no criticism of the neocon hawks for undertaking these foreign misadventures. I cannot recall once hearing the term &#8220;neocon&#8221; used by any speaker, in either praise or derision. Have the neocons been quietly absorbed into the national conservative fold? If this is the case, it is only a matter of time until their interventionist tendencies find an outlet.</p><p><strong>Catholic Integralists </strong><em><strong>In Absentia</strong></em></p><p>&#8203;Among integralists, many mainstream &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are often referred to as &#8220;right-liberals,&#8221; which assumes, of course, that conservatives embrace the political philosophy of liberalism while asking it to slow the pace of its societal alterations. As to whether national conservatives are &#8220;right-liberals&#8221; in this sense, the answer is mixed.</p><p>I was able to ask a panel addressing the &#8220;Future of Conservatism&#8221; to what extent they saw that future as postliberal. No one attempted a full-throated defense of classical Lockean liberalism, and this seems to be a hopeful sign in the new fusionism. <a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-3-2022/presenters/david-azerrad/">David Azerrad</a> claimed that the founders had a more nuanced view of liberalism than the Lockean individualism Patrick Deneen describes. He said that postliberals and libertarians agree&#8212;both define liberalism as essentially atomized and individualistic, yet while postliberals say this is bad, libertarians say this is good. We should conceive of liberalism in its best sense, according to Azerrad, by looking to key contributions like property rights and freedom of religion. <a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-3-2022/presenters/ofir-haivry/">Ofir Haivry</a>, on the other hand, sought to distance himself from liberalism by saying that property rights aren&#8217;t a liberal idea, and that he &#8220;owes to liberalism as much as [he] owes to socialism.&#8221; I despaired that the critique of liberalism would yet again be bogged down in a definitional morass.</p><p>&#8203;Enter NatCon founder Yoram Hazony, whose plenary address was, excepting Ron DeSantis&#8217;s speech, the most acclaimed of the conference. He provided clarity, defining liberalism as the idea that individuals are free and equal by right, and adding, &#8220;If you believe this, then you are a liberal.&#8221; While some on the right claim that the poisonous version of liberalism <a href="https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/the-progressive-movement-and-the-transformation-american-politics">emerged with the Progressives</a> of the early twentieth century, Hazony identifies the deadly strain of liberalism becoming the &#8220;public religion&#8221; in the postwar period, and remaining thus until unseated by &#8220;woke neo-Marxism&#8221; as the dominant ideology in 2020. The very liberalism that paved the way for this troubling new ideology cannot be relied upon to stop it. Rather, Hazony&#8212;launching into a full jeremiad&#8212;implored the audience to face woke-ism with a life of &#8220;conservation and repentance,&#8221; embracing the things that we&#8217;ve lost like God, religion, loyalty, honor, family.</p><p>Hazony incisively identified a flawed view of freedom as liberalism&#8217;s chief defect. &#8220;When you are raised as a liberal,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and told to do what makes you happy, then freedom becomes everything, and the main thing you are free from is the past. Freed from God, scripture, parents, nation, man and woman.&#8221;&nbsp;He called on the tens of millions of &#8220;Bible-believing Christians&#8221; to bring these things back through repentance and reform of life, making America a Nineveh rather than a Sodom. This message is necessary and powerful, as far as it goes. Communal life, however, is built upon a coming-together, a sharing of ends and, in short, a principle of unity with a strong enough gravitational pull to hold a community together. If liberalism has proven inadequate, can &#8220;biblical Christianity&#8221; be that force? Given that Christianity&#8212;when devoid of its own principle of unity in the form of tradition and authority&#8212;has devolved into thousands of denominations, it is a dubious proposition. Nonetheless, a panel of Protestant integralists sought to make the case.</p><p>Protestant panelists argued for a postliberal politics which is self-consciously distinct from Catholic attempts at the same. <a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-3-2022/presenters/brad-littlejohn/">Brad Littlejohn</a> lamented the fact that, thus far, postliberalism has been dominated by Roman Catholics who, with a &#8220;tendentious&#8221; history, blame the Reformation for the rise of liberalism. He argued for a postliberalism, rooted in the writings of the earliest Protestant leaders, that seeks to restrain wickedness and promote virtue. When articulating what this postliberal order might entail, Littlejohn, whose recommendation was admittedly &#8220;thin,&#8221; espoused a symbolic politics whereby politicians lead by example, as when Teddy Roosevelt modeled the solid American family to help renew that institution in American life. <a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-3-2022/presenters/timon-cline/">Timon Cline</a>, too, acknowledged that Protestants have been &#8220;late to the party,&#8221; but unlike Catholic postliberals who reference nineteenth-century papal encyclicals and look to eastern Europe, Protestants can look to our seventeenth-century colonial &#8220;founders&#8221; who came to establish a social, political and religious order in their image.</p><p>As an aside, Cline remarked that he wanted to remind Catholics that Viktor Orb&#225;n is a self-professed Calvinist, adding that he&#8217;s &#8220;not sure why they keep going over there.&#8221; That comment&#8212;apart from being needlessly hostile&#8212;is also rather ignorant, as the Hungarian religious population is 4:1 Catholic to Protestant, Orb&#225;n&#8217;s wife and daughters are Catholic, and the prime minister himself has called Hungary a Catholic nation. Cline went on to argue the postliberal point that politics cannot be predicated on difference, but must foster unity to provide a basis for common action. I would note that Protestantism, marked by its ever-burgeoning number of splits into various denominations, hardly seems like a strong foundation on which to build this desired unity. If, as Hazony claims, liberalism is marked by a freedom from the past, what can be more liberal than declaring oneself free from tradition? The problem of authority will forever plague Protestant postliberals.</p><p>In this regard, <a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-3-2022/presenters/aaron-renn/">Aaron Renn</a>&#8217;s talk embracing liberalism as Protestant was refreshing. He acknowledged that the Christian wing of the conservative movement has been Catholic-normative, observing, &#8220;There&#8217;s something about conservatism that&#8217;s highly resonant with a Catholic register.&#8221; To attract more Protestants to the movement, he argued conservatives must start acknowledging that &#8220;our political tradition <em>is</em> liberal,&#8221; warning that integralism is a &#8220;nonstarter&#8221; in America. He called for a more Protestant and evangelical conservatism (&#8220;We can&#8217;t keep outsourcing intellectual tasks to the Catholics&#8221;) and noted that prominent liberalism critic Patrick Deneen is &#8220;very anti-Protestant.&#8221; National Conservatism&#8217;s answer to my question about whether the future of conservatism is postliberal is decidedly: it depends on who you ask.</p><p>&#8203;While Protestant postliberals (and liberals) were given a platform within the National Conservatism conference, one might ask how the Catholic postliberal panel went. Had it existed, it would have been outstanding. Why this omission when Catholic postliberals have some of the most innovative ideas for industrial and <a href="https://www.americanmoment.org/family-policy-imperative-pappin/">family policy</a>? Certainly, we can find more robust ideas there than a suggestion that politicians should be role models. What became evident throughout was that Protestant postliberalism (a contradiction in terms) is utterly toothless, while a Catholic one ois not. </p><p>This is not to say that there were <em>no</em> Catholics present at NatCon. Judging by the cheers during Hazony&#8217;s speech when he called on Catholics to combat woke-ism, they made up possibly 40 percent of attendees. Several Catholics who spoke, however, made a point to countersignal integralism. In his plenary address, Heritage president <a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/kevin-roberts-phd">Kevin Roberts</a> said integralists&#8217; zeal had led them into the error of seeking a fusion of church and state. Roberts, a <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahhopeweaver/status/1553107844941103106?s=21&amp;t=7QSCu2gIzIY_0xp154g5LA">self-described West Coast Straussian</a> (but we&#8217;ll leave discussion of that error for another day), claimed that integralist positions undermine free will, which is essential on our path of salvation. He did extend an olive branch however, requesting that these conversations continue as among family members and not as among enemies. <a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-3-2022/presenters/daniel-burns/">Daniel Burns</a> took an alternate approach to integralism, arguing from what he claimed was a realist standpoint. Because the American voting public is largely Protestant or ex-Protestant, for religion to have any impact on public life, he said that religion would have to be some version of the Christianity that Alexis de Tocqueville saw: &#8220;low-church Protestant and reconciled to Mammon.&#8221; While eschewing secularism, Burns said that we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that the United States is now and &#8220;in some sense ought to remain&#8221; Protestant. This <a href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/therapists-of-decline">defeatist</a> tone stands in sharp contrast to the rousing call to arms issued by Hazony in which he urged the movement to trust a God who gives unlikely victories.</p><p><strong>Forging Ahead</strong></p><p>&#8203;While I&#8217;ve focused on the relationship of national conservatism to postliberalism, the conference addressed many more topics, on most of which postliberals and conservatives can find common ground. Everyone agrees that the nation is a political common good, a majority believes that the administrative state power can be wielded by conservatives to advance their political ends, and all agree that the nation is in a spiral of national decline reflected in everything from the collapse of marriage, birth rates, gender ideology, the decimation of the working class, and our attempts to self-medicate against all the despair. </p><p>National conservatives and Catholic postliberals bring different approaches to the battle. National conservatives focus on tactics in waging the present war against woke-ism, but they lack any coherent vision at which they are aiming. While a practical approach is needed, we ought also to imagine what an ideal arrangement might be, looking to a polestar while navigating the waves. The jamboree of a new fusionism may be unavoidable, but can it succeed without facing, rather than dismissing, the most pressing structural problems of order raised by the most thoroughgoing critics of liberalism? </p><p>The final address of the conference was subtitled, &#8220;The Dangerous Illusion of a &#8216;Secular&#8217; State.&#8221; Yet the absence of Catholic integralists at the conference prompted me to ask: Why not phrase this statement the other way around? Who is bold enough to argue for &#8220;The Salutary Vision of a Religious State&#8221;? Catholic integralists possess this vision in a more coherent form than any I heard at NatCon3. &nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/what-i-saw-at-natcon?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/what-i-saw-at-natcon?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Liberal Origins of the Great Awokening]]></title><description><![CDATA[Patrick Deneen debates Bret Stephens on Bari Weiss&#8217;s &#8220;Honestly&#8221;]]></description><link>https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/liberal-origins-of-wokeness</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/liberal-origins-of-wokeness</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick J.

My position was that many of our worsening contemporary pathologies&#8212;both social and economic&#8212;have arisen from too much <em>bad</em> freedom, and not enough good liberty&#8212;i.e., too much liberalism, and not enough classical and Christian liberty. Bret Stephens&#8212;obviously, to anyone who knows his worldview&#8212;took the opposite position. </p><p>In a number of instances there were concrete questions that touched on policy. One of the areas that came under debate was whether government should seek to support family formation&#8212;encouraging marriage and children through public financial support backed by the force of law. Stephens held that as long as no one <em>prevented </em>someone from forming a family and having children, they were sufficiently free, and&#8212;that being the case&#8212;there was no particular need for government support. His position was reminiscent of a slightly altered observation of Anatole France: &#8220;The law, in its majestic silence, allows the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.&#8221; </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg" width="720" height="405" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:405,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:81292,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd9e346-0243-4ef3-b542-346591ed2ce9_720x405.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I argued that we now live in a social and economic order in which to be married and to have children is for many, even possibly <em>most</em> of our countrymen and countrywomen, far more difficult than to eschew one or both. To allow the possibility of a <em>genuine choice</em> that allowed people to marry, to have children, and to have one or both parents able to spend time at home raising those children themselves, and <em>not</em> amount to a condition of extreme financial duress, required assistance of the public order. For the liberal, the appearance of <em>theoretical choice</em> suffices; for the postliberal, genuine choice&#8212;and moreover, encouragement to make the <em>better choice </em>that requires thinking beyond individual self-interest&#8212;cannot exist in the absence of a wide range of public, civic, and familial support.</p><p>Further, I argued, the public order has a vested interest in encouraging the formation of families with children, and not only because a nation seeks to foster conditions generative of future generations. As I argue in this clip below (via Twitter), for most humans, we come to learn most deeply about the extent of nearly limitless yet ordinary self-sacrifice when we have our own children.

For Bret Stephens&#8212;and, I suspect, Bari Weiss&#8212;progressive wokeness is an aberration from good, old-fashioned liberalism. What I attempted to convey to both of them, and to her audience, was that the key elements of &#8220;wokeness&#8221; arise not from some successor philosophy, such as &#8220;cultural Marxism,&#8221; as most classical liberals wish to claim. Rather, I argued, it is the natural and even inevitable outgrowth of liberalism&#8217;s core feature of <em>transgression</em>. Nothing revealed this difference more than a brief debate between Stephens and myself over how to understand the legacy of John Stuart Mill:</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Postliberal Order is a reader-supported publication.

The actual title of his book should have been <em>On Progress</em>, or <em>How Liberty Leads to Progress</em>. The answer: by destroying tradition and overturning a conservative order shaped on behalf of ordinary people, in favor of a revolutionary order that favors a few.</p><p>The society that Mill above all seeks to bring about is one that encourages the <em>liberation</em> of transgressive individuals from social, cultural, and traditional norms. He picks up the liberal baton where John Locke left it: having successfully created liberal political orders that secure individual rights, Mill&#8217;s concern was that such rights were useless unless people were freed from what he called the &#8220;the despotism of Custom.&#8221;The main purpose of <em>On Liberty</em> is not to secure <em>political</em> liberty&#8212;which he believed had been largely achieved in nations such as England&#8212;but <em>social</em> freedom, a freedom that required the positive disassembling of customs and tradition. This was especially needful for the nonconformists, people who wanted to flout the norms that governed most of everyday life. Among the despotisms that hold back the nonconformists we can see clearly today include: the expectation that people would marry and have children at some point in their early adulthood; that they would be members in good standing of a religious congregation; and that they would conduct themselves with comportment and decency.</p><p>Being thus freed, Mill further argued, the genuine purpose of liberty might emerge:  <em>Progress</em>. Until people were sufficiently freed from the &#8220;despotism of Custom,&#8221; progress was thwarted. As long as nonconformists were prevented from engaging in &#8220;experiments in living,&#8221; societies would tend to replicate themselves. Traditions would be passed from one generation to the next.</p><p>Most societies, he wrote, had &#8220;no history,&#8221; properly speaking&#8212;that is, things happened from one day to the next, but there was no <em>progressive trajectory to history</em>. Only when the social &#8220;default&#8221; switched from &#8220;tradition&#8221; to &#8220;experimentalism&#8221; would proper and progressive history <em>begin</em>. </p><p>For this reason, Mill feared that the hoi polloi<em> </em>were the greatest danger to genuine liberty: they were always a conservative obstacle to genuine progress. Mill was unstinting in his criticisms of &#8220;conservatives,&#8221; famously calling them the &#8220;stupid party&#8221; and arguing on behalf of plural votes that would increase with the number of a  educational degrees attained by an individual. Moreover, in regard to benighted people who lived in highly traditional societies, he argued that in such cases, tyranny (at least for a time) was justified in the name of liberty:</p><blockquote><p>A ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end. . . . Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.</p></blockquote><p>What &#8220;classical liberals&#8221; such as Bret Stephens (and Bari Weiss) abhor about &#8220;progressives&#8221; is their authoritarianism. How peculiar&#8212;and revealing&#8212;that Bret Stephens would have lauded a work titled <em>On Liberty</em>, apparently not realizing that the heirs of Mill would someday decry backwards people as &#8220;deplorables&#8221; who &#8220;cling&#8221; to their Bibles. Such liberals believe they can put the despotic genie back into the bottle by supporting unfettered liberty. This is also what Mill wanted, a position that led to the call for despotism over the unwashed masses. Unbeknownst to seemingly well-educated &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; like Bret Stephens is the inconvenient fact that it was the fruits of their own philosophy that let out liberalism&#8217;s inner despot. Only a postliberal order can teach anew a better kind of liberty.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirror of Princes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s rule shows us not only the political wisdom of the past, but guidance for a better political future]]></description><link>https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/mirror-of-princes</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/mirror-of-princes</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gladden Pappin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 13:14:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85677375-e53e-41b5-9ad2-ce6bae5d9eb1_496x279.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg" width="496" height="279" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:279,&quot;width&quot;:496,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:180385,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61e4f7f8-e7be-43cc-9a6a-a3cd90e59b05_496x279.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Beloved of her subjects, untouched by scandal, faultless in public demeanor, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has passed to her eternal reward. She has already been mourned as the last link to a world that now seems distant and faded&#8212;a lone bridge between the last empires and what is now a tattered, post-democratic world. Lest this sentiment fade into nostalgia, however, it is important to name the specific quality that marked the queen&#8217;s rule and comprised her other virtues.</p><p>Prudence, elegance, graciousness, aplomb, patience, benignity, justice, temperance, charity, religion, modesty and fidelity were all among the jewels in her crown. But what knit them together and set them in their place was the practice, fading and now faded, of <em>duty of state</em>.</p><p>In the concept of duty of state, the prince or princess, and as well the magistrate or statesman, does not merely exhibit qualities worthy of personal sympathy. The queen&#8217;s elegance, for example, is not merely a memorial to a time when statesmen attended dignified parties rather than, say, rave parties in Helsinki. Instead, <em>a different nature of rule occasioned a different sort of virtue</em>. The queen&#8217;s virtues were not simply extraordinary forms of ordinary virtues. Rather, they were excellent forms of virtues proper to her office&#8212;virtues she was specifically taught and had the opportunity to practice.</p><p>How were those specific virtues produced in the queen, and why are they so far from us today? The answer gets to the heart of much contemporary malaise.  What has caused duty of state to fade, in turn, is the fading away of <em>rule</em>.</p><div class="paywall-jump"></div><p>The notion of duties proper to office lies at the core of the classical legal and political tradition to which <em>Postliberal Order</em> (along with <em><a href="https://iusetiustitium.com">Ius et Iustitium</a></em>)<em> </em>is dedicated&#8212;so much so that the Latin word for duty, <em>officium</em>, eventually came to be used for &#8220;office&#8221; itself. In book 3, chapter 4 of his <em>Politics</em>, Aristotle raises the question whether the virtues of an excellent citizen and a good man are identical. In the course of his answer, Aristotle observes that the virtues take different forms among rulers and ruled. Citizens can become rulers and vice versa, but rulers, as rulers, have one overriding and specific virtue&#8212;<em>prudence</em>:</p><blockquote><p>But prudence is the only virtue peculiar to the ruler. The others, it would seem, must necessarily be common to both rulers and ruled, but prudence is not a virtue of one ruled, but rather true opinion; for the one ruled is like a flute maker, while the ruler is like a flute player, the user. (trans. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DJP44GomyNoC">Lord</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Prudence is proper to political rulers because it is their office or duty to have care of the whole community. Officeholders have specific cares as well as a perspective and responsibility distinct from ordinary citizens; it is for this reason that, under the classical understanding, they are owed deference in their prudential decisions. By the same token and on account of this responsibility, throughout the subsequent centuries down to modern times, the education of a prince or ruler <em>in their specific virtues</em> was considered essential to good government. Indeed, for much of Western history attention to the ruler&#8217;s virtues was the primary concern of and locus of &#8220;political theory.&#8221;</p><p>In the Middle Ages, Giles of Rome&#8217;s <em>On the Rule of Princes </em>was written for the education of Philip IV of France (r. 1285&#8211;1314). In it, Giles begins by emphasizing that a prince&#8217;s happiness <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr47AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">is not to be found</a> in pleasures, riches, honors, glory, fame, civil power, bodily strength or beauty, but in the love of God <em>and the practice of prudence</em>. (My colleague Chad Pecknold <a href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/out-of-the-feverish-city-part-two">discussed Augustine&#8217;s mirror of princes here</a>.)</p><p>Cicero&#8217;s <em>On Offices</em> had long since become a primary text of this tradition by holding up to princes, as in a mirror, the virtues that they would need for the performance of their official tasks.</p><blockquote><p>In general those who are about to take charge of public affairs should hold fast to Plato&#8217;s two pieces of advice: first to fix their gaze so firmly on what is beneficial to the citizens that whatever they do, they do with that in mind, forgetful of their own advantage. Secondly, let them care for the whole body of the republic rather than protect one part and neglect the rest. The management of the republic is like a guardianship, and must be conducted in the light of what is beneficial not to the guardians, but to those who are put in their charge. (<em>De officiis</em> 1.85, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PuONLmVUW4QC">trans. Griffin &amp; Atkins</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Nearly two thousand years later, the different elements of this tradition come together in a striking way in then princess Elizabeth&#8217;s message on her twenty-first birthday, delivered in 1947 by radio broadcast from Cape Town:</p><blockquote><p>To accomplish that [viz., preserving and improving the commonwealth] we must give nothing less than the whole of ourselves. There is a motto which has been borne by many of my ancestors&#8212;a noble motto, &#8220;I serve.&#8221; Those words were an inspiration to many bygone heirs to the Throne when they made their knightly dedication as they came to manhood. I cannot do quite as they did.</p><p>But through the inventions of science I can do what was not possible for any of them. I can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole Empire listening. I should like to make that dedication now. It is very simple.</p><p><strong>I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.</strong> (my emphasis; source: <a href="https://www.royal.uk/21st-birthday-speech-21-april-1947">The Royal Household</a>)</p></blockquote><p>As Princess Elizabeth explained, the notion of service&#8212;complete dedication of one&#8217;s personality to one&#8217;s office&#8212;lay at the heart of the classical conception that the knightly tradition incarnated. This dedication was not supposed to culminate in exhaustion through ambition, or &#8220;being a climber.&#8221;</p><p>For those of us living under liberal democratic systems, this conception has gradually become difficult to grasp. The virtues of a great ruler are <em>not</em> merely personal accomplishments. The queen did not occupy her office as a reward for good behavior, or because she took leadership classes in middle school, went on to win a Rhodes Scholarship, do consulting and private equity, and then run for office. The scheme is almost exactly reversed.</p><p><strong>Where Have All the Virtues Gone?</strong></p><p>Recovering the possibility of duty of state is not as simple as it may seem. Queen Elizabeth could learn her &#8220;duties of state&#8221; because her state in life was predetermined: she was already a princess and would soon become queen. But monarchy is also not the sole precondition for developing such virtues. Instead, such virtues come from the concept of &#8220;office.&#8221; In order to have the virtues corresponding to one&#8217;s duties of state, the corresponding <em>office</em> has to exist. In the American context, this concept has sometimes been preserved in the nexus of qualities called &#8220;presidential&#8221;&#8212;not surprisingly, since it is a quasi-monarchical office.</p><p>Paradoxically, investing political offices with a sense of <em>duty of state</em> requires making them more fully what they are rather than seeking to limit them solely through external constraints. Once political life came to be viewed, under an early form of liberalism, as the clash of irreconcilable interests, the role of the statesman and his virtues became correspondingly diminished. As Madison famously put it, &#8220;enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm.&#8221;</p><p>Liberalism has long advertised itself as putting an end to the personal, direct politics of ages past. In liberal democracy, we need not pray for an enlightened monarch to rise and set everything in order. Instead of being subjected to the whims of royalty or, even worse, of the clergy, liberalism would establish a smooth-functioning, rational public square, within which free individuals would be able to contribute to the public good through rational activity in economy, state and society.</p><p>Ironically but predictably, as the powers of state offices became more restricted those occupying them came to have less prudence. The raw skills that could be shaped into prudence&#8212;Giles of Rome <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr47AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA40-IA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">named them</a> as memory, foresight, intellect, reason, cleverness, docility, experience and precaution&#8212;were instead drawn toward and rewarded by the market, gradually turning them toward private gain.</p><p>At the same time, the personal traits of officeholders in liberal democracy have become only more glaring. Insistence on telling one&#8217;s &#8220;personal story&#8221; in campaigning has shifted the qualification for office ever further toward bathos. As the system has produced ever more dysfunctional results&#8212;enervated economies, defenseless and discouraged countries, disaffected populations&#8212;the remaining political elite have maintained the external trappings of virtue while failing every test of political prudence.</p><p>With bad leaders and, as Ed Feser put it, &#8220;<a href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/perfect-world-disorder">perfect world disorder</a>&#8221; before us, the temptation is strong to respond by limiting political power yet further. Sadly, such efforts will only recreate the negative feedback loop that has brought us to the present point. Slowly but surely, postliberal thinking has begun to orient the Right toward educating and fostering the qualities for good rulers&#8212;and <a href="https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=common-good-constitutionalism--9781509548866">for reconceiving political power as in the service of the common good</a>.</p><p>&#8220;Those who are equipped by nature to administer affairs,&#8221; wrote Cicero, &#8220;must abandon hesitation over winning office and engage in public life. For only in this way can either the city be ruled or greatness of spirit be displayed.&#8221;<br><br>Queen Elizabeth exhibited a lifelong dedication to office that is almost impossible to find today. But with the inspiration of her example, it can be recreated&#8212;through having offices that call forth the virtues of good rule, and through educating the young to fill them in dedication to the common good. To restore good rule, <a href="https://iusetiustitium.com/imperare-aude-dare-to-command/">we must dare to rule</a>.</p><div id="youtube2-6yDDqO4dH3c" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;6yDDqO4dH3c&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6yDDqO4dH3c?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

What is disorder? Let&#8217;s take the first question first; the answer to it will, naturally, yield an answer to the second. The classical and medieval understanding of <em>order</em> is nicely summed up in an old reference work beloved of us unreconstructed Thomists, Fr. Bernard Wuellner&#8217;s <em>Dictionary of Scholastic Philosophy</em>. &nbsp;He defines order as &#8220;the arrangement of many things into some unity according to some principle. The chief kinds are the order of parts to a whole and of means to one end.&#8221; The first of these kinds is not independent of the second. Something is part of a whole precisely by virtue of contributing to the realization of some <em>end</em> of that whole. For example, the lens is part of the eye insofar as it functions to focus the light the eye processes, where the eye in turn is part of an animal insofar as it allows it to see.</p><p>The traditional Aristotelian analysis of a thing in terms of its &#8220;four causes&#8221; provides further elucidation. The parts of a whole are its <em>material</em> cause, and their distinctive arrangement is its<em> formal</em> cause. That which brings the whole into being is its <em>efficient</em> cause, and the end for the sake of which the whole exists is its <em>final</em> cause. As Aquinas says, this end or final cause of a thing is &#8220;the cause of causes,&#8221; that which renders its other causes intelligible (<em>Summa theologiae</em> I.5.2). The lens is intelligible qua part of the eye only by reference to the end of focusing light; the eye is intelligible qua part of an animal only by reference to the end of allowing an animal to see; and so on.&nbsp;Take away the final cause, and you take away the intelligibility of the whole, and of the parts qua parts of the whole. You take away <em>order</em>.</p><p>A human being is both an order himself, and part of larger orders. In particular, and again to quote Aquinas:</p><blockquote><p>Now there should be a threefold order in man: one in relation to the rule of reason, in so far as all our actions and passions should be commensurate with the rule of reason: another order is in relation to the rule of the Divine Law, whereby man should be directed in all things: and if man were by nature a solitary animal, this twofold order would suffice. But since man is naturally a civic and social animal, as is proved in [Aristotle&#8217;s] <em>Politics</em> i, 2, hence a third order is necessary, whereby man is directed in relation to other men among whom he has to dwell.&nbsp;(<em>Summa Theologiae</em> Ia-IIae.72.4)</p></blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s consider these orders in turn, beginning with individual human beings themselves. Qua rational animals, the end toward which we are by nature directed is (according to the mainstream classical and medieval traditions) to know the <em>true</em> and the <em>good</em>. We are well-ordered to the extent that our lower appetites are subordinated to this pursuit. We are also parts of the overall cosmic order, with the existence and nature of its divine creator being the highest truths we can know, and service to him the highest good. Creation is well-ordered insofar as divine Providence works to ensure that the end for which it exists is realized, and good drawn out of even the worst evils introduced into it by disordered wills. The family is the primary manifestation of our social nature, and the state is a secondary natural manifestation. The latter&#8217;s function is to complete the meeting of our social needs by providing what smaller-scale social formations cannot, such as general law and order. &nbsp;</p><p>There are three fundamental sources of <em>disruption</em> parallel to these orders, famously known to Christian tradition as <em>the world</em>, <em>the flesh</em> and <em>the devil</em>. &#8220;The flesh&#8221; represents the most direct source of disruption to the order that is the individual human being himself. It comprises those forces that attack us from <em>within</em> ourselves&#8212;excessive or distorted passions that are insubordinate to reason, the vices that these can harden us into, and the corruption of reason itself when it becomes blind to the true and the good. &#8220;The devil,&#8221; of course, is that evil intelligence who seeks to ape God, and to disrupt the created order by turning it against the end for which it was made. &#8220;The world&#8221; represents malign forces within the social order that act to subvert it and to corrupt the individual human beings who make it up: crime; political corruption; false moral and religious ideologies; the commercialization of grave vice as with pornography, prostitution, and drug use; and so on.</p><p>Now, every order is given, by nature, a governing authority whose function it is to protect it against such disruptive forces by repressing them. Once again to quote Aquinas:</p><blockquote><p>Now it is evident that all things contained in an order, are, in a manner, one, in relation to the principle of that order. Consequently, whatever rises up against an order, is put down by that order or by the principle thereof. And because sin is an inordinate act, it is evident that whoever sins, commits an offense against an order: wherefore he is put down, in consequence, by that same order, which repression is punishment.</p><p>Accordingly, man can be punished with a threefold punishment corresponding to the three orders to which the human will is subject. In the first place a man&#8217;s nature is subjected to the order of his own reason; secondly, it is subjected to the order of another man who governs him either in spiritual or in temporal matters, as a member either of the state or of the household; thirdly, it is subjected to the universal order of the Divine government. Now each of these orders is disturbed by sin, for the sinner acts against his reason, and against human and Divine law. Wherefore he incurs a threefold punishment; one, inflicted by himself, viz. remorse of conscience; another, inflicted by man; and a third, inflicted by God.&nbsp;(<em>Summa theologiae</em> Ia-IIae.87.1)</p></blockquote><p>Because of these governing agencies, the presence of disruptive forces need not destroy an order. In a man whose rational faculties still function properly, conscience will lead him to resist the pull of the world, the flesh and the devil&#8212;or at least to repent when he has failed to resist. Hence the order that is the individual human being is maintained overall, despite the workings of these disruptive forces. In a healthy body politic, governments will repress both crime and those moral errors that are so egregious that they directly undermine the very stability of the family and the rest of the social order. And the Church, by way of her instruction, assists both individuals and governments in this task, remedying the defects in our understanding of natural law entailed by original sin.</p><p>Individual minds and governments guided by natural law are thus analogous to the body&#8217;s immune system. The immune system keeps illness at bay, or at least restores health after it has partially and temporarily been damaged. Thus the organism remains an order despite disruption to it. Similarly, the conscience of a good man, and the governance of sound public and ecclesiastical authorities, keep evil at bay, or at least suppress and correct it when it arises. Thus the individual soul and the social organism remain orderly despite the disruptive forces continually threatening them.</p><p>II.</p><p>Positive <em>dis</em>order will exist only if the governing agencies in question cease doing their job. Naturally, this is impossible in the case of divine providence. No matter what the disorder into which the rest of creation falls, providence will ensure that good is, in the long run, drawn out of it in such a way as to realize the end for which the world was made. But society and the individual human being can certainly fall into disorder. Conscience, the voice of reason, may no longer be audible to a man who has fallen into deeply habituated sin. A society can fall into anarchy by virtue of its governing authorities becoming too weak or unwilling to uphold law and order and sound morals.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg" width="1280" height="707" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:707,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:230132,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f95ac25-de9f-42c1-a4ad-7a4e23f58844_1280x707.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But this is in fact only the beginning of disorder.&nbsp;<em>Perfect</em> or <em>complete</em> disorder exists when the governing forces of an order not only fail to do their job, but act <em>positively contrary </em>to it<em>.</em> It involves a kind of <em>perversity</em>&#8212;an authority&#8217;s <em>active subversion</em> of the order it governs, its attempt to <em>frustrate</em> rather than realize the end for the sake of which the order exists. This occurs in the individual human being when his mind is in thrall to an ideology that directs him to live contrary to the natural law, and in a society when its governing institutions are dominated by such an ideology. The Church, meanwhile, cannot entirely fall into such a perversion of governance, given the divine promise that the gates of Hell will never prevail against her. But something approximating this perverse misgovernance can occur temporarily if large numbers of bishops and other churchmen fall into heresy (as has occasionally occurred in Church history, such as during the Arian crisis). &nbsp;</p><p>Worst of all would be a scenario where radical disorientation of this kind exists <em>in all of these orders at once</em>&#8212;where large numbers of individual human beings are in thrall to an ideology<em> </em>contra naturam, where the governing authorities of states and other large-scale social institutions impose this malign ideology from above, and where even many churchmen cease resisting it or even sympathize with it themselves. This would be <em>perfect world disorder</em>. (I borrow this choice phrase from the Sneaker Pimps song &#8220;Velvet Divorce.&#8221; I trust that for some this can only lend extra heft to my analysis, given the modern intellectual&#8217;s love of pop culture allusions.)</p><p>Western civilization appears currently to be approaching something like this condition. &nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/perfect-world-disorder?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/perfect-world-disorder?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="paywall-jump"></div><p>The chief manifestation and proximate cause is the sexual revolution, now reaching a culmination in gender theory&#8217;s dissolution of the very idea of male and female as objective realities. This is a subversion, first, of the order that is the individual human being.&nbsp;<a href="https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/07/psychoanalyzing-sexual-revolutionary.html">As Aquinas argued</a>, given the unique intensity of sexual pleasure, sexual immorality has, of all vices, the greatest tendency to blind the intellect and corrupt the will. And there can be no clearer evidence that one&#8217;s mind has been rotted out by disordered desire and ideology than an inability even to perceive one&#8217;s own sex, and a willingness severely to mutilate oneself in service to this delusion.</p><p>The sexual revolution subverts the social order insofar as it undermines the family, which is the basic cell of society. As a matter of natural law, sex exists for the sake of bringing children into the world, and binding together the father and mother on whom children rely to provide for and nurture them. It entails <em>self-sacrifice</em> for the sake of spouse and offspring, and in this way is the chief manifestation of our social nature.</p><p>But in the diabolical new disorder of things, sex is a matter of self-<em>fulfillment</em> and thereby made radically <em>anti</em>social. The new life it generates is frequently snuffed out in the womb rather than nurtured. An enormous number of children who are born are left fatherless, with poverty and delinquency the sequel. Others suffer the materially and psychologically destabilizing effects of divorce. Meanwhile, young people&#8217;s own sexual sensibilities are thrown into disarray by a pornified popular culture, and their minds are indoctrinated into the tenets of the sexual revolution both by this pop culture and by the educational system. The sexual act is reduced to one item among others on the menu of entertainments. Marriage is delayed indefinitely or never entered into at all. The very ideals of manhood and femininity are mocked, and replaced by the fantasy that one&#8217;s &#8220;gender&#8221; is whichever one among dozens of possibilities one imagines it to be. Chemical and surgical alterations of the body in the service of such fantasy are encouraged, ruthlessly making permanent the effects of what would otherwise be a temporary period of confusion. &nbsp;</p><p>The full support of state power, public education, and corporate influence are thrown behind this ideology of sexual liberation. The traditional conception of society as an extension of the family is effectively replaced by the model of society as a political alliance of atomized onanists. &nbsp;</p><p>And it is not just the family, but the larger social order too that is attacked. It is demonized as inherently and uniquely malign and oppressive (racist, colonialist, sexist, etc.). Its monuments are slandered as shameful idols to be torn down and destroyed. Its system of laws and those who uphold them are defamed as instruments of oppression in need of dismantling and defunding.&nbsp;Criminality is thereby facilitated and excused. Ideologues peddle &#8220;critical&#8221; theories on which the racial and other groups that make up society are inherently at odds, as oppressor and oppressed. As with the sexual revolution, these poisonous doctrines are not only not resisted by society&#8217;s governing authorities and institutions, but are embraced and actively promoted by them. It is as if our leaders have taken James Burnham&#8217;s classic book <em>Suicide of the West</em> as a &#8220;how-to&#8221; rather than a dire warning.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Church the dominant tendency is not to combat these malign developments but rather to accommodate them. Churchmen downplay, keep silent about, or in some cases even apologize for Christian moral teachings offensive to the prevailing ideologies. Where there seem to be at least verbal similarities between these ideologies and the Christian tradition&#8212;as with the language of compassion, equality before God, and so on&#8212;these are played up, while substantive differences in content are papered over. Ancient liturgical practices are held in contempt and suppressed. Persistent ambiguity and aggressive novelty demoralize the orthodox and embolden outright heresy.</p><p>III.</p><p>The <em>remote</em> cause of this perfect world disorder is the intellectual and political transformation that the West underwent beginning around the seventeenth century. Its implications have been unfolding ever since, but in recent decades have snowballed. The most fundamental element of this transformation was the abandonment of the very notion of <em>teleology </em>or final cause&#8212;in the absence of which, as I have said, the possibility of <em>order</em> disappears. Modern science, we are constantly told, revealed final cause to be an illusion. In fact it did no such thing. It simply stopped talking about it for the narrowly predictive and technological purposes of physics. But over the centuries this <em>ignoring</em> of final cause increasingly came to be treated as a <em>refutation</em> of it. On this non sequitur has modernity been constructed. (This is a story I&#8217;ve told at length elsewhere, in a semipopular way <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Superstition-Refutation-New-Atheism/dp/1587314525/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26PV27LHNYV8M&amp;keywords=feser+the+last+superstition&amp;qid=1662337297&amp;sprefix=feser+the+last+supersti%2Caps%2C303&amp;sr=8-1">here</a> and in a dryly academic manner <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aristotles-Revenge-Metaphysical-Foundations-Biological/dp/3868382003/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5R7UHOZZF3HG&amp;keywords=aristotle%27s+revenge+feser&amp;qid=1662337360&amp;sprefix=feser+arist%2Caps%2C296&amp;sr=8-1">here</a>.)</p><p>The non sequitur is embraced because of the political purposes it serves. As Pierre Manent has written of &#8220;the origins of the liberal or modern project&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p>In order to escape decisively from the power of the singular religious institution of the Church, one had to renounce thinking about human life in terms of its good or end, which would always be vulnerable to the Church&#8217;s &#8220;trump.&#8221;&nbsp;Since, therefore, power in the body politic can no longer be considered the power of the good that orders what it gives . . . man can understand himself only by creating himself. The idea of man&#8217;s self-creation characterizes the so-called Promethean ambition of modern man, who wants to be the offspring of his own works. (<em>An Intellectual History of Liberalism</em>, p. 114)</p></blockquote><p>So as to further &#8220;the construction of the new body politic, the new world of human liberty,&#8221; Manent says:</p><blockquote><p>It is the teaching of Aristotle, which was essentially adopted by Catholic doctrine, that Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, and Locke will implacably destroy. That man is a substance and onesubstance, that is the Carthago delenda of the new philosophy. (<em>The City of Man</em>, p. 113)</p></blockquote><p>Now, to deny the <em>oneness</em> or unity of man, and the <em>end</em> or final cause toward which he aims, just is to deny that man is an <em>order</em>. It is, accordingly, to erase the distinction between a <em>well</em>-ordered soul and a <em>dis</em>ordered one. Lunatic exercises in Promethean self-creation like the ones to which the sexual revolution has now led were inevitable given this revolution in thought, even if they are undoubtedly not what Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke and company had in view.</p><p>What they <em>did</em> have in immediate view was what Aquinas calls the &#8220;third order&#8221; to which man is related, the &#8220;civic and social&#8221; order. Denying final cause was essential to denying that we have obligations to a larger social order <em>by nature </em>rather than by consent.&nbsp;It was essential to modern liberalism&#8217;s project of making society a matter of <em>choice or contract</em>. But the genie could not be confined to that one bottle, and as the centuries have worn on, Promethean liberal man has gradually made<em> everything</em> a matter of choice&#8212;whether or not to kill his offspring, whether to be a man or a woman or some novel &#8220;gender&#8221; he has concocted out of a personal fetish, and in general whether to submit to natural and divine law.</p><p>Special divine punishment may follow, but it is not required to bring this disorder of things crashing down. That will happen of itself. Where supernatural action is needed is in mitigating the disaster, and ensuring an eventual restoration of order. It is only the most overarching of orders, the providential one that <em>cannot</em> fall into disorder, that can save the others. This is knowable to reason as well as to faith. In the <em>Republic</em>, Plato famously <a href="https://americanmind.org/salvo/woke-ideology-is-a-psychological-disorder/">critiques egalitarian democracy</a>, arguing that it <a href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/out-of-the-feverish-city-part-one">tends to produce disordered souls</a> dominated by the appetites, and especially by lust. Sophistry overwhelms public discourse, as even philosophers are corrupted, flattering and catering to the mob rather than calling it back to the true and the good.&nbsp;<a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1562889060602916864.html">The sequel is tyranny</a> and, humanly speaking, all is lost.&nbsp;Without divine action, virtue and true philosophy will disappear:</p><blockquote><p>The philosophic nature we have postulated . . . must in the course of its growth develop every excellence, but if it is sown and grows in unsuitable soil, the very opposite will happen, unless providence intervenes. . . .</p><p>To produce a different type of character, educated for excellence on standards different from those held by public opinion, is not, never has been, and never will be possible&#8212;in terms, that is, of human possibility, and short of a miracle as they say. For, make no mistake, to escape harm and grow up on the right lines in our present society is something that can fairly be attributed to divine providence. (pp. 214&#8211;15)</p></blockquote><p>From the Christian point of view, it is primarily through the Church, which Christ promises never to abandon, that this providential assistance is mediated. Since the Church is herself is in a bad way, the true renewal of the West awaits the renewal of the Church. But by no means does that entail that there is nothing to be done in the meantime, including at the level of politics. Effective political action will require <a href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/it-cant-happen-or-the-poverty-of">political imagination</a> beyond election cycles and partisan interests, and political success may only be piecemeal in the short run. But the crisis was centuries in the making, and so resolving it will be the work of generations. Rome is not rebuilt in a day.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/perfect-world-disorder?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/perfect-world-disorder?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saving Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[Magdalena Moncada explains why Chile rejected the world&#8217;s worst constitutional proposal]]></description><link>https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/saving-chile</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/saving-chile</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Guest Author]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 21:51:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff639474e-79c9-4df1-99b7-de7a3e1523e6_828x466.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Magdalena Moncada served as chief of staff to Jos&#233; Antonio Kast&#8217;s 2021 presidential campaign on the Partido Republicano ticket.

In 1973, GDP per capita was equivalent to $1,640; in 1990 it reached $2,490 and in 2018 it reached $15,800 USD. The poor class became a huge middle class, and the Chilean upper class prospered.</p><p>Today our country is going through a revolutionary process, which has culminated, for the moment, in a national plebiscite rejecting the proposal for a new constitution.</p><p>Chile has become an unfortunate example and warning for the countries of the world: economic prosperity will not save the West from ongoing revolution. Quite the contrary, Chile&#8217;s liberty and prosperity proved a brittle protection against the forces determined to overthrow it. The transformation of Christian societies, in Europe as well as the Americas, is a process that will not be stopped without a deep cultural work.</p><p>On September 4, 1970, in the middle of the Cold War, the socialist Salvador Allende won the elections, proposing profound reforms and a transition to Communism through socialism. His proposal was to make a revolution different from the Soviet one, one that did not require the uprising of the proletariat in revolution, but rather a change of the institutions&#8212;the law, the justice system and the Congress&#8212;so that they would adapt to the reforms that the presidency wanted to promote.</p><p>The three years of Allende&#8217;s government were marked by several elements: a single national educational program, which would restrict the freedom of education; the expropriation of large rural property, seeking to put an end to agricultural economic concentrations; the nationalization of copper mining, the main economic activity of the country; and the extensive visit of the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, icon of the Communist revolution. By 1973, the economic and social situation in Chile was unsustainable, with uncontrolled inflation and food shortages that produced malnutrition and hunger. The political division reached the point of institutional breakdown, the president broke the law to carry out reforms not approved by the Congress and in contempt of the Chilean Supreme Court rulings that condemned his illegitimacy. </p><p>Chilean revolutionary cells&#8212;called MIR, MAPU and FPMR&#8212;sought to achieve by armed means what President Allende could not achieve with his reforms. Rumors of a civil war increased, which led the president to appoint a cabinet made up of members of the Armed Forces. Finally, on September 11, 1973, the presidential palace was bombed and President Allende took his own life, initiating a military government of General Pinochet that came to the rescue of a country that was on the verge of civil war. Pinochet&#8217;s government that would finally last till March 11, 1990.</p><p>The revolutionary cells that had been actively functioning in Chile during the Allende government, and that threatened civil war, were quashed, and during the military government the country grew economically. The Chilean right wing thought it had left behind the socialist dreams of revolutionary transformation of the state, given what seemed to be the empirical evidence of the superiority of the free market model against the centrally planned one.</p><p>The seeds of the coming problem, however, lay exactly in this liberal way of thinking: the view that economic welfare was a sufficiently forceful answer at the cultural and civilizational level. It never was. Many left-wing theorists had already concluded that, in the midst of economic wealth and the welfare of a country, a revolution could arise in a new revolutionary subject&#8212;no longer in the proletarian class, which had since become accommodated to the middle class with access to goods and services. The new revolutionary subject found the reason for its dissatisfaction on the psychological plane, as oppressed and relegated minorities, who find the impetus for their desire for social transformation in a much deeper root than the economic one: the cultural one.</p><p>Ideology entered our country in torrents. Well-known public figures pushed the study of homosexuality as well as trans and queer lifestyles. Anarchist groups inserted themselves in vulnerable neighborhoods; self-determination found a new place in radical indigenist thought, and the oppression of indigenous populations became a pretext for developing terrorism in the south of the country. Decolonization came on the scene to abolish the European model of nationhood that founded Chile, and feminism sought to radicalize Chilean women toward a society without family and even without gender.</p><p>The rise of terrorism in Chile has been underreported in Western media. The first terrorist attack by the &#8220;CAM&#8221; terrorist cell took place in 1990, in the Alaskan ranch. Since then the number has not stopped rising: in 2016, 20 attacks; in 2017, 64; in 2018, 157; in 2019, 415; and in 2020, 808 attacks and rising every year, with more than 50 murders. </p><p>Regarding religious faith and family, in 1996 80 percent of the Chilean population declared themselves Catholic; by 2017, that figure dropped to 37 percent. This decline was cemented in law, which in turn exacerbated the underlying problems: the divorce law was approved in 2004, in 2017 the abortion law with restrictions, and finally this year, same-sex marriage. </p><p>Marijuana consumption went from 4.6 percent in 2010 to 30 percent in 2016 among adults. Regarding alcohol consumption, we have the highest in Latin America. 23 percent of Chileans have or are thought to have some mental health problem. The average age of first sexual activity is 16/17 years old. In 2019, 75 percent of children were born out of wedlock, and our birth rate is at 1.6 children per woman.</p><p>For decades, from 1990 through today, an intense revolutionary ferment has been under way: anger and class hatred have been stoked, incentivized in economic inequality; the Church and morality were attacked, in a pretension to modify that which was always considered good and true; mockery of the homeland and its symbols was encouraged, toward the rejection of tradition and culture; and violent behavior began to emerge among youth, indications of a future uprising that would become real on October 18, 2019.</p><p>The insurrection of 2019 was the manifestation of what had been simmering for decades. The saturation of social space with radical ideological slogans suddenly encouraged rapid social collapse. This discontent was promoted in universities, schools, workers&#8217; unions, vulnerable neighborhoods, among minorities of all kinds as well as among feminist collectives. A widespread uprising, they thought, would demonstrate to the right-wing political class, so oblivious to this revolutionary reality, that Chile was a very different country from the one they imagined.</p><p>The widespread chaos lasted for months. Between October 2019 and March 2020, 34 people died as a result of the protests, 25 subway stations were set on fire, more than 2,000 crime reports were filed, carabineros reported 544 attacks on their barracks, 73 percent of the shops in the affected areas had to close during those months, 600 businesses closed permanently, and 57 churches were vandalized in two months&#8212;51 of them Catholic.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:404711,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d666ac-7d34-4193-b706-465e209e9bd4_2520x1680.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Rioters destroy St. Francis Borgia Church in Santiago, October 2020.</em></p><p>In an attempt to calm this widespread lawlessness, President Sebasti&#225;n Pi&#241;era made an agreement with almost the entire political spectrum&#8212;except for the right-wing Partido Republicano or Republican Party&#8212;to change the Constitution. The proposal, however, was a misreading of our reality all too typical for right-wing liberals. </p><p>In the first place, the newly proposed constitution, now thankfully rejected, would have involved something much deeper than a constitutional change. Secondly, the social needs that need to be improved in Chile do not require constitutional modifications. And finally, opening the possibility of consecrating new constitutional rights to the radicalized Left, and of investing new ideological concepts with supralegal authority, opened a new political scenario that our country will hardly be able to revert in the medium term.</p><p>The constitutional proposal now rejected was born of a process that despised our country. The text of constitutional change presented to the people was, sadly, a faithful reflection of this process of cultural and philosophical collapse.</p><p>The proposed new constitution would have removed all mention of the family as the nucleus of society, while consecrating diverse families as legitimate. It proposed, as constitutional rights, abortion without limits and for any reason; the right to euthanasia; the right to trans identity which cannot be questioned or denied by others, not even in private virtual spaces. The new constitution demanded gender parity, with quotas, in all state bodies and in all elections at national and local level.</p><p>A plural nationality was also envisioned by the new constitution, putting an end to Chilean unity and presenting divisions and racial discrimination in favor of indigenous peoples. It would have limited the action of the Armed Forces to stop the rampant Chilean terrorism. It would have ended the freedom of educational projects, subordinating all schools and universities to mandatory ideological principles. It gave the right to vote to all prisoners in Chile, regardless of the crime committed or the time they must spend in jail. In short, it intended to consecrate a truly insane, divisive and ideological constitution, representative of the culturally revolutionary process that Chile has been living.</p><p>Nonetheless, the task that remains is gigantic. Four million eight hundred thousand people approved a project that intended to end religious liberty and educational liberty, limit private property and ended the right to life. A third of Chile proposes and wishes to make profound changes to our democracy&#8212;and are ashamed of our history.</p><p>In spite of the resounding defeat of this constitution, the vote is not an electoral process that will alone be able to change Chile towards a better future. Rejection of the new constitution is not the triumph of a right-wing president, or a turn to the right in Congress. The need we have today is to be able to confront the radical Left that has taken over the new generations. We need a return to our traditions and customs, a strengthening of the family and life, the defense of religion, parental educational freedom and shared economic success, among other values.</p><p>The share of hope that remains for Chile is to change course. Chile needs new leadership, with enough education to face today&#8217;s problem at a philosophical as well as practical level, with a sense of reality and true social concern&#8212;a generation of courageous people that will raise our country that once was a country of opportunities and meritocracy. We need in Chile, and throughout the world, a generation that rescues the value principles that founded our society&#8212;a generation that is full of pride in our history and our faith&#8212;a generation that can lead with confidence, humility, and full knowledge of the catastrophic consequences of the rejection of human nature.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Deal for Labor Day ]]></title><description><![CDATA[We&#8217;re cutting our annual subscription rate in half this weekend in honor of the American Worker.]]></description><link>https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/a-new-deal-for-labor-day</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/a-new-deal-for-labor-day</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The Postliberals]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 04:01:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_256,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62788117-41d1-4727-8ed6-3908168bf923_708x708.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the end of the 19th century, industrialization had ravaged &#8220;the condition of the working class.&#8221; Capital expansion often entailed the abuse of ordinary workers, and consequently there were numerous movements which arose to remedy the plight of the common laborer. Trade unionism, and various labor movements formed. </p><p>In response, Pope Leo XIII wrote <em>Rerum Novarum </em>on the rights and duties of capital and labor in 1891:</p><blockquote><p>some opportune remedy must be found quickly for the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class: for the ancient workingmen's guilds were abolished in the last century, and no other protective organization took their place. Public institutions and the laws set aside the ancient religion. Hence, by degrees it has come to pass that working men have been surrendered, isolated and helpless, to the hardheartedness of employers and the greed of unchecked competition. The mischief has been increased by rapacious usury, which, although more than once condemned by the Church, is nevertheless, under a different guise, but with like injustice, still practiced by covetous and grasping men. To this must be added that the hiring of labor and the conduct of trade are concentrated in the hands of comparatively few; so that a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Against a &#8220;socialist&#8221; solution &#8212; &#8220;private ownership is in accord with natural law&#8221; &#8212;Pope Leo proposed that only a proper and classical concern with justice would do. The rights and responsibilities of all classes demand recognition, and in defense of this recognition he gave the Church&#8217;s blessing to the labor movement in the interest of &#8220;a family wage,&#8221; wherein capital would recognize that they were responsible not simply for the expansion of profits but for the support and expansion of the human family. In this way, the Leonine vision was deeply &#8220;familist&#8221; &#8212; making the flourishing of the family at the heart of any just intervention to correct the abuses of capital. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=ee30cf79&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 50% off for 1 year&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=ee30cf79"><span>Get 50% off for 1 year</span></a></p><p>Three years later, in America, Labor Day became a Federal Holiday.

The authors of the study sought to understand the factors causing &#8220;one of the most important economic and demographic issues of our time,&#8221; and they found that very little provided an explanation for the rise in despair, with one glaring exception: a decline in religious practice was highly correlative since the late 1990s, following a steep downturn in &#8220;religious adherence&#8221; (presumably the collapse of mainline Protestantism) in the late 1980s. Using the General Social Survey, the authors find that this had a disproportional effect on the poor, and especially on &#8220;white middle-aged Americans without a college degree.&#8221; One can immediately see that the class of people most affected by religious decline are those who lack all the social and economic &#8220;buffers&#8221; of the middle and upper classes. One might even speculate that those most affected by the rise in deaths of despair and the decline of Christian devotion would gravitate toward any political candidate who could offer some hope of reversing their despair. </p><p>Yet the most powerful aspect of the study, especially for readers of <em>Postliberal Order</em>, is that the authors track the rising despair and the decline of religion most precisely to <em>the repeal of blue laws.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>

The &#8220;conservative&#8221; aspect of this comes in the right-liberal&#8217;s espousal of socially conservative views on abortion, transgenderism, etc. On the other side, those weary of liberalism&#8217;s perceived failures have gathered under the banner of postliberalism, advocating instead for a common-good approach to politics that focuses less on individual civil liberties and more on the very nature of liberty.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>The means of actualizing this political vision, many postliberals argue, is the intervention of the administrative state into the social and economic realm in order to create conditions conducive to the common good, making it harder to pursue vice, and easier to pursue virtue. This entails a reconsideration of the individual &#8220;freedoms&#8221; often used to prevent restrictions on harmful or false public expression, such as freedom of speech, academia, or religion. To the dismay of right-liberals, this vision of a postliberal society has been blazing trails in academia and public culture, winning territory in the minds and hearts of young conservatives across the West&#8212;and it shows no signs of slowing any time soon.</p><p>Yet the vast majority of self-identifying &#8220;conservative&#8221; Americans still espouse right-liberal principles. In its 2021 &#8220;American values&#8221; <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/competing-visions-of-america-an-evolving-identity-or-a-culture-under-attack/">survey</a>, the Public Religion Research Institute&#8212;a nonpartisan research organization&#8212;compiled data on the variety of cultural and political views held by Americans. In response to a question asking whether support for individual liberty, respect for American political institutions, and acceptance of religious pluralism are required to be a &#8220;true American,&#8221; the affirmative was offered by 98, 96, and 92 percent of Republicans respectively. Meanwhile, Tuft&#8217;s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement has found similarly liberal views amongst young Republicans. For example, <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/young-republicans-young-trump-voters-and-future-gop">around</a> 41 percent of the youth who voted for Trump did so on the basis of &#8220;jobs and economy.&#8221; While Trump&#8217;s economic policy platform includes some postliberal themes, his policies on deregulation and tax cuts were staunchly liberal, and this reflects a broader problem: the Republican party&#8212;for the most part&#8212;has not signed on to the postliberal project.</p><p>This stubborn fealty to liberalism displayed by many on the right is a curious phenomenon&#8212;especially considering that the liberal order seems to have failed to uphold social conservatism. A gloss of the current situation reveals a dire future. Freedom of speech, religion, and press&#8212;rather than encouraging dialogue oriented toward the truth&#8212;has blurred the concept of &#8220;truth&#8221; itself. In the vast marketplace of ideas, the notion that one worldview is true and another false is seen as philosophically reductive or restrictive upon one&#8217;s freedom of conscience. Pledges toward small government and free market values have relegated the prospect of single-income families to the realm of fantasy. Fair price, condemnation of usury, or virtually any other principle traditionally considered necessary for a just, flourishing society have been disregarded as financially disastrous. Beyond the metrics of ideology and economy, one may find several more examples of concerning trends. In the end, even if conservatives disagree on the extent of modern society&#8217;s decline, there is no shortage of evidence that it <em>is</em> in decline. </p><p>One would have expected the right-liberals to have abandoned ship by now for something more promising and ambitious than the slow progressive burn of the status quo. Postliberalism offers that alternative, one girded by millennia of rich political philosophy and religious tradition. And yet, many right-liberals have responded to the postliberal vision with a peculiar derision. Dialogue between the two groups usually dissolves in the same way. The right-liberal is scandalized by any laudatory mention of the &#8220;administrative state,&#8221; or is shocked at any skepticism toward individual liberty as an absolute political good. Basic postliberal categories about political order send the right-liberal into fits of rage over authoritarianism and tyranny, while accusations of utopian idealism fall unfailing and unthinkingly from their lips. Before long, the right-liberal is rallying charges against the postliberalist project as &#8220;impossible in the real world,&#8221; &#8220;dangerous if ever actually implemented,&#8221; or&#8212;in a truly vitriolic turn&#8212;perhaps even &#8220;un-American.&#8221;</p><p>Indeed, every vocal postliberal has heard this critique, and every vocal right-liberal has posited something of the sort before. In the space of a few short years, we have come to see the predictable pantomime response play out. But there is a source to this pattern of instinctive incredulity. The habitual and uniform response to the postliberal worldview is emblematic of right-liberalism&#8217;s most powerful weapon&#8212;one that is more effective than any metaphysical argument, appeal to tradition, or rhetorical flourish. This weapon is, by nature, elusive and subtle; it decisively destroys any temptation toward integralist sentiment and banishes any doubt regarding the institutional structure of the status quo. It is a weapon of psychology: more precisely, it is a mindset that, with the speed and force of instinct, translates conceptions of the integralist vision to images of &#8220;authoritarianism,&#8221; &#8220;utopianism,&#8221; and other disquieting or laughable notions. This weapon is the conservative panopticon. Allow me to explain.</p><p>Readers will recall that it is Michel Foucault who most effectively outlined the concept of psychological panopticism. To be clear, Foucault is no paragon of virtue, nor can we commend his philosophy as wisdom. However, his analysis of &#8220;panopticism&#8221; offers an important account of how ideas are regulated within the individual&#8217;s psyche.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg" width="1170" height="1182" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1182,&quot;width&quot;:1170,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:374234,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4196ee-49a2-4190-aa87-1d8900139997_1170x1182.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, Foucault recalls the penitentiary model of English philosopher Jeremy Bentham, the liberal progenitor of classical utilitarianism, who designed this model in order to maximize efficiency of resources used to operate prisons. Bentham theorizes a prison in which prisoners, housed in cells lined up side-by-side around multiple circular floors, can be watched by guards behind a wall. This wall, however, inhibits the prisoners from seeing the guards. Consequently, Bentham contends, even if there is no guard present, the prisoners will begin to police their own behavior out of fear that a guard may be present. Foucault uses this model as an analogy for the psychological apparatus of the modern disciplinary State, wherein man has internalized certain self-regulatory norms out of fear of the possible judgment of society. For a more light-hearted example, almost everyone washes their hands after using the restroom. A significant portion of these regular hand-washers, however, would not appeal to hygiene as the explicit reason for their action. Sure, this is most likely a reason, but the sense of shame that results from not having washed one&#8217;s hands is also a prominent reason. Interestingly, this self-regulating shame arises even when one may be certain that no one is watching. Foucault would describe this as an example of the internalized panoptic psychology of the modern world, where power is not wielded solely by the State but also in social relation.</p><p>Now, one may easily accept this analysis as an ethical dictum, repudiate all forms of self-regulation, and board the Foucauldian train hurtling toward the abyss of libertinism and debauchery. The twenty-first century, still reeling from the residual effects of the sexual revolution, is evidence that such a pursuit will only lead to despair and self-destruction. Nonetheless, Foucault&#8217;s analysis is not entirely useless. Returning to the subject at hand, the right-liberal &#8220;policing&#8221; of postliberalism reveals itself as panoptic in essence. Why is the State&#8217;s increased involvement in public affairs <em>instinctively</em> seen as inherently authoritarian? Why is a more technocratic form of rule <em>instinctively</em> perceived as inherently despotic? Why are the immense benefits and intrinsic safeguards of such models of governance rarely taken into account? It is as if the modern liberal retains a sense of internalized shame and discomfort toward power and authority, as if these concepts are tinted with intrinsically negative valences in the psyche of the individual. In the grand scheme of the conservative panopticon, the modern right-liberal regulates himself against integralist temptations via conflation of &#8220;illiberalism&#8221; and &#8220;authoritarianism.&#8221;</p><p>Who are the guards sustaining this self-regulating, panoptic political psychology? They are none other than the ghosts of the founders who live on today in America&#8217;s inherited liberal order. Fear of contravening the American patrimony has instigated Americans to internalize the early Republic&#8217;s modus vivendi: insistence on the right to self-determination, ideological and religious pluralism, and separation of powers are exemplary of the limitation on power and authority cherished by the founders. As with prisoners subconsciously trained into moral self-policing, right-liberals have developed an ideological gag reflex against the means of America&#8217;s salvation.</p><p>The immediate rejoinder to this critique is, of course, some reference to Hitler, Stalin, or Mussolini. The right-liberal might argue that his aversion to the integralist project is grounded not in psychological self-affirmation but in history, in the reality that employing political power in the culture wars opens the floodgates to potentially despicable and destructive leaders. And yet this invocation is itself a functioning of the panopticon. Examples of Cyrus, Ashoka, Marcus Aurelius, Constantine, Justinian, Charlemagne, Louis IX, Peter I, Frederick II, Lincoln, and others are swept under the rug in the debate over the question of sovereignty. These men were certainly not perfect, but they are counterexamples to the predominant narrative that power may only be exercised unto the destruction of society. Instead, with its looming projection of twentieth century fascism, the conservative panopticon burns a false image of sovereignty into the minds of men, redirecting their gaze only to its failures and away from its successes. The result is a conservative establishment that rejects illiberal ideas primarily on the basis of a self-imposed distaste rather than deliberate cost-benefit analysis. This is not to say, of course, that abuses of state power should be ignored in the debate over the merits of postliberalism. On the contrary, it is the historical myopia of the liberal gentry that ought to be discarded.</p><p>In the meanwhile, progressives&#8212;free from the strictures of a pantopic political philosophy&#8212;have unabashedly pursued political power with evangelistic zeal. For centuries, right-liberals have championed &#8220;political prudence&#8221; and &#8220;legislative temperance&#8221; in order to justify their aversion toward using the state to influence culture. Too much government involvement might, they argue, engender resentment amongst the people by unduly limiting the liberty necessary for a happy populus. Moreover, government is simply inept: the welfare state, for example, has completely failed to lift millions of Americans out of poverty and has instead made them dependent upon taxpayer-funded handouts. In a word, the state is an ineffective instrument whose overreach would undermine the well-being of the people. And yet, over the past century, progressives have managed to use the bureaucracy, the legislature, and the judiciary to shift cultural norms&#8212;without the ramifications predicted by right-liberals. The reevaluation of foreign policy along lines of progressive social ideology; the loosening of immigration restrictions through Congress; landmark decisions like <em>Griswold v. Texas</em>, <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em>, and, until recently, <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. Contrary to the cautionary tales of conservative liberals, the intervention of the State in these cultural and moral matters has been neither ineffective nor has it introduced widespread popular instability. Rather, progressive values have been steadily gathering more <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/december/america-more-liberal-than-50-years-ago-but-change-not-reflected-.html">influence</a> and the people have adapted to these political norms as pupils to a teacher. Progressives have written the handbook and demonstrated it to be efficacious; it would be foolish for conservatives to burn it on the basis of a false &#8220;temperance.&#8221;</p><p>Moreover, &#8220;conservatives&#8221; must wake up to see that they simply cannot afford to abandon the state and retreat into red states, little platoons, and gated communities. The political reality is that progressivism now wields power and influence over every level of society: against the scorched-earth policy of the Left, the &#8220;conservative&#8221; canard of &#8220;grassroots cultural revival&#8221; stands no chance without a comparable political counterweight. The right-liberal can &#8220;stand athwart&#8221; yelling stop all they want. The Left advances by securing power. Their libraries host drag queen story hours, their schools transgender ideology, and their churches preach relativistic theologies which turn love in upon itself. And this is because they dare to rule, and conservatives do not.</p><p>G. K. Chesterton once wrote, &#8220;War is not the best way of settling differences; it is the only way of preventing their being settled for you.&#8221; Unless right-liberals enter the battlefield of political power and exercise the State unto the proliferation of virtue, the war for the American conscience will be settled on the wrong side by the wrong people&#8212;quicker than conservatives could shout &#8220;But that&#8217;s not what the Founders wanted!&#8221;</p><p>Yet this much should be obvious. So what has prevented American conservatives from putting up a fight? What keeps them returning to the status quo ante? Why have we not yet abandoned our pacifying libertarianism? The rationale cannot be political prudence, for virtue can do no evil. Neither is it political deliberation, for reason can promote no falsehood.</p><p>I&#8217;ve come to think that the culprit behind the conservative reticence toward new &#8220;illiberal&#8221; ideas is none other than the psychological policing-role conservatives have accepted within the collapsing liberal order&#8212;what I&#8217;ve called the political panopticon.</p><p>The solution is to break out of the role. Break out of the guardhouse of the right-liberal panopticon. Break out of the habits that cause the conservative to mindlessly repeat accusations of &#8220;authoritarianism&#8221; and &#8220;utopianism&#8221; at every postliberal turn of phrase. We need a new path, uniting under a common banner: one of a strong State, a common good politics, and an ambitious <a href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/it-cant-happen-or-the-poverty-of?s=r&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">political imagination</a>.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p>The only way forward is to begin from scratch, to scrutinize liberal presuppositions regarding power with thoroughness and probity.

Like Athens, the Roman world was suffused with religious rites, shrines, altars, and narratives about the movements of the gods in human affairs.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Augustine grows up between two worlds, one pagan and one Christian &#8212; perfectly represented by his pagan father Patrick, and his Christian mother Monica. In his famous account of his conversion, he confesses his errors and sins, and says that they were like sacrifices offered to demons on the interior altar of his heart. This analogy is apt because Augustine is profoundly aware that what binds the soul and the city together is religion, sacrifice, worship, the interior gaze, who or what orients our action. Since he lives in a world where pagan shrines abound alongside the shrines of saints and martyrs, it is easier to see that these exterior altars of the city correspond to the interior altar of the human soul.&nbsp;</p><p>After the sack of Rome in 410, many elite Romans who had never accepted the Christianization of the empire from Constantine to Theodosius, had charged that Rome was falling precisely because Christ and His Church had usurped the place of the ancestral gods. Augustine writes his magisterial City of God precisely against these charges &#8212; as the original title reflects, <em>De Civitate Dei <strong>Contra Paganos</strong>.</em></p><p>Augustine initially responds that during the sack of Rome, pagans and Christians alike found shelter not in pagan shrines but in the great basilicas of the apostles and martyrs of Jesus Christ. Far from being bad from Rome, Augustine immediately retorts that it is the Church alone which gave sanctuary to Romans in their time of need &#8212; the Church brings not only eternal but also temporal, material benefits for the people of Rome. Indeed, his argument echoes throughout history, namely that <em>the Catholic Church remains the sole bulwark and makeweight of Western civilization.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/out-of-the-feverish-city-part-two?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/out-of-the-feverish-city-part-two?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Against the accusations of elites, Augustine argues that Rome&#8217;s fall is due to a corruption of the Roman soul that has been mediated by the gods of the city. Rome&#8217;s problem is at root a religious problem. Indeed, Plato&#8217;s own way out of the feverish city fails because while Plato may banish the bad religion of the poets, and while the philosopher-king may contemplate the true God, Platonism lacks the very means of uniting people to God. </p><p>So Augustine narrates Rome&#8217;s history from the vantage point of her &#8220;gaze&#8221; &#8212; always mindful of the Platonic resonance. What is it that Rome most admires, adores, and worships? And how does this shape the &#8220;public thing&#8221; (<em>res publica</em>) that is Rome?&nbsp; In this sense, he is asking an essential Socratic or Platonic question: what is the relationship between contemplation and action? If Rome seems in dire straits, if it&#8217;s actions are decadent, inclining towards self-destruction, it stands to reason that this has its root in how Romans see their highest good, and their Final End. It has its roots in what orients their interior altar. <br><br>It&#8217;s for this reason that Augustine repeatedly uses the Latin word &#8216;<em>spectare</em>&#8217; &#8212; which is usually translated as spectacle. Anyone with a passing understanding of Augustine knows that he is highly critical of the Roman games and the stage plays of the theatre. These are &#8220;spectacles&#8221; &#8212; to which we might nod our heads and say to ourselves, &#8220;yeah, the grammies are really awful.&#8221; But the brutality of the games, and the debauchery of the theatre were very obviously suffused with religion (by the way, our spectacles are also suffused with religion even if we are not always attentive to this). Both the games and the theatre were not only circuses which entertained and thus formed the people, but they focused the Roman gaze on the very immorality of the city&#8217;s gods. Roman theatre held up the immorality of the gods as either humorous or tragic, but Augustine said that the Roman soul is deformed by these spectacles not because he is against games, or the theatre, but because he is against how these spectacles shape the soul and the city alike. In this sense, consistent with the Platonic insight about &#8220;men who are like their regimes,&#8221; but now &#8220;men who are like what they gaze upon,&#8221; or &#8220;men who are like their gods.&#8221; <em>We become what we contemplate.</em> <br><br>Augustine personalizes the effect that Roman spectacle had upon him.&nbsp; &#8220;When I was a young man I used to go to sacrilegious shows and entertainments. I watched the antics of madmen; I listened to singing boys; I thoroughly enjoyed the most degrading spectacles put on in the honor of gods and goddesses &#8212; in honor of the Heavenly Virgin, and of Brecynthia, mother of all.&#8221; (2.5)&nbsp;In other words, Augustine knows the Roman &#8220;gaze&#8221; from experience, and recalls the verbal and sexual obscenities performed in the theater and in the city. The goddess cults demand that men castrate themselves, sometimes with rocks, in order to serve at the altar of fertility. Priestesses perform sexually degrading rites that in a domestic context would be unacceptable, but which is acceptable because the gods demand it. He asks &#8220;who could fail to realize what kind of spirits they are who could enjoy such obscenities?&#8221; The gods of the theater and the city are not friends of our souls, and they are not friends of Rome. Only someone who refused to recognize that these spectacles were created by unclean spirits who, masquerading as gods, deceive men into thinking that the Roman soul was not being directed by a &#8220;depraved cult. This notion of spectacle, then, is critical for understanding Augustine&#8217;s argument.<br><br>Elite Romans were often not as attached to the gods as the people of Rome &#8212; even though they regarded the gods as essential to the glory of Rome. Some Roman elites held an attitude not dissimilar from Plato&#8217;s &#8220;noble lie,&#8221; the view that there were no actual gods, but that they served a kind of pedagogical social function, or they were useful for binding a diverse and far-flung empire together.&nbsp;</p><p>Augustine asks these tolerant Roman elites why they tolerate having &#8220;temples to demons where Galli are mutilated, eunuchs are consecrated, madmen gash themselves, and every other kind of cruelty or perversion&#8221;? (2.7)<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> The gods, and the plays which were largely about them, had a hold on the public imagination. Romans are captivated by spectacles which spout lies, cruelties, and obscenities which are all intimately ordered to the gods. Their souls had become like their religion &#8212; so why does it not occur to Roman elites that the problem might not be Christianity, but with Rome&#8217;s own gods, who are nothing other than human inventions puffed up by demons? Augustine commends them to read Plato, who at least had the good sense to &#8220;banish poets from his city to prevent their misleading the citizens, with the divinity of the gods who demand stage plays in their honor.&#8221; (2.14). Such&nbsp;spectacles direct the Roman soul&#8212;and &#8220;the most depraved desires&#8221; of the human heart are given a &#8220;kind of divine authority.&#8221; (2.14) And so it follows that just as men may be like their regimes, so the city may become a reflection of the human soul. </p><p>He cites their own &#8220;best men&#8221; on this point to ensure that they know that the critique comes not just from without but from within. Augustine cites Sallust on the moral deterioration he witnessed after the Civil Wars between the <em>plebs</em> and the <em>patres</em>, noting that after that time &#8220;the degradation of traditional morality ceased to be a gradual decline and became a torrential downhill rush.&nbsp; The young were so corrupted by luxury and greed that it was justly observed that a generation had arisen which could neither keep its own property or allow others to keep theirs.&#8221; (2.18)<br><br>Augustine sets out his thesis very clearly before Roman readers when he writes: Rome had sunk into a morass of moral degradation before the coming of our Heavenly King. For all this happened not only before Christ had begun to teach in the flesh, but even before he had been born of a virgin. &#8220; (2.18).&nbsp;</p><p>The Bishop will not allow the roman elites the luxury of blaming their decline on christianity.&nbsp; He forces them to face their history squarely, through their own revered authorities and histories.&nbsp; It is not only a defense of the City of God, it is an examination of the Roman conscience. Not only did their gods not protect the Roman people, they guaranteed their &#8220;torrential downhill rush&#8221; into immorality, leading Rome down the metaphysical scale into the pit of self-destruction. &#8220;There you see the Roman republic changing from the height of excellence [virtue] to the depths of depravity.&#8221; (2.19)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As he puts it, &#8220;the worshippers and lovers of those gods &#8220; imitate their &#8220;criminal wickedness,&#8221; and are &#8220;unconcerned about the utter corruption of their country.&#8221; (2.20) Imitation thus remains central for thinking about the relation of the soul to the city: men who are like their regimes, and regimes who are like their gods.&nbsp;</p><p>Augustine rails against the way in which materialism and libertine hedonism in Rome are simply a human performance of the debauchery of the gods. Romans based their moral code only in &#8220;consent,&#8221; and as Aristotle understood, this consent-based morality fuses the Oligarchic and Democratic Man into one great tyranny built upon Lust. He summarizes Rome&#8217;s radical libertinism thusly: &#8220;get as rich as you can, and let people do whatever they desire as long as there is consent.&#8221; (2.20) But consent-based morality develops into a society turned in on itself, and tends to punish anyone who speaks for a higher, more transcendent standard.&nbsp;</p><p>As if speaking for many Christians in our late liberal empire today, Augustine laments that to stand opposed to this bad-religion because of the disorder it introduces into the soul and city alike invites only derision, cancellation, exile.&nbsp; He writes, &#8220;Anyone who disapproves of this kind of happiness should rank as a public enemy: anyone who attempts to change it or get rid of it should be hustled out of hearing by the freedom-loving majority: he should be kicked out, and removed from the land of the living.&#8221; (2.20) <br><br>So far, so devastating. Rome is enslaved by bad religion which has disoriented their interior altars by the deceptions of demons.&nbsp;</p><p>Augustine destroys the gods of the theatre, and the gods of the city. He leaves intact the philosophers who are lovers of wisdom. Roman philosopher-statesmen like Cicero are praised for directing Rome to that &#8220;complete justice&#8221; which is &#8220;the supreme essential for government.&#8221; (2.21) Cicero sees that a republic should be bound together by a common sense of what is right &#8212; which is to say a shared view of the common good &#8212; and bound by the common interests, loves, and ends. But Cicero laments that instead the republic has fallen far from this standard. Cicero says in Scipio&#8217;s voice: &#8220;What remains of that ancient morality which...supported the Roman state? We see that it has passed out of use into oblivion, so that far from being cultivated, it does not even enter our minds...We retain the name of a commonwealth, but we have lost the reality long ago; and this was not through any misfortunate, but through our own misdemeanors.&#8221;</p><p>There was the &#8220;fancy picture&#8221; of the glory of Rome, and then there was the degraded reality evident to all of Rome&#8217;s greatest men. By the end of book two of the City of God, Augustine returns to the importance of the gaze. He writes that Rome had not been formed by the fancy picture it had of itself, but rather it has been formed by Roman spectacle, by &#8220;acts presented before all men&#8217;s eyes for imitation, to put forward for them to gaze at.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>So what is all of the reflection on &#8220;spectacle&#8221; all about? Remember Plato&#8217;s philosopher-king. Can their purified &#8220;gaze&#8221; lead us out of the feverish city? Can their contemplation of the eternal form of the City not lead to a purification Rome? Now we come to the central question.</p><p>Augustine admires the Platonists, and especially the Neo-Platonists of the Roman world. Unlike Cicero or Varro, who collapse God into the soul of the world, the Platonists truly order their gaze the transcendent God &#8212; the Final End, Supreme Being above all being, the Wisdom of God.&nbsp;</p><p>Socrates had taught that the soul must be purified to enjoy the contemplative vision of the One cause of all. But the Platonists tolerate the gods, because they are still too impure to be united to their Cause. Even the philosopher-king cannot purify Rome because they cannot purify themselves of sim and ignorance.&nbsp;</p><p>Only Jesus Christ can purify the soul, and so unite us to the eternal city.&nbsp;</p><p>So it&#8217;s not enough to simply &#8220;banish the poets&#8221; and get the right kings The only way to crush false religion is privilege true religion, and to ensure that the ruler, or rulers, have the &#8220;right sort of worship.&#8221; The only way to safeguard the soul and the city from the torrential downhill rush into decay and immorality is to redirect the rulers&#8217; interior and exterior gaze to Christ.&nbsp;</p><p>Augustine ends the second book of the City by contrasting the degrading gaze to the elevating Christian vision which raises people up to the most glorious city of God. There is the yoke of &#8220;polluted powers&#8221; from which Rome must be freed. &#8220;The Christian purge,&#8221; as Bettenson has it, could also be understood as Augustine&#8217;s aim in the whole work: to hold up the necessity of Christian purification for the whole Roman world. This is the view that succeeded the Platonic vision, and it reigned supreme in the West for more than a thousand years. </p><p>Today, we see that the gods of the theatre and the city have come back with a vengeance. So too have the gods of Oligarchy, Democracy, and Tyranny &#8212; circling souls around a new false faith, set on destroying God and the image of God.&nbsp;We inhabit a feverish city, and there seems to be no escaping it. </p><p>Many have written about the Great Awokening, as something which both taps into America&#8217;s Puritan and Evangelical traditions &#8212; but which represents something like a new civic religion to replace the old, more consciously Christian civil religion. We see the new solemnities everywhere we look. The positivist Auguste Comte was foolish to introduce a rationally mapped out calendar for France &#8212; he should have rolled out the new holidays one by one by getting corporations to celebrate them.</p><p>Cancel culture is but a mechanism for establishing new solemnities, and redirecting the soul&#8217;s gaze. In order to exchange one civic religion for another, one must exhile, or cancel all the old images of the person, of marriage, of sexual difference, of family. You need to break the bonds of old loves in order to forge new ones in the civic soul.&nbsp;</p><p>Today we regularly see images that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. We now regularly see images of men dressed as women who ascribe disordered desires even to children who they treat as sexual objects during their Drag Queen Story Hours at the local library &#8212; ever increasing levels of disorder &#8220;normalized&#8221; as spectacles for public consumption. These are the new priests and priestesses like those of Galli, and they are forming souls to be like that self-destructive city which pulls down the ramparts.&nbsp;</p><p>The feverish city purports to celebrate &#8220;equality and human dignity of all people,&#8221; but the claim is incoherent. The equality of human beings can only be affirmed if we have some objective standard in which we are all the same &#8212; in which we are all hold something in common. Yet, the city of pride, which celebrates itself this month, doesn&#8217;t have a theology fit for the recognition of equal dignity. That would require an anthropology that understood that each of us were &#8220;equal&#8221; by virtue of our common cause, and that our dignity was elevatable according to the end and purpose for which we have been made. What the city of pride celebrates, however, is an anthropology of transgressive difference which cannot celebrate God as prior to us, as the uncaused cause of a nature we all share in common, but rather celebrates only individual desire as an originating cause of sex, gender, identity. This is not only capricious and rootless, but &#8220;the community&#8221; it forms is vicious and tyrannical. It&#8217;s for this reason that St. Augustine calls pride the libido dominandi &#8212; the lust for domination &#8212; and he describes this as a spiritual disposition which is fundamentally disordering. While he sometimes refers to this as a &#8220;city of man,&#8221; what he really means is a disordering principle rather than a city, more of an anti-politics than a politics proper, because it is actually deprives people of their own proper good, and blinds them to the ends which would elevate them in the way of goodness and happiness.</p><p>What would Augustine tell us? I think he would remind us of the limits of the limits of Plato&#8217;s philosopher-king. He would remind us that it&#8217;s not enough to have a ruler (or rulers) who may contemplate the one true God, yet who has does not offer &#8220;the right kind of worship.&#8221; The philosopher-king has the <em>spectare</em> but lacks true <em>latreia, being himself incapable of </em>offering the sacrifice which could truly make us adhere (<em>adhaerare</em>) or cling to God, &#8220;that final Good which makes possible our true felicity&#8221; (10.6). Augustine would remind us that the only universally acceptable sacrifice, the only &#8220;way out&#8221; of the feverish city comes by way of a Mediator who suffers for our humanity in his humanity, and so becomes the true sacrifice which would adhere us to God.</p><p>Augustine doesn&#8217;t deny the need for a philosopher-king, but such a ruler is not <em>per se</em> &#8220;the way out.&#8221; Rather Augustine points to the sacred rites of the Catholic Church to supply supplying the &#8220;right sort of worship&#8221; that must be offered to ppace souls and cities on the Way to happiness:&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;This is the sacrifice of Christians, who are &#8216;many, making up one body in Christ&#8217;. This is the sacrifice which the Church continually celebrates in the sacrament of the altar, a sacrament well-known to the faithful where it is shown to the Church that she herself is offered in the offering which she presents to God.&#8221; (10.6)&nbsp;</p><p>And it is in this light that we should view his very high view of Constantine and Theodosius. In the fifth book he had already asked the essential question that Romans asked: what will make Rome happy? We must ask ourselves this same question. But Augustine&#8217;s answer, like Plato&#8217;s, does indeed turn to the just ruler. </p><p>In the nineteenth chapter, Augustine answers the question directly: &#8220;As for those who are endowed with true piety and who lead a good life, if they are skilled in the art of government, then there is no happier situation for mankind than that they, by God&#8217;s mercy, should wield power.&#8221; (5.19) Though it is God alone who gives power to Julian the Apostate and Constantine alike, it is inarguably happier for a people to be ruled in ways which &#8220;see&#8221; by the light of the one true God than those who rule only in the shadows of false religion. It is for this reason that Augustine finally turns to his speculum, or &#8220;mirror&#8221; for &#8220;the Christian emperors.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;When we describe certain Christian emperors as &#8216;happy&#8217;, it is not because they enjoyed long reigns, or because they died a peaceful death, leaving the throne to their sons; nor is it because they subdued their country&#8217;s enemies, or had the power to forestall insurrections by enemies in their own land and to suppress such insurrections if they arose. All these, and other similar rewards or consolations in this life of trouble were granted to some of the worshippers of demons, as their due; and yet those pagan rulers have no connection with the Kingdom of God, to which those Christian rulers belong.&#8221;</p><p>Augustine avers that the Christian ruler does not look to any of these material goods, mere &#8220;temporal benefits&#8221; as the &#8220;highest good&#8221; for polities, but rather:</p><p>&#8220;We Christians call rulers happy, if they rule with justice; if amid the voices of exalted praise and the reverent salutations of excessive humility, they are not inflated with pride, but remember that they are but men; if they put their power at the service of God&#8217;s majesty, to extend his worship far and wide; if they fear God, love him and worship him; if, more than their earthly kingdom, they love that realm where they do not fear to share the kingship; if they are slow to punish, but ready to pardon; if they take vengeance on wrong because of the necessity to direct and protect the state, and do not satisfy their personal animosity; if they grant pardon not to allow impunity to wrong-doing but in the hope of amendment of the wrong-doer; if, when they are obliged to take severe decisions, as must often happen, they compensate this with the gentleness of their mercy and the generosity of their benefits; if they restrain their self-indulgent appetites all the more because they are more free to gratify, and prefer to have command over their lower desires than over any number of subject peoples; and if they do all this not for a burning desire for empty glory, but for the love of eternal blessedness; and if they do not fail to offer to their true God, as a sacrifice for their sins, the oblation of humility, compassion, and prayer. It is Christian emperors of this kind whom we call happy; happy in hope, during this present life, and to be happy in reality hereafter, when what we wait for will have come to pass.&#8221; (5.24)</p><p>This is Augustine&#8217;s speculum regum, or as it will later be called a speculum principum. Yet Augustine, ever the realist, does not place this standard far out of reach, but rather identifies two emperors in particular who &#8220;saw&#8221; by the light of this mirror. Who does he single out? He names two Christian emperors, and particularly praises the religious aspect of their rule, while mindful of their sins.&nbsp;</p><p>The first emperor he names is, of course, Emperor Constantine. &#8220;God, in his goodness . . . heaped worldly gifts such as no one would have dared to hope for, upon Constantine, who made no supplication to demons, but worshipped only the true God.&#8221; Augustine praises God for granting to Constantine &#8220;the honor of founding a city,&#8221; namely Constantinople, &#8220;which contained not a single temple or image of any demon.&#8221; (5.25) If this is Augustine passing over Constantine&#8217;s Christianization of the empire in silence then I can hardly recognize what it means for Augustine to still speak to us today.&nbsp;</p><p>The second ruler who unites the &#8220;speculative&#8221; to the political is Emperor Theodosius, about whom he has much more to say not only because Augustine has a living memory of the man but because he witnessed the way Theodosius used his political power &#8220;to help the Church against the ungodly by just and compassionate legislation,&#8221; just as the speculum regum recommends. Theodosius greatly expanded Constantine&#8217;s Christianization of the empire, and helped the Catholic Church by removing support for Arian heretics. &#8220;He ordered the demolition of pagan images, knowing that even this world&#8217;s prizes are not in the gift of the demons, but in the power of the true God.&#8221; (5.26) Most know that Bishop Ambrose, had condemned Theodosius to penance for his crimes against the people of Thessalonica, but what Augustine notes is not that Theodosius failed to rule justly at all times &#8211; he has no illusions about that &#8211; but instead praises Theodosius for his repentance! He writes that &#8220;nothing could be more wonderful than the religious humility he showed [before God certainly, but also Bishop Ambrose] after the grievous crime.&#8221; Augustine heaps the highest praise on Theodosius for being &#8220;more glad to be a member of that Church than to be a ruler of the world.&#8221; (5.26)&nbsp;</p><p><em>This is precisely what we need to make America happy: Christians who know their eternal city, and how to elevate, and yes, how to rule, the ones they live in now.</em> You don&#8217;t need a majority for this, but you do need a new elite who dare to rule in a way that leads us out of the feverish city&nbsp; &#8212; people like Constantine and Theodosius &#8212; men  who can tear down the images which disorder us, and who bind themselves to the great Christian reservoir of grace recognize that will make happy the soul and city alike.</p><div class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>The Galli were priests of the Great Mother (Cybele) who had castrated themselves and oversaw animal sacrifices every March 24th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

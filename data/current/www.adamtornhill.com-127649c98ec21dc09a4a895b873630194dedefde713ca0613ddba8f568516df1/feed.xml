 <title>The Joy of Clojure</title>
 <link>https://www.adamtornhill.com/reviews/joyofclojure.htm</link>
 <pubDate>Mon, 4 Mar 2013 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
 <description>
Languages evolve idioms for a reason. Idioms are mental shortcuts to expressive and robust solutions. They are the sign of expertise and true understanding. Mastering those idioms is the hardest part of learning any language. Given that Clojure has been around for almost six years now it has grown its fair share of idiomatic constructs. Some of them are radically different from other Lisps. The Joy of Clojure captures these idioms and serves as a guide for the intermediate Clojure programmer looking to bring his command of Clojure to the next level.

 <title>Clojure Programming</title>
 <link>https://www.adamtornhill.com/reviews/clojureprogramming.htm</link>
 <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
 <description>
 It's been three years since I embarked on my Clojure journey. I'd been following the language for some time before I wrote my first small programs. Clojure was this promising new language designed for a multi-core age and fueled by the potent open-source eco-system of the Java world. Most important to me, it was a Lisp. I've never got to spend enough time with Clojure. But I tried to keep up to date with the development, waiting for an opportunity to pick up Clojure where I left. As the opportunity knocked, Clojure Programming turned out to be a great guide to the simplicity and practicality of Clojure.

	As software developer and author of a technical book on patterns I obviously find value in the pattern format. 
	  And as a psychologist I see the links to our cognitive capabilities and the social value of patterns.
	  In this article I will detail my view on patterns and the value I see in them. 
	  Since patterns are a controversial topic, I will build the article around the criticism against patterns. Let the critics have the first word.

 <link>https://www.adamtornhill.com/reviews/fluentcsharp.htm</link>
 <pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2012 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
 <description>
	Let me state right up front that I'm not in the intended audience for this book. 
		Fluent C# is a book for beginners to programming. 
		Although I do feel like one from time to time, I've spent the better parts of my adult life hacking together software systems of all scales. 
		Reviewing a book for novices is hard. 
		My view will be quite different. 
		A reader with little programming experience is likely to focus on other aspects and will probably face different problems.

 <pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2012 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
 <description>
	Dear reader, I'm pleased to announce my first book, Patterns in C. 
	Patterns in C is a collection of idioms, design and architectural patterns in the C programming language. 
	The book highlights the value of patterns. 
	In the right context, patterns serve as an excellent tool for communication and reasoning. 
	The book provides a C programmer with techniques to benefit from the growing body of knowledge captured in patterns.
